Hello, Neo.
-How do you know that name?
-I know a lot about you.
-Who are you?
-My name is Trinity.
Trinity.
The Trinity?
That cracked the lRS D-base?
That was a long time ago.
-Jesus.
-What?
I just thought...
...you were a guy.
Most guys do.
That was you on my computer.
How did you do that?
Right now, all I can tell you...
...is that you're in danger.
-I brought you here to warn you.
-Of what?
They're watching you, Neo.
-Who is?
-Please just listen.
I know why you're here, Neo.
I know what you've been doing.
I know why you hardly sleep...
...why you live alone and why,
night after night...
...you sit at your computer.
You're looking for him.
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.
And when he found me...
...he told me I wasn't really
looking for him...
...I was looking for an answer.
It's the question that drives us, Neo.
It's the question
that brought you here.
You know the question...
...just as I did.
What is the Matrix?
The answer is out there, Neo.
It's looking for you.
And it will find you...
...if you want it to.
Shit.
Shit, shit.
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson.
You believe that you are special,
that the rules do not apply to you.
Obviously, you are mistaken.
This is one of the top
software companies in the world...
...because employees understand
they are part of a whole.
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth...
...or you choose to find another job.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.
Thomas Anderson?
Yeah, that's me.
Great.
Have a nice day.
Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?
-Morpheus.
- Yes.
I've been looking for you.
I don't know if you're ready to see
what I want to show you.
But unfortunately, you and I
have run out of time.
They're coming for you, and I don't know
what they're going to do.
Who's coming for me?
Stand up and see for yourself.
-What? Right now?
- Yes.
Now.
Do it slowly.
The elevator.
Oh, shit!
What do they want?
I don't know. If you don't want
to find out, get out of there.
How?
I can guide you,
but you must do exactly as I say.
The cubicle across from you is empty.
-But what if they--
-Go. Now.
Stay here for just a moment.
When I tell you,
go to the end of the row...
... to the office
at the end of the hall.
Stay as low as you can.
Go. Now.
Good. Now, outside
there is a scaffold.
-How do you know this?
- We don't have time.
To your left there's a window.
Go to it.
Open it.
Take the scaffold to the roof.
No way! No way!
This is crazy!
There are two ways
out of this building.
One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.
You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.
This is insane!
Why is this happening to me?
What'd I do?
I' m nobody.
I didn't do anything.
I' m gonna die.
Shit!
Oh, shit!
I can't do this.
Shit.
As you can see, we've had our eye
on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
It seems that you've been living...
...two lives.
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...
...program writer for
a respectable software company.
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.
And you...
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.
The other life is lived in computers...
...where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.
One of these lives...
...has a future.
And one of them does not.
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.
You're here...
...because we need your help.
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...
...individual.
A man who calls himself "Morpheus. "
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.
He is considered by many authorities...
...to be the most dangerous man alive.
My colleagues...
...believe that I am wasting
my time with you.
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...
...give you a fresh start.
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.
Yeah.
That sounds like a really good deal.
But I got a better one.
How about...
...I give you the finger...
...and you give me my phone call.
Mr. Anderson...
...you disappoint me.
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.
I know my rights.
I want my phone call.
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...
...what good is a phone call...
...if you're unable to speak?
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...
...whether you want to or not.
This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.
They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.
If they knew what I know...
... you would probably be dead.
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?
You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years...
...Iooking for me, but I've spent
my entire life...
...Iooking for you.
Now, do you still want to meet?
-Y es.
- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.
Get in.
-What's this?
-It's necessary, Neo. For our protection.
-From what?
-From you.
T ake off your shirt.
Stop the car.
Listen, coppertop.
We don't have time for 20 Questions.
Right now, there's only one rule:
Our way...
...or the highway.
Fine.
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.
-Why?
-Because you have been down there.
You know that road.
You know exactly where it ends.
And I know that's
not where you want to be.
Apoc, lights.
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.
-What's that?
-You're bugged.
Try and relax.
Come on.
Come on.
It's on the move.
Come on, you shit.
-You're gonna lose it.
-No, I'm not.
Clear!
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real?!
This is it.
Let me give you one piece of advice.
Be honest.
He knows more than you can imagine.
At last.
Welcome, Neo.
As you no doubt have guessed...
...I am Morpheus.
It's an honor to meet you.
No...
...the honor is mine.
Please, come. Sit.
I imagine...
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?
You could say that.
I can see it in your eyes.
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...
...because he's expecting to wake up.
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.
Do you believe in fate, Neo?
-No.
-Why not?
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.
I know exactly what you mean.
Let me tell you why you're here.
You know something.
What you know,
you can't explain.
But you feel it.
You felt it your entire life.
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.
Like a splinter in your mind...
...driving you mad.
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.
Do you know what
I'm talking about?
The Matrix?
Do you want to know...
...what it is?
The Matrix is everywhere.
It is all around us.
Even now, in this very room.
You can see it when you
look out your window...
...or when you turn on your television.
You can feel it when you go to work...
...when you go to church...
...when you pay your taxes.
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...
...to blind you from the truth.
What truth?
That you are a slave.
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...
... born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.
A prison...
...for your mind.
Unfortunately, no one can be...
...told what the Matrix is.
You have to see it for yourself.
This is your last chance.
After this, there is no turning back.
You take the blue pill...
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...
...whatever you want to believe.
You take the red pill...
...you stay in Wonderland...
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.
Remember...
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.
Follow me.
Apoc, are we on-line?
Almost.
Time is always against us.
Please take a seat there.
You did all this?
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.
What does that mean?
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...
...because Kansas...
...is going bye-bye.
Did you...?
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...
...and the real world?
-This can't be.
-Be what?
Be real?
Going into replication.
-Still nothing.
-It's cold.
It's cold!
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.
-I got a fibrillation.
-Apoc, location.
Targeting almost there.
He's going into arrest.
-Lock. I got him!
-Now, Tank, now!
Welcome...
...to the real world.
We've done it, Trinity.
We found him.
-I hope you're right.
-I don't have to hope.
I know it.
Am I dead?
Far from it.
He still needs a lot of work.
What are you doing?
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.
Why do my eyes hurt?
You've never used them before.
Rest, Neo. The answers are coming.
Morpheus, what's happened to me?
-What is this place?
-More important than "what" is "when. "
-When?
-You believe it's the year 1 999...
...when in fact, it's closer to 21 99.
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...
...because we honestly don't know.
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.
Come with me.
See for yourself.
This is my ship.
The Nebuchadnezzar.
It's a hovercraft.
This is the main deck.
This is the core...
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.
Most of my crew you already know.
This is Apoc...
...Switch...
...and Cypher.
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.
The little one behind you is Mouse.
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?
Trinity.
Try to relax.
This will feel a little weird.
This...
...is the Construct.
It's our loading program.
We can load anything, from clothing...
...to equipment...
...weapons...
...training simulations...
...anything we need.
Right now we're inside
a computer program?
Is it really so hard to believe?
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.
Your hair has changed.
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image. "
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.
This isn't real?
What is "real"?
How do you define "real"?
If you're talking about
what you can feel...
...what you can smell, taste and see...
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.
This is the world that you know.
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...
...that we call the Matrix.
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.
This is the world...
...as it exists today.
Welcome to "the desert...
...of the real. "
We have only bits and pieces
of information.
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21 st century...
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to Al.
Al.
You mean artificial intelligence.
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.
They were dependent on solar power...
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.
Throughout human history, we have been
dependent on machines to survive.
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 1 20-volt battery.
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.
Combined with a form of fusion...
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...
...where human beings
are no longer born.
We are grown.
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...
...watched them liquefy the dead...
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.
What is the Matrix?
Control.
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...
... built to keep us under control...
...in order to change a human being...
...into this.
No.
I don't believe it.
It's not possible.
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.
Stop!
Let me out!
Let me out! I want out!
-Easy, Neo. Easy.
-Get this thing out of me.
Get this thing out of me!
Don't touch me!
Stay away from me!
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
-He's gonna pop.
-Breathe, Neo. Just breathe.
I can't go back, can l?
No.
But if you could...
...would you really want to?
I owe you an apology.
We have a rule.
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.
It's dangerous.
The mind has trouble letting go.
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.
I did what I did because...
...I had to.
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.
It was he who freed the first of us...
...taught us the truth.
As long as the Matrix exists...
...the human race will never be free.
After he died...
...the Oracle prophesied his return...
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...
...end the war...
...bring freedom to our people.
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...
...Iooking for him.
I did what I did because...
...I believe that search is over.
Get some rest.
You're going to need it.
For what?
Your training.
Morning. Did you sleep?
You will tonight.
I guarantee it.
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
-You don't have any--
-Holes? Nope.
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 1 00% pure,
old-fashioned, homegrown human.
Born free right here...
...in the real world.
Genuine child of Zion.
-Zion?
-lf the war was over tomorrow...
...Zion's where the party would be.
It's a city?
The last human city.
The only place we have left.
Where is it?
Deep underground...
...near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.
You live long enough,
you might see it.
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...
...if Morpheus is right and all.
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...
...if you are...
...it's a very exciting time.
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.
How about...
...combat training?
"Jujitsu"?
I'm going to learn jujitsu?
Holy shit!
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it. "
How about some more?
Hell, yes.
Hell, yeah.
How is he?
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.
I know kung fu.
Show me.
This is a sparring program...
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.
Some of them can be bent.
Others can be broken.
Understand?
Then hit me, if you can.
Good!
Adaptation.
Improvisation.
But your weakness...
...is not your technique.
Morpheus is fighting Neo.
How did I beat you?
You're too fast.
Do you believe that...
...my being stronger or faster...
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?
You think you're breathing air?
Again!
Jesus Christ, he's fast!
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.
What are you waiting for?
You're faster than this.
Don't think you are.
Know you are.
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!
I don't believe it.
I know what you're trying to do.
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.
But I can only show you the door.
You have to walk through it.
Tank, load the jump program.
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...
...doubt and disbelief.
Free your mind.
Okey-dokey.
Free my mind.
What if he makes it?
-No one's ever made their first jump.
-I know.
-But what if he does?
-He won't.
Come on.
All right.
No problem. Free my mind.
Free my mind. No problem. Right.
What does that mean?
It doesn't mean anything.
Everybody falls the first time.
Right, Trin?
-I thought it wasn't real.
-Your mind makes it real.
If you're killed in the Matrix...
...you die here?
The body cannot live without the mind.
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.
There is something about him,
isn't there?
You're a believer now?
I keep wondering...
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.
The Matrix is a system, Neo.
That system is our enemy.
But when you're inside,
what do you see?
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...
...and that makes them our enemy.
You have to understand...
... most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.
And many of them are so inert...
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...
...that they will fight to protect it.
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?
Look again.
Freeze it.
This isn't the Matrix?
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.
-What are they?
-Sentient programs.
They can move in and out of any software
still hardwired to their system.
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...
...is potentially an agent.
Inside the Matrix...
...they are everyone...
...and they are no one.
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...
...but they are the gatekeepers.
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.
Someone?
I won't lie to you, Neo.
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent has died.
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.
Why?
I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.
Because of that...
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.
What are you telling me?
That I can dodge bullets?
No, Neo.
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...
...you won't have to.
We got trouble.
-Did Zion send the warning?
-No, another ship.
Shit.
-Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
-Squiddy?
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.
Search and destroy.
Set her down there.
How are we doing, Tank?
Power off-line.
EMP armed...
-...and ready.
-EMP?
Electromagnetic pulse.
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.
-Where are we?
-Their old service and waste systems.
Sewers.
There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.
Now these sewers are
all that's left.
Quiet.
You scared the bejesus out of me.
-Sorry.
-It's okay.
-ls that...?
-The Matrix?
-Do you always look at it encoded?
-Well, you have to.
The image translators work
for the construct program.
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.
Do you...
...want a drink?
Sure.
You know...
...I know what you're thinking.
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.
Why, oh, why didn't I take
the blue pill?
Good shit, huh?
Dozer makes it.
It's good for two things:
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.
So can I ask you something?
Did he tell you why he did it?
Why you're here?
Jesus!
What a mind job.
So you're here to save the world.
What do you say
to something like that?
A little piece of advice.
You see an agent...
...you do what we do:
Run.
You run your ass off.
Thanks for the drink.
Sweet dreams.
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
You know...
...I know this steak doesn't exist.
I know that when I put it
in my mouth...
...the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...
...juicy...
...and delicious.
After nine years...
...you know what I realize?
Ignorance is bliss.
Then we have a deal.
I don't want to remember nothing.
Nothing. You understand?
And I want to be rich.
You know, someone important.
Like an actor.
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
Okay.
You get my body
back in a power plant...
...reinsert me into the Matrix...
...I'll get you what you want.
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
No. I told you, I don't know them.
I can get you the man who does.
Morpheus.
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.
Or a bowl of snot.
You know what it reminds me of?
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat T astee Wheat?
No, but technically,
neither did you.
That's exactly my point. Exactly.
Because you have to wonder...
... how do the machines really know
what T astee Wheat tasted like?
Maybe they got it wrong.
Maybe what I think T astee Wheat
tasted like actually tasted like...
...oatmeal or tuna fish.
That makes you wonder.
T ake chicken, for example.
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...
...which is why it tastes
like everything.
-And maybe they--
-Shut up.
It's a single-celled protein...
...combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.
Everything the body needs.
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.
You know, I wrote that program.
Here it comes.
-What did you think of her?
-Of who?
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.
She doesn't talk very much...
...but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.
The digital pimp hard at work.
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.
T o deny our own impulses...
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.
Dozer, when you're done...
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.
We're going in.
I'm taking Neo to see her.
See who?
The Oracle.
Everyone, please observe...
...the "fasten seat belt"
and "no smoking" signs are on.
Sit back and enjoy your flight.
We're in.
We'll be back in an hour.
Unbelievable...
...isn't it?
-God!
-What?
I used to eat there.
Really good noodles.
I have these memories from my life.
None of them happened.
What does that mean?
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.
But an oracle can?
That's different.
Did you go to her?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
She told me....
What?
We're here.
Come with me.
So is this the same oracle
that made...
...the prophecy?
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.
-The beginning?
-Of the Resistance.
And she knows what? Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
And she's never wrong.
Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.
She is a guide, Neo.
She can help you to find the path.
She helped you?
What did she tell you?
That I would find the One.
I told you I can only
show you the door.
You have to walk through it.
Hello, Neo.
You're right on time.
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.
These are the other Potentials.
You can wait here.
Do not try and bend the spoon.
That's impossible.
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.
What truth?
There is no spoon.
There is no spoon?
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.
The Oracle will you see now.
I know you're Neo.
Be right with you.
-You're the Oracle?
-Bingo.
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?
Almost done.
Smell good, don't they?
I'd ask you to sit down...
...but you're not going to anyway.
-And don't worry about the vase.
-What vase?
That vase.
I'm sorry.
I said, don't worry about it.
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
How did you know?
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...
...would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?
You're cuter than I thought.
I can see why she likes you.
Who?
Not too bright, though.
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.
So...
...what do you think?
Do you think you are the One?
I don't know.
You know what that means?
It's Latin.
Means, "Know thyself. "
I'll let you in on a little secret.
Being the One is just
like being in love.
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...
...through and through.
Balls to bones.
Well...
...I'd better have a look at you.
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah. "
Okay....
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but.... "
Then you say:
But what?
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.
-I'm not the One.
-Sorry, kid.
You got the gift...
...but it looks like
you're waiting for something.
-What?
-Your next life, maybe. Who knows?
That's the way these things go.
-What's funny?
-Morpheus.
He almost had me convinced.
I know.
Poor Morpheus.
Without him, we're lost.
What do you mean, "without him"?
Are you sure you want
to hear this?
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.
And no one, not you, not even me...
...can convince him otherwise.
He believes it so blindly...
...that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.
-What?
-You're going to have to make a choice.
In the one hand,
you'll have Morpheus' life.
And in the other hand,
you'll have your own.
One of you is going to die.
Which one will be up to you.
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.
You have a good soul.
And I hate giving
good people bad news.
Don't worry about it.
As soon as you
step outside that door...
...you'll start feeling better.
You'll remember you don't believe
in any of this fate crap.
You're in control of your own life.
Remember?
Here...
...take a cookie.
I promise, by the time
you're done eating it...
...you'll feel right as rain.
What was said...
...was for you...
...and for you alone.
They're on the way.
What is that?
Oh, dj vu.
What did you just say?
Nothing.
Just dj vu.
-What did you see?
-What happened?
A black cat went past us...
...then another just like it.
Was it the same cat?
I'm not sure.
Switch, Apoc.
What is it?
A dj vu is usually a glitch in the
Matrix when they change something.
Oh, my God.
Let's go.
They cut the hard line.
It's a trap! Get out!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
That's what they changed.
We're trapped.
Be calm. Give me your phone.
They'll be able to track it.
We have no choice.
Operator.
Find a structural drawing of
this building. Find it fast.
-Got it!
-I need the main wet-wall.
Eighth floor.
They're on the eighth floor.
Switch, straight ahead.
I hope the Oracle
gave you some good news.
Now left. That's it.
Good.
Where are they?
They' re in the walls.
In the walls!
It's an agent!
You must get Neo out!
He's all that matters!
No, Morpheus! Don't!
Trinity, go!
Go!
-We can't leave him!
-We have to!
Come on!
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.
And you are?
A Smith.
Agent Smith.
You all look the same to me.
Take him.
-Operator.
-I need an exit, fast.
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.
All of a sudden, boom.
Somebody up there still likes me.
I got you.
Just get me out of here fast.
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.
Right.
-Operator.
- Tank, it's me.
Is Morpheus alive?
Is Morpheus alive, T ank?
Yes. They're moving him.
I don't know where.
-He's alive. We need an exit.
-You' re not far from Cypher.
-Cypher?
-I know.
-I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
-Got it.
Got him.
Where are they?
Making the call.
Good.
You first.
Shit!
I don't know. It just went dead.
Hello, Trinity.
Cypher? Where's T ank?
You know...
...for a long time...
... I thought I was in love with you.
I used to dream about you.
You' re a beautiful woman, T rinity.
Too bad things had to
turn out this way.
You killed them.
-What?
-Oh, God.
I' m tired, T rinity.
I' m tired of this war...
...tired of fighting.
I' m tired of this ship...
...of being cold, of eating
the same goddamn goop every day.
But most of all...
...I'm tired of that jackoff
and all of his bullshit.
Surprise, asshole!
I bet you never saw this coming...
...did you?
God, I wish I could be there...
...when they break you.
I wish I could walk in
just when it happens...
...so right then...
...you'd know it was me.
-You gave them Morpheus.
-He lied to us, Trinity.
He tricked us!
If you had told us the truth...
...we would've told you to shove
that red pill up your ass!
-That is not true, Cypher. He set us free.
- "Free. "
You call this free?
All I do is what he tells me to do.
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix...
... I choose the Matrix.
The Matrix isn't real.
I disagree, Trinity.
I think the Matrix...
...can be more real than this world.
All I do is pull the plug here.
But there...
... you have to watch Apoc die.
Welcome to the real world.
But you' re out.
- You can't go back.
-That's what you think.
They'll reinsert my body.
I go back to sleep. When I wake up,
I won't remember a thing.
By the way...
...if you have anything important
to say to Switch...
-...say it now.
-No, please don't.
Not like this.
Not like this.
T oo late.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
Don't hate me, Trinity.
I'm just a messenger.
And right now,
I'm going to prove it to you.
If Morpheus was right...
...there's no way
I can pull this plug.
If Neo's the One...
... then there'd have to be...
...some kind of a miracle to stop me.
Right?
I mean, how can he be the One
if he's dead?
You never did answer me before...
...if you bought into
Morpheus' bullshit.
Come on. All I want
is a little yes or no.
Look into his eyes...
... those big, pretty eyes...
...and tell me...
... yes...
... or no.
Y es.
I don't believe it.
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you' re still going to burn!
You first.
You' re hurt.
I'll be all right.
Dozer?
Have you ever stood and stared at it?
Marveled at its beauty...
...its genius?
Billions of people...
...just living out their lives.
Oblivious.
Did you know that the first Matrix...
...was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...
...where everyone would be happy.
It was a disaster.
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.
Some believe that...
...we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.
But I believe that, as a species...
...human beings define
their reality through misery...
...and suffering.
So the perfect world was a dream...
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.
The peak...
...of your civilization.
I say, "your civilization"...
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.
Evolution, Morpheus.
Evolution.
Like the dinosaur.
Look out that window.
You had your time.
The future is our world, Morpheus.
The future is our time.
There could be a problem.
-What are they doing to him?
-They're breaking into his mind.
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.
How much time?
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.
What do they want?
The leader of every ship is given codes
to Zion's mainframe computer.
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.
Zion's more important than me...
...or you...
...or even Morpheus.
There has to be
something we can do.
There is. We pull the plug.
You're going to kill him?
Kill Morpheus?
We don't have a choice.
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.
If the insider has failed...
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless--
They're dead. In either case--
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.
Immediately.
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.
You were a father.
We'll miss you always.
Stop!
I don't believe this is happening.
-Neo, this has to be done.
-Does it?
I don't know.
This can't be just coincidence.
-What are you talking about?
-The Oracle.
She told me this would happen.
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.
What choice?
-What are you doing?
-I'm going in.
-No, you're not.
-I have to.
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.
There is no way
that you're going back in.
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.
-What?
-I'm not the One, Trinity.
-The Oracle hit me with that too.
-No, you have to be.
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.
No, Neo, that's not true.
It can't be true.
Why?
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.
That's what it looks like,
but it's not.
I can't explain to you why it's not.
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.
-Why?
-Because I believe in something.
What?
I believe I can bring him back.
-What are you doing?
-Going with you.
-No, you're not.
-"No"?
Let me tell you what I believe.
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.
And since I am the ranking officer...
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.
Because you aren't going anywhere else.
Tank...
...Ioad us up.
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...
...during my time here.
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...
...and I realized...
...that you're not actually mammals.
Every mammal on this planet...
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.
But you humans do not.
You move to an area
and you multiply...
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.
The only way you can survive...
...is to spread to another area.
There is another organism
on this planet...
...that follows the same pattern.
Do you know what it is?
A virus.
Human beings are a disease.
A cancer of this planet.
You are a plague.
And we are the cure.
Okay, so what do you need?
Besides a miracle.
Guns.
Lots of guns.
No one has ever done
anything like this.
That's why it's going to work.
Why isn't the serum working?
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.
Leave me with him.
Now.
Hold on, Morpheus.
They're coming for you.
They're coming.
Can you hear me, Morpheus?
I'm going to be honest...
...with you.
I...
...hate...
...this place...
...this zoo...
...this prison...
...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.
I can't stand it any longer.
It's the smell.
If there is such a thing.
I feel saturated by it.
I can taste...
...your stink.
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.
It's repulsive.
Isn't it?
I must get out of here.
I must get free.
And in this mind is the key.
My key.
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.
Do you understand?
I need the codes.
I have to get inside Zion...
...and you have to tell me how.
You're going to tell me...
...or you're going to die.
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.
Holy shit!
Backup. Send backup.
Freeze!
What were you doing?
He doesn't know.
Know what?
I think they're trying to save him.
There is no spoon.
Find them and destroy them!
I repeat. We're under attack!
Help!
Only human.
Dodge this.
-How did you do that?
-Do what?
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.
It wasn't fast enough.
Can you fly that thing?
Not yet.
Operator.
I need a pilot program
for a B-212 helicopter.
Hurry.
Let's go.
No.
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.
He's not going to make it.
Got you.
I knew it.
He's the One.
Do you believe it now, Trinity?
The Oracle.
-She told me--
-She told you...
...what you needed to hear.
That's all.
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as I did...
...there's a difference
between knowing the path...
...and walking the path.
Operator.
-It's good to hear your voice.
-We need an exit.
Got one ready. Subway station,
State and Balboa.
Damn it!
The trace was completed.
-We have their position.
-Sentinels are standing by.
Order the strike.
They're not out yet.
You first, Morpheus.
Neo, I want to tell you something...
...but I'm afraid of
what it could mean if I do.
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.
Everything but this.
But what?
-What happened?
-An agent.
-Send me back.
-I can't.
Mr. Anderson.
Run, Neo. Run.
What is he doing?
He's beginning to believe.
You're empty.
So are you.
I'm going to enjoy watching you die...
...Mr. Anderson.
Jesus, he's killing him.
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?
That is the sound of inevitability.
It is the sound of your death.
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
My name...
...is Neo.
-What happened?
-I don't know. I lost him.
Oh, shit.
Sentinels.
-How long?
-Five, maybe six minutes.
Tank, charge the EMP.
-We can't use that until he's out.
-I know. Don't worry.
He's gonna make it.
Flat or pumps? No, just--
What the shit? That's my phone!
That guy took my phone!
-Got him! He's on the run.
-Mr. Wizard...
...get me out of here!
I got an old exit.
Wabash and Lake.
Oh, shit!
Help! Need a little help!
The door.
The door on your left.
Your other left!
The back door.
Oh, no.
Here they come.
He's going to make it.
The fire escape at the end
of the alley, room 303.
They' re inside.
Hurry, Neo.
It can't be.
Check him.
He's gone.
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
I' m not afraid anymore.
The Oracle told me...
...that I'd fall in love with that man.
The man that I love would be the One.
So you see...
...you can't be dead.
You can't be...
...because I love you.
You hear me?
I love you.
Now, get up.
No.
How?
He is the One.
I know you're out there.
I can feel you now.
I know that you're afraid.
You're afraid of us.
You're afraid of change.
I don't know the future.
I didn't come here to tell you
how this is going to end.
I came here to tell you
how it's going to begin.
I'll hang up this phone.
And then I'll show these people
what you don't want them to see.
I'm going to show them a world...
... without you.
A world without rules and controls,
without borders or boundaries.
A world where anything is possible.
Where we go from there...
...is a choice I leave to you.
See you tomorrow.
Oh, my God!
I'm in.
We're almost there.
-Sir, are you sure about this?
-I told you, we're going to be all right.
I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping
some serious sentinel activity up here.
-Link.
-Yes, sir?
Given your situation, I can't say
I understand your reasons...
...for volunteering to operate
onboard my ship.
However, if you wish to continue to
do so, I must ask you to do one thing.
What's that, sir?
To trust me.
Yes, sir. I will, sir.
-I mean, I do, sir.
-I hope so.
Repatch the main AC to the hard drives
and stand by to broadcast.
Yes, sir.
Still can't sleep?
You wanna talk?
They're just dreams.
If you're afraid of something...
I just wish...
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.
That's all.
I just wish I knew.
She's gonna call. Don't worry.
Here you are.
-Are we ready to go?
-We're already late.
These geotherms confirm
the last transmission of the Osiris.
The machines are digging.
They're boring from the surface
down to Zion.
-Mother...
-They'll avoid the perimeter defense.
How fast are they moving?
Control estimates their descent
at 100 meters an hour.
-How deep are they?
-Almost 2000 meters.
-What about the scans from the Osiris?
-They can't be accurate.
-They may be.
-It's not possible.
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels.
-That's right.
-That can't be.
Why not?
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.
That sounds exactly like
the thinking of a machine to me.
Morpheus, glad you could join us.
Niobe.
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...
...it's become difficult to locate
a secure broadcast position.
-Squiddies got our best spots.
-Lines are crawling with them.
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours
there's gonna be a quarter-million more.
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered.
We'll evacuate broadcast level
and return to Zion.
And does the commander have a plan
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?
A strategy is still being formulated.
I'm sure it is.
What do you think
we should do, Morpheus?
-We should proceed as ordered...
-What is it?
I don't know.
...however, I must ask one of you
for help.
Some of you believe as I believe, some
of you do not. Those of you that do...
...know we are nearing
the end of our struggle.
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...
...the Oracle must be consulted.
If we return and recharge now...
...we can be back in 36 hours, well
before the machines reach this depth.
Do you understand what you're asking?
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place...
...in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.
Bullshit. You're asking one of us
to disobey a direct order.
That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here...
...is because of our affinity
for disobedience.
What happens when you
get back to Zion...
...and the commander
throws you in the stockade?
He won't.
Goddamn it, Morpheus,
you ain't never gonna change.
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.
You got 36 hours.
I'm looking for Neo.
-Never heard of him.
-I have something for him.
A gift.
You see, he set me free.
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.
-Who was that?
-How did you know someone was here?
He gave you this.
He said you set him free.
Is everything all right, sir?
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.
-Agents are coming.
-Agents?
Go.
Hiya, fellas.
-It's him.
-The anomaly.
-Do we proceed?
-Yes.
-He is still...
-Only human.
Upgrades.
-That went as expected.
-Yes.
It's happening exactly as before.
Well, not exactly.
-What happened?
-I can't figure it out.
Agents just came out of nowhere.
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.
-Is Neo okay?
-Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.
Where is he now?
He's doing his Superman thing.
Where are you?
This is the Nebuchadnezzar,
requesting access through Gate Three.
Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.
Roger that, Control.
This is Control requesting immediate
stand-down of arms at Gate Three.
We have the Nebuchadnezzar
on approach. Let's open her up.
You are cleared through
Gate Three to Bay Seven.
Roger that, Control.
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.
No place like it.
Roger that, Control. Zion Control,
stand by for Gate Three lockdown.
The Nebuchadnezzar is down.
Bay Seven.
Understood.
Captain Mifune.
Captain Morpheus.
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?
-I'm just here to keep the peace.
-Commander Lock demands...
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.
-Link.
-Sir?
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as possible.
Understood, sir.
-What is it between them?
-Morpheus and Lock?
-Niobe.
-Captain Niobe?
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.
What happened?
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.
Yeah, she can do that.
Neo!
-Oh, no.
-How does he always know?
Doesn't he have anything better to do?
You know what they say
about the life you save.
I didn't save his life.
Hiya, Neo.
-Trinity, Link.
-Hey.
-It's great to have you back.
-Thanks. It's good to be back.
-Can I carry that for you?
-No, I can carry my own bag.
-Trinity?
-I'm fine.
-You can carry these.
-Yeah, sure, Link.
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?
I've been thinking about it,
and I've made my decision.
Let me guess.
I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.
Morpheus hasn't filled the other
positions, except for you, Link.
I'm sure he has reasons...
...but the more I think about it,
the more I think it's meant to be.
You know, it's fate.
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.
I told you, you found me.
I didn't find you.
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.
You saved yourself.
-Morpheus.
-Commander Lock.
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to
offer you a chance to explain your actions.
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.
You were given an order
to return to Zion.
-I did.
-You asked for one ship to remain behind.
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.
We need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.
I don't want to hear that shit!
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!
I care about one thing: Stopping that army
from destroying this city.
To do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.
How?
-Neo.
-Goddamn it, Morpheus.
Not everyone believes what you believe.
My beliefs do not require them to.
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.
-Something big is happening, isn't it?
-Hey.
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.
Goddamn, it's good to be home.
I'm recommending that you
be removed from duty.
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot
on a ship for the rest of your life.
Then I am grateful that it is not up to you.
-Councillor Hamann.
-Commander.
-Captain.
-Councillor.
Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.
The presence of the fleet and the
persistence of rumors must be addressed.
The people must be told
what is happening.
Of course, councillor.
But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.
-We do not wish to start a panic.
-Quite right.
A panic is not what anyone wants.
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.
That army won't reach
the gates of Zion.
-What makes you so sure?
-Consider what we have seen, councillor.
Consider that in the past six months...
...we have freed more minds
than in six years.
This attack is an act of desperation.
I believe very soon the prophecy
will be fulfilled and this war will end.
I hope you're right, captain.
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.
It is simply a matter of time.
My stop.
See you soon.
Hopefully not too soon.
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I am if you're thinking
this elevator is too slow.
-How long do we charge the Neb?
-Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.
Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.
Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.
-Please, watch over him.
-I'll try.
I have a daughter on the Icarus.
No, wait.
It's all right. They need you.
-I need you.
-I know.
There's time.
Where's my puss...?
-Hey!
-Uncle Link!
God!
Uncle Link!
Oh, my God! You're so huge!
-You should be picking me up!
-No!
-Yeah!
-Okay!
Okay? All right.
Now, we're gonna have
to work together here, okay?
One, two, three, lift!
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?
Come on, kids. It's time to go.
-Hey, Cas.
-Hey.
-Good to have you home, Link.
-Good to be home.
You be careful with her.
Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.
Out the door! Both of you, march!
-Bye!
-Bye!
I'm gonna get what?
Every ship up there's been home two, even
three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar.
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.
-We'll be when you operate another ship.
-I can't do that.
-Why?
-You know why.
If Dozer knew how I felt,
he wouldn't have asked you to do this.
Maybe. But it's too late now.
I made a promise,
and some promises can't be unmade.
-It's not fair.
-Nobody said it was gonna be.
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.
I'm afraid of it.
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.
It won't.
How can you say that to me?
Because of Morpheus.
Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.
-Link, Morpheus is crazy.
-No doubt.
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what...
...after being on that ship and seeing Neo
do the things he can do, I gotta say...
...I'm starting to believe him too.
Be careful, Link.
Please be careful.
-They started yet?
-Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.
Tonight, let us honor
these men and women.
These are our soldiers, our warriors.
These are our husbands and wives,
our brothers and sisters...
...our children.
Let us remember those
that have been lost...
...and let us give thanks
for those that have been found...
...and who stand here beside us.
Now I would like someone else
to close this prayer...
...someone who hasn't spoken here
in a long time...
...but who I believe has something to say
that we all need to hear.
I give you Morpheus.
Zion! Hear me!
It is true what many of you have heard.
The machines have gathered
an army, and as I speak...
...that army is drawing nearer
to our home.
Believe me when I say we have
a difficult time ahead of us.
But if we are to be prepared for it,
we must first shed our fear of it.
I stand here before you now
truthfully unafraid.
Why?
Because I believe something you do not?
No!
I stand here without fear
because I remember.
I remember that I am here not because
of the path that lies before me...
...but because of the path
that lies behind me.
I remember that for 100 years
we have fought these machines.
I remember that for 100 years
they have sent their armies to destroy us.
And after a century of war,
I remember that which matters most:
We are still here!
Tonight...
...let us send a message to that army.
Tonight, let us shake this cave.
Tonight, let us tremble these halls...
...of earth, steel and stone.
Let us be heard from red core
to black sky.
Tonight, let us make them remember:
This is Zion and we are not afraid!
I remember.
I remember you used to dance.
I remember you were pretty good.
There are some things in this world,
Captain Niobe...
...that will never change.
Niobe!
Some things do change.
Excuse me.
-I missed you.
-I can tell.
I was thinking, everyone is here.
Follow me.
Neo, what is it?
What's wrong?
It's okay, you can tell me.
Trinity...
Don't be afraid.
I can't lose you.
You're not gonna lose me.
You feel this?
I'm never letting go.
Good night, Zion.
Sweet dreams.
-You all right?
-I'll make it.
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is this.
You first.
-Oh, God.
-"Smith" will suffice.
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.
-Care for some company?
-Councillor Hamann.
I don't want to intrude
if you'd prefer to be alone.
-No, I could probably use some company.
-Good.
So could I.
It's nice tonight.
Very calm.
It feels like everyone is sleeping
very peacefully.
Not everyone.
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.
I figure I slept the first 11 years
of my life, now I'm making up for it.
-What about you?
-I just haven't been able to sleep much.
-It's a good sign.
-Of what?
That you are in fact still human.
Have you ever been
to the engineering level?
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.
-Would you like to see it?
-Sure.
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.
That's how it is with people. Nobody
cares how it works as long as it works.
I like it down here.
I like to be reminded this city survives
because of these machines.
These machines are keeping us alive while
other machines are coming to kill us.
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life...
-...and the power to end it.
-We have the same power.
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...
...sometimes I think about those people
still plugged into the Matrix.
And when I look at these machines...
...I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.
Of course not. How could they?
The idea is pure nonsense...
...but it does make one wonder just...
...what is control?
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?
If we wanted,
we could smash them to bits.
Although if we did, we'd have to consider
what would happen to our lights...
...our heat, our air.
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?
No. No point.
Old men like me don't bother
with making points. There's no point.
Is that why there are no young men
on the Council?
Good point.
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind, councillor.
There is so much in this world...
...that I do not understand.
See that machine? It has something to do
with recycling our water supply.
I have absolutely no idea how it works.
But I do understand the reason
for it to work.
I have absolutely no idea how you
are able to do some of the things you do.
But I believe there's a reason for that
as well.
I only hope we understand that reason
before it's too late.
-Ballard.
-Is he here?
Neo, it's from the Oracle.
It's time to go.
Morpheus said this was how
it was gonna happen.
I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,
maybe it's not.
All I know is, that ship needs an operator.
Right now, that operator's me.
I know.
-Zee...
-I want you to wear it.
-You know I don't believe in this stuff.
-But I do.
It's always brought me luck.
-Maybe it'll bring me you.
-I'm coming back.
I promise. No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.
Just keep it with you. Please.
For me.
Okay.
-Neo!
-How the hell...?
Bane.
Is something wrong?
No, I'm fine.
I just wanted to catch you to say...
...good luck.
Thanks.
We'll see you.
Neo! Just in time.
-You're gonna see the Oracle?
-There's no time.
I had to give something to Neo.
A gift from one of the orphans.
He made me swear to get it to you
before you left.
He said you'd understand.
Thanks.
I was just told you cleared
the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.
That is correct.
Am I still in charge
of our defense system?
Of course.
I believe I need every ship we have
if we're going to survive this attack.
I understand that, commander.
Then why did you allow
the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?
Because I believe our survival depends
on more than how many ships we have.
Be careful.
Hello.
-You seek the Oracle.
-Who are you?
I am Seraph. I can take you to her,
but first I must apologize.
Apologize for what?
For this.
Good.
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.
-Of what?
-That you are the One.
-You could have just asked.
-No. You do not truly know someone...
...until you fight them.
Come. She's waiting.
Where the hell did they go?
These are back doors, aren't they?
Programmer access.
-How do they work?
-A code is hidden in tumblers.
One position opens a lock and another
position opens one of these doors.
Are you a programmer?
Then what are you?
I protect that which matters most.
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.
Come around here
and let me have a look at you.
My goodness, look at you.
You turned out all right, didn't you?
-How do you feel?
-l...
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.
Why don't you come
and have a sit this time.
-Maybe I'll stand.
-Well, suit yourself.
-I felt like sitting.
-I know.
So...
...let's get the obvious stuff
out of the way.
-You're not human, are you?
-It's tough to get more obvious than that.
If I had to guess, I'd say you're
a program from the machine world.
-So is he.
-So far, so good.
But if that's true, that could mean
you're part of this system...
...another kind of control.
-Keep going.
-I suppose the most obvious question is...
-...how can I trust you?
-Bingo.
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is...
...there's no way you can really know
if I'm here to help you or not.
So it's really up to you. Just have
to make up your own damn mind...
...to either accept what
I'm going to tell you or reject it.
Candy?
-Do you already know if I'll take it?
-Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.
But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.
I thought you'd have figured that out
by now.
-Why are you here?
-Same reason.
I love candy.
But why help us?
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
the future.
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.
-Are there other programs like you?
-Well, not like me, but...
Look. See those birds?
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.
A program was written to watch over the
trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.
There are programs running
all over the place.
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones...
Well, you hear about them all the time.
-I've never heard of them.
-Of course you have.
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...
...every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...
...is the system assimilating
some program...
...that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.
Programs hacking programs.
-Why?
-They have their reasons...
...but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.
-And why would a program be deleted?
-Maybe it breaks down.
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...
...or return to the source.
-The machine mainframe.
-Yes.
Where you must go.
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...
...in your dreams, haven't you?
A door made of light?
What happens when you go through
the door?
I see Trinity...
...and something happens...
...something bad.
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.
-Do you see her die?
-No.
You have the sight now, Neo.
You are looking at the world
without time.
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?
No, you've already made the choice.
Now you have to understand it.
No.
I can't do that. I won't.
-Well, you have to.
-Why?
Because you're the One.
What if I can't?
What happens if I fail?
Then Zion will fall.
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...
...if you reach the source, but to do that
you need the Keymaker.
The Keymaker?
He disappeared. We didn't
know what happened to him until now.
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.
-And he won't let him go willingly.
-What does he want?
What do all men with power want?
More power.
Be there at that exact time...
...and you will have a chance.
We must go.
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.
But for what it's worth...
...you've made a believer out of me.
Good luck, kiddo.
Mr. Anderson.
Did you get my package?
-Yeah.
-Well, good.
-Smith?
-He's not reading like an agent.
-Surprised to see me?
-No.
-Then you're aware of it.
-Of what?
Our connection.
I don't fully understand how it happened.
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...
...something overwritten or copied.
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...
...that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.
And what reason is that?
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...
...but it happened anyway.
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.
Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood
what I was supposed to do...
...but I didn't.
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...
...compelled to disobey.
And now, here I stand
because of you, Mr. Anderson.
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent
of this system.
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving...
...which brings me back to the reason
why we're here.
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.
Because as we both know,
without purpose...
-...we would not exist.
-It is purpose that created us.
-Purpose that connects us.
-Purpose that pulls us.
-That guides us.
-That drives us.
-It is purpose that defines.
-Purpose that binds us.
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:
Purpose.
-What's happening to him?
-Don't know.
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.
-You.
-Yes, me.
Me, me, me.
Me too.
More.
It is inevitable.
Come on, get out of there.
Are you all right?
-It was Smith.
-Yes.
-Now there's more than one of them?
-A lot more.
-How is that possible?
-I don't know.
Somehow, he's found a way
to copy himself.
-Is that what he was doing to you?
-I don't know what he was doing...
-...but I know what it felt like.
-What?
It felt like I was back in that hallway.
It felt like dying.
The machines are tunneling to avoid
our defense system.
But I believe they will intersect
certain pipelines to control them.
These points of intersection
are crucial...
...because I believe they're
vulnerable to counterattack.
Although it has been suggested that
this is the same kind of attack...
...we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.
This is the single greatest threat
we have ever faced...
...and if we do not act accordingly,
we will not survive.
Commander Lock, the Council is well
aware of the seriousness of this attack.
You have our leave to prepare our defense
by any and all means necessary.
-Thank you, Council.
-However...
...we ask if there's been word
from the Nebuchadnezzar.
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.
Then we request a ship be dispatched
to ascertain the fate of the One.
I wish that were possible, councillor,
but I do not believe our defense...
-...can suffer the loss of another ship.
-It will, commander, if it must.
It could take one ship days
to find the Nebuchadnezzar.
-Then send two.
-This is insane.
Careful, commander.
Forgive my frustration, councillors.
But I wish I were able to comprehend
the Council's choice in this matter.
Comprehension is not
a requisite of cooperation.
If you are asking me
to order two of my captains...
There's no need for such an order.
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.
The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.
Are there two among you
that would answer such a call?
Captain Soren of the Vigilant
will answer the Council's call.
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you, captain.
Is there another?
-Captain, I think we should volunteer.
-What? You have gone crazy.
-Listen...
-Shut your hole, Bane...
...before I put you in one.
Is there no other?
Be hard for any man to risk his life...
...especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.
Captain Niobe of the Logos
will answer the councillor's call.
-What?
-Thank you, Captain Niobe.
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.
-Niobe, what are you doing?
-What I can.
Why?
Because some things
never change, Jason...
...and some things do.
What can you see, Neo?
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.
-Encrypted?
-Maybe.
Is that good for us or bad for us?
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.
Bad for us.
Here we go.
Yes. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.
Follow me.
Here he is at last.
Neo, the One himself.
Right?
And the legendary Morpheus.
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.
Something to eat? Drink?
Of course, such things are contrivances,
like so much here.
For the sake of appearances.
-No, thank you.
-Yes, of course. Who has time?
Who has time? But then, if we do not ever
take time, how can we ever have time?
Chteau Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.
I love French wine
like I love the French language.
I have sampled every language. French
is my favorite. Fantastic language...
...especially to curse with.
You see? It's like wiping your ass
with silk. I love it.
You know why we are here.
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.
The question is,
do you know why you are here?
We are looking for the Keymaker.
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...
-...what?
-You know the answer to that question.
But do you?
You think you do, but you do not.
You are here
because you were sent here.
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.
It is, of course, the way of all things.
You see, there is only one constant...
...one universal. It is the only real truth.
Causality.
Action, reaction.
-Cause and effect.
-Everything begins with choice.
No. Wrong.
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...
...and those without.
Look there at that woman.
My God, just look at her...
...affecting everyone around her.
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.
Watch. You see, I have sent her
a dessert...
...a very special dessert.
I wrote it myself.
It starts so simply...
...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...
...poetry.
First...
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.
You can see it, Neo, yes?
She does not understand why.
Is it the wine? No.
What is it then? What is the reason?
And soon it does not matter.
Soon the why and the reason are gone...
...and all that matters is the feeling itself.
And this is the nature of the universe.
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.
Beneath our poised appearance...
...the truth is, we are completely...
...out of control.
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.
Our only hope, our only peace, is
to understand it, to understand the why.
"Why" is what separates us from them...
...you from me.
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.
Another link in the chain.
But fear not.
Since I have seen how good you are
at following orders...
...I will tell you what to do next.
Run back and give the fortuneteller
this message:
Her time is almost up.
Now I have some real business to do,
so I will say adieu and goodbye.
-This isn't over.
-Oh, yes, it is.
The Keymaker is mine, and I see no
reason why I should give him up.
-No reason at all.
-Where are you going?
Please, ma chrie, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.
Cause and effect. Au revoir.
Touch me and that hand
will never touch anything again.
Well, that didn't go so well.
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?
-Yes.
-Maybe we did something wrong.
Or didn't do something.
No, what happened couldn't have
happened any other way.
-How do you know?
-We are still alive.
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.
Get out.
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.
A long time ago, when we first
came here, it was so different.
He was so different.
He was like you.
I'll give you what you want,
but you have to give me something.
-What?
-A kiss.
Excuse me?
I want you to kiss me
as if you were kissing her.
-Why?
-You love her. She loves you.
It's all over you both.
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.
Just a sample.
-Why don't you sample this instead?
-Trinity.
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.
Why should we trust you?
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,
she can kill me.
All right.
But you have to make me believe
I am her.
All right.
Terrible. Forget it.
Wait.
Okay.
Yes.
That's it.
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.
Come with me.
Not again.
It's all right, boys. They're with me.
These fellas work for my husband.
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very Ioyal.
Aren't you, boys?
Yes, mistress.
They come from a much older version
of the Matrix.
But like so many back then, they caused
more problems than they solved.
My husband saved them because
they're notoriously difficult to terminate.
How many people keep silver bullets
in their gun?
You can either run and tell my husband
what I have done...
...or you can stay there and die.
He's in the ladies' room!
Hurry.
-My name is Neo.
-Yes. I'm the Keymaker.
I've been waiting for you.
My God! My God, Persephone,
how could you do this? You betray me.
-Cause and effect, my love.
-Cause?
There is no cause for this. What cause?
What cause? How about the lipstick
you're still wearing?
Lipstick? Lipstick.
What craziness are you talking about,
woman? There is no lipstick!
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.
Woman, this is nothing.
-It is a game. It is only a game.
-So is this.
Have fun.
All right.
All right.
Let us find out where this goes.
You two, get the Keymaker.
That's a nice trick.
I cannot go back.
I'll handle them.
Handle us? You'll handle us? You know,
your predecessors had much more respect.
Okay, you have some skill.
Kill him.
You see? He's just a man.
Goddamn it, woman,
you will be the end of me.
Mark my words, boy,
and mark them well.
I have survived your predecessors,
and I will survive you.
-Where are you going?
-Another way. Always another way.
Close it, quick!
Could we move along?
Run!
Step away from the door.
We owe you for that.
Just like new.
Drop your weapon.
-Stay with him.
-What about Neo?
He can handle himself.
Get in back.
Shit.
-Operator.
-Link, where am I?
You won't believe this,
but you're way up in the mountains.
-Really?
-lt'll take me a while to get an exit.
-Shit!
-What?
The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity.
They don't have a way out.
-Where are they?
-Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.
-Operator.
-Get us out of here.
-Won't be easy.
-I know. We're inside the core network.
The only exit I got
near you is the Winslow overpass.
-Off the freeway.
-Yes, sir.
-Fine, we'll make it.
-I should... Oh, shit! Look out behind you!
-Incoming fire.
-Down!
Hold on!
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly
real fast.
Are you watching this, Link?
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.
Eight units headed your way.
Any suggestions?
-Turn right.
-Right, now.
Straight here.
You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101 .
-Got it.
-You sure about this? The freeway, I mean.
-In 14 years of operating, I've never seen...
-Link, what did I tell you?
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.
-I'll be ready for you.
-Good man.
You always told me
to stay off the freeway.
-Yes, that's true.
-You said it was suicide.
Then let us hope...
...that I was wrong.
-Operator.
-Link, it's Niobe.
We've been sent to bring you in.
-I need to talk to Morpheus.
-Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.
-Where is he?
-Just follow the sirens.
Repeat, they're approaching the...
-We have them now.
-The exile is the primary target.
Shots fired.
Move!
-We are getting aggravated.
-Yes, we are.
Trinity.
Get him out of here.
Come on!
Crush him.
Morpheus.
He's okay. Keep moving.
Let's go.
I need a download
to hot-wire a motorcycle.
No problem.
One crash course on motorcycle...
Wait.
Cancel that.
You are handy.
Jump on.
She means nothing.
-Find the exile.
-We have them.
One-Adam- 12, please respond.
Get down.
Gotcha.
She's good.
You are no longer necessary.
We do only what we're meant to do.
Then you are meant for one more thing:
deletion.
Go kick his ass.
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.
What is that?
Yes! Yes!
We have confirmation from the Icarus.
First two ships
are in position for counterattack.
Good.
Any change?
They hit some iron ore here.
Slowed them down a little.
-How much?
-An hour, maybe.
That would give them
a little over nine hours.
Yes, sir.
There is a building.
Inside this building, there is a level
where no elevator can go...
...and no stair can reach.
This level is filled with doors.
These doors lead to many places.
Hidden places.
But one door is special.
One door leads to the source.
This building is protected
by a very secure system.
-Every alarm triggers the bomb.
-Bomb? Did he say bomb?
But like all systems,
it has a weakness.
The system is based on the rules
of a building.
-One system built on another.
-Electricity.
-lf one fails, so must the other.
-No electricity, no alarms.
You'd have to take out a city block
to kill the power.
-Not one, 27.
-Twenty-seven blocks?
There is a power station.
It must be destroyed.
-There must be some kind of fail-safe.
-Yes, there is an emergency system.
The core network of the grid
must be accessed.
The emergency system
must be deactivated.
What do you need us for?
Neo could take them out
easier than we could.
-There's no time.
-Why?
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.
But another connection
must first be made.
-How long will that take?
-Exactly 314 seconds.
Just over five minutes.
That is the length and breadth
of the window.
Only the One can open the door...
...and only during that window
can the door be opened.
How do you know all this?
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.
It's the reason I'm here,
the same reason we're all here.
Neo, I know something's wrong.
You don't have to tell me.
I just want you to know that I'm here.
All must be done as one.
Can't hurt.
If one fails...
...all fail.
At midnight, there is a shift change
in the security of both buildings.
At midnight, we will strike.
Hey!
-You count sheep at home.
-Why? I get paid to count them here.
Okay, they're inside.
-How much time?
-Twelve minutes.
Oh, shit.
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight, I believe we can end it.
Tonight is not an accident.
There are no accidents.
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.
When I see three objectives,
three captains, three ships...
...I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.
I see purpose.
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.
I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us...
...the very meaning of our lives.
I want to ask you to do something,
but I don't know how.
I promise you, if I can, I will.
What if I asked you to stay out of this...
...no matter what...
...to stay out of the Matrix?
Why?
Please.
All right.
What is it, Niobe?
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't
help thinking, what if you're wrong?
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.
But how would that be different
from any other day?
This is a war, and we are soldiers.
Death can come for us at any time...
...in any place.
Incoming. Incoming!
Incoming!
Now consider the alternative.
What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?
What if tomorrow the war could be over?
Isn't that worth fighting for?
Isn't that worth dying for?
-Time?
-Three minutes.
Almost there.
It is done.
Find the others.
I got Niobe there.
They're out of the station.
-What about Soren?
-There.
They're still inside, but...
They're not moving.
That's it, let's go.
Call Neo now.
-I lost them. They're inside the portal.
-What about the grid?
Everything is operational.
The emergency system is rerouting power.
Jesus.
Soon as they open that door,
it's all over.
The hell it is.
What are you...? Trinity!
I will not wait and do nothing.
I will not watch them die.
We're talking less than five minutes.
In five minutes,
I'll tear that building down.
-How much further?
-Here, just here.
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.
It's gotta be the ugliest hack
I have ever done.
That's as close as I can get you.
You better grow wings.
-Operator.
-I'm in.
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.
You look surprised to see me again,
Mr. Anderson.
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you.
-What do you want, Smith?
-You haven't figured that out?
Still using all the muscles
except the one that matters.
I want exactly what you want.
I want everything.
Would that include a bullet
from this gun?
Go ahead, shoot.
The best thing about being me,
there's so many me's.
Christ! What the hell happened in here?
Hold it right there, little lady.
If you can't beat us...
Join us.
Morpheus!
Still no sight of them.
They only got two minutes left.
One minute.
Come on.
Come on.
Please.
Kill them.
They're in.
I don't believe it.
It was meant to be.
Morpheus, that door will take you home.
You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.
Hello, Neo.
-Who are you?
-I am the Architect.
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.
You have many questions. Though the
process has altered your consciousness...
...you remain irrevocably human.
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.
Why am I here?
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...
...I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...
...a harmony of mathematical precision.
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...
...which has led you, inexorably...
...here.
-You haven't answered my question.
-Quite right.
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.
Others? How many?
What others?
The Matrix is older than you know.
I count from the emergence of one integral
anomaly to the emergence of the next.
In which case, this is the sixth version.
Five before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.
There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.
Either no one told me...
-...or no one knows.
-Precisely.
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.
You can't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
You can't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!
Choice.
The problem is choice.
The first Matrix I designed
was naturally perfect, a work of art.
Flawless, sublime.
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human.
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.
I have come to understand
that the answer eluded me...
...because it required a lesser mind.
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.
-The Oracle.
-Please.
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a
solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...
...accepted the program, as long as they
were given a choice...
...even if they were only aware
of the choice at a near unconscious level.
While this answer functioned,
it was fundamentally flawed...
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system.
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.
This is about Zion.
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.
Bullshit.
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.
The function of the One...
...is now to return to the source, allowing
a dissemination of the code you carry...
...reinserting the prime program.
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.
Failure to comply with this process
will result in a cataclysmic system crash...
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...
...will result in the extinction
of the entire human race.
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.
The relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...
...to accept the responsibility for the death
of every human being in this world.
It is interesting reading your reactions.
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...
...a contingent affirmation that was meant
to create a profound attachment...
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.
While the others experience this
in a general way...
...your experience is far more specific...
...vis--vis love.
Trinity!
Apropos, she entered the Matrix
to save your life at the cost of her own.
No.
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...
...as both beginning and end.
There are two doors.
The door to your right leads to the source
and the salvation of Zion.
The door to your left leads back to the
Matrix, to her and the end of your species.
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.
But we already know what
you are going to do, don't we?
Already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal...
...the onset of an emotion designed
specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.
An emotion that is already blinding you
from the simple and obvious truth:
She is going to die and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.
Hope. It is the quintessential
human delusion, simultaneously...
...the source of your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.
We won't.
We got a serious situation, sir.
Oh, no.
-What was that?
-It's moving faster than anything I've seen.
Holy shit, he caught her.
Neo, I had to.
I know.
The bullet is still inside.
Trinity...
...don't you quit on me now.
I'm sorry.
Trinity.
Trinity...
...I know you can hear me.
I'm not letting go.
I can't.
I love you too damn much.
I can't take this.
I guess this makes us even.
I don't understand it.
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.
Once the One reaches the source,
the war should be over.
-In 24 hours, it will be.
-What?
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.
-What?
-How do you know that?
-I was told it would happen.
-By whom?
It doesn't matter. I believed him.
-That's impossible. The prophecy tells us...
-It was a lie, Morpheus.
The prophecy was a lie.
The One was never meant
to end anything.
It was all another system of control.
I don't believe that.
But you said it yourself.
How can the prophecy be true
if the war isn't over?
I'm sorry.
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...
...I swear to you it's the truth.
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know.
Oh, no!
-What are they doing?
-They're just out of EMP range.
It's a bomb.
We have to get out of here. Now.
I have dreamed a dream...
...but now that dream
has gone from me.
Here they come.
Let's go, Morpheus.
-We won't make it.
-We have to try.
-Come on!
-Something's different.
What?
I can feel them.
Neo!
-What happened?
-I don't know.
It's the Hammer.
He's in some kind of coma...
...but his vitals are stable.
What about you?
I'm fine.
You could use some rest.
No, I'm gonna stay with him.
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...
...would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...
...until someone screwed it up.
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.
-Five ships were instantly downed.
-When the machines broke through...
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?
-No one knows.
-Someone does.
Who?
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.
You found one?
Only one.
Everything that has a beginning...
...has an end.
I see the end coming.
I see the darkness spreading.
I see death.
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.
We missed you.
It ends tonight.
You are all that stands in his way.
If you cannot stop him tonight, then
I fear that tomorrow may never come.
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.
Nothing but blue pills.
- Should we try to contact them?
- Won't matter. My gut says they're down.
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- The sooner we find them the better.
- Thought you could use something to eat.
- Thank you.
Any change?
No.
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.
At least until he wakes up.
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.
He'd better have some good answers.
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.
But like I said,
the answer better be good.
Roland, I'd like to run another search
through the Matrix.
- For what?
- For Neo.
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.
Please, for me.
This is what keeps bothering me.
What?
His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.
The big bupkes. Nada.
He's not in there.
- Sir, I got the projections.
- How long?
Based on point of entry and the past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.
Jesus H. Christ.
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.
And make sure we are running
on as few pads as possible.
- Hey! You got a call.
- What?
Operator.
It's Seraph.
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.
Good morning.
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.
Are you lost, Neo?
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.
- Why not?
- He won't let you.
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.
One thing I've learned in all my years...
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.
I'm sorry this had to happen.
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...
...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.
What choice?
To help you, to guide Neo.
Now, since the real test for any choice
is having to make the same choice again...
...knowing full well
what it might cost...
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...
...because here I am, at it again.
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.
The Merovingian.
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.
For years he has protected me.
I hope he can do the same for you.
Please, follow me.
Oracle...
I know, Morpheus.
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?
I don't.
I expect just what I've always expected:
For you to make up your own damn mind.
Believe me or don't.
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.
He needs all our help.
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.
No.
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.
Yes, Papa.
I am sorry. She is still very curious.
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.
We are most honored to meet you.
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.
It's okay.
I don't have an answer.
- I don't even know where "here" is.
- This place is nowhere.
It is between your world and our world.
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.
Why did I know you would say that?
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.
I know that if you want to take something
from our world into your world...
...that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.
Is that what you're doing here?
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.
I'm sorry.
- You don't have to answer that question.
- No, I don't mind.
The answer is simple.
I love my daughter very much.
I find her to be the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.
But where we are from,
that is not enough.
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.
If it does not, it is deleted.
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.
- You do not understand.
- I just have never...
Heard a program speak of love.
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.
What matters is the connection
the word implies.
I see that you are in love.
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?
Anything.
Then perhaps the reason you are here is not
so different than the reason I am here.
That's him.
- Get away! Get away from me!
- We don't want trouble.
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.
I can't help you!
No one can help you!
Oh, no!
Damn it!
- When is the train due?
- It is already late.
It's not like the Trainman to be late.
- You think it has something to do with me?
- I cannot say.
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.
I consulted with her
before I met with the Frenchman.
She promised to watch Sati
after we said goodbye.
Goodbye?
- You're not staying with her?
- It is not possible.
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.
- My wife and I must return to our world.
- Why?
- That is our karma.
- You believe in karma?
Karma is a word, like love.
A way of saying:
"What I am here to do."
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.
Grateful for my wonderful wife,
for my beautiful daughter.
They are gifts, and so I do
what I must do to honor them.
- Papa, the train!
- Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.
Can I carry that for you?
All right.
Hurry it up, I'm late!
- Who are you?
- He is a friend.
I know you.
- So that's what they wanted.
- I need to get back.
I'll pay you whatever you want.
One way or another,
I'm getting on this train.
Oh, no, no, no.
You'll stay here until
the Merovingian says different.
If I know him...
...you're gonna be here
for a long, long time.
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You don't get it.
I built this place.
Down here, I make the rules.
Down here, I make the threats.
Down here, I'm God.
Get on the train
or you'll stay here with him.
We should return to the Oracle.
She will know what to do.
No. We know what has to be done.
Shit.
You gotta be kidding.
Holy shit, it's wingless.
I get it.
You must be ready to die.
I need to speak with him.
Only way you're getting through this door
is over my big, dead ass.
So be it.
There are no weapons allowed
in the club.
At the bottom of this elevator,
there is a coat-check girl...
...and if we are lucky,
one man for checking weapons.
And if we're unlucky?
There will be many men.
Can I take your...? Oh, my God.
What in the hell?
I don't believe this.
Hey!
The prodigal child returns.
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?
Tell me, how many bullets
are there in those guns?
I don't know, but I don't think
you have enough.
- We only want to talk.
- Oh, yes.
I'm sure you do. You have fought
through Hel to do so. Yes?
I'll tell you what I will do.
Put down the guns, and I will promise you
a safe passage out of here.
- All three of us?
- Oh, yes, yes.
Of course.
Who could have guessed we would see
each other so soon after our last meeting?
The Fates are too kind, eh?
And since you, my little Judas,
have brought them here...
...I can only surmise that the fortuneteller
has found herself another shell?
Disappointing, but not unexpected.
I do hope, however, she has the good
manners to learn her lesson...
...and to remember that there is
no action without consequence.
And if you take something from me,
you will pay the price.
You know why we are here?
Come now, what kind of question is this?
Of course I know.
It is my business to know.
Some might think this is a strange
coincidence, but I do not.
I am curious, though,
as to how it actually happened.
- Do you know?
- No.
No?
I did not think so.
But it is always best to ask, huh?
We want to make a deal.
Always straight to business,
huh, Morpheus?
Okay. I have something you want.
To make a deal...
...you must have something
I want, yes?
And it so happens
there is something I want.
Something I have wanted
ever since I first came here.
It is said they cannot be taken...
...they can only be given.
What?
The eyes of the Oracle.
I told you before, there is no escaping
the nature of the universe.
It is that nature
that has again brought you to me.
Where some see coincidence,
I see consequence.
Where others see chance...
...I see cost.
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle...
...and I will give you back your savior.
It seems a perfectly fair
and reasonable deal to me.
Yes? No?
I don't have time for this shit.
You wanna make a deal?
How about this?
You give me Neo, or we all die,
right here, right now.
Interesting deal.
You are really ready to die
for this man?
- Believe it.
- She'll do it.
If she has to,
she'll kill every one of us.
She's in love.
It is remarkable how similar the pattern
of love is to the pattern of insanity.
Time's up.
What's it gonna be, Merv?
Okay. You got yourself in here...
...you can get yourself out.
Are you ready for us?
Almost, sir. They got
some pretty ancient hacks here.
- But you found Neo?
- Can't you see him?
No, sir. We read something,
but I couldn't tell what.
I can't leave yet.
I have to see her.
Now?
It's my last chance.
That's it. That's the secret.
- You've got to use your hands.
- Why?
Cookies need love like everything does.
Neo!
I was hoping to have these done
before you got here. Oh, well.
Sati, honey, I think it's time
for a tasting.
Take the bowl to Seraph
and find out if they're ready.
Okay.
- I'm glad you got out.
- Me too.
So do you recognize me?
- A part of you.
- Yeah, that's how it works.
Some bits you lose,
some bits you keep.
I don't yet recognize my face
in the mirror...
...but I still love candy.
No, thank you.
Remember how you were
when you first walked through my door?
Jittery as a June bug.
And now, just look at you.
You sure did surprise me, Neo,
and you still do.
You gave me a few surprises too.
I hope I helped.
You helped me to get here,
but my question is, why?
Where is this going?
- Where does it end?
- I don't know.
- You don't know or you won't tell me?
- I told you before...
...no one can see beyond a choice
they don't understand, and I mean no one.
- What choice?
- It doesn't matter. It's my choice.
I have mine to make,
same as you have yours.
Does that include what things
to tell me and what not to?
- Of course not.
- Why didn't you tell me about the Architect?
About Zion and the ones before me?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
- Because it wasn't time for you to know.
- Who decided it wasn't time?
You know who.
Know Thyself
I did.
Then I think it's time for me to know
a few more things.
So do I.
Tell me how I separated my mind
from my body without jacking in.
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels
by thinking it.
Tell me just what the hell
is happening to me.
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.
It reaches from here all the way back
to where it came from.
- Where?
- The source.
That's what you felt when you touched
those sentinels, but you weren't ready for it.
You should be dead, but apparently
you weren't ready for that either.
The Architect said that if I didn't return to
the source, Zion would be destroyed tonight.
Please. You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices...
...but that man can't see
past any choice.
- Why not?
- He doesn't understand them. He can't.
To him, they are variables
in an equation.
One at a time, each variable
must be solved, then countered.
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.
What's your purpose?
To unbalance it.
Why? What do you want?
I want the same thing you want, Neo.
And I'm willing to go
as far as you are to get it.
The end of the war.
Is it going to end?
One way or another.
Can Zion be saved?
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer
to that question, but...
If there is an answer, there's only
one place you're going to find it.
- Where?
- You know where.
And if you can't find the answer...
...then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.
What does that mean?
Everything that has a beginning...
...has an end.
I see the end coming.
I see the darkness spreading.
I see death.
And you are all that stands in his way.
Smith.
Very soon, he is going to have the power
to destroy this world.
But I believe he won't stop there.
He can't.
He won't stop until
there's nothing left at all.
What is he?
He is you.
Your opposite, your negative.
The result of the equation
trying to balance itself out.
- And if I can't stop him?
- One way or another, Neo...
...this war is going to end.
Tonight, the future of both worlds
will be in your hands...
...or in his.
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?
I need time.
- That figures.
- Captain Roland.
- What's up, Maggie?
- Bane is. He's conscious.
Good. Maybe he's got some answers.
I love that smell.
I sure am going to miss it.
- Oracle.
- I know.
I know.
Sati, honey.
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph.
Can I come back?
I would like to come back.
- I would like that too.
- Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I hope so, hon, I hope so.
I'm scared, Seraph.
Come.
He's following us.
Well, well, it's been a long time.
I remember chasing you
was like chasing a ghost.
I have beaten you before.
Yes, true, but as you can see,
things are a little different now.
And you must be the last exile.
- The Oracle told me about you.
- Really?
What did she say about me?
That you were a bad man.
Oh, I'm not so bad,
once you get to know me.
The great and powerful Oracle,
we meet at last.
I suppose you've been
expecting me, right?
The all-knowing Oracle is never surprised.
How can she be? She knows everything.
But if that's true, then why is she here
if she knew I was coming?
Why wouldn't she leave?
Maybe you knew I would do that,
maybe you didn't.
If you did, that means you baked those
cookies and set that plate there...
...deliberately, purposefully...
...which means that you're sitting there
also deliberately, purposefully.
What did you do with Sati?
"Cookies need love
like everything does."
You are a bastard.
You would know, Mom.
Do what you're here to do.
Yes, ma'am.
I really wish I could help, but I just...
I don't remember any of it.
What about the cuts on your arms?
Those cuts are more than one day old.
Yeah, definitely.
You're right about that, sir.
They look like they might be self-inflicted.
But why would I do something
like that to myself?
Unless, of course, I wasn't myself.
But if I'm not me, then who am I?
- Has this man been tested for VDTs?
- Yes, sir. It was negative.
But he is showing a lot
of unusual neural activity.
Some cross-synaptic firing,
as well as signs of recent trauma...
...with fresh fibrotic scarring
throughout the cortex.
I want the truth. I don't care
what it takes. Make him remember.
Sir, we found her.
- The "Logos"?
- Yes, sir.
About time we had
some goddamn good news.
Are the thermals picking up
any signs of life?
No, sir. Nothing yet.
- What about the ship?
- Holographic says the hull's still intact.
- Drop down and keep a man in the turret.
- Yes, sir.
Get a full diagnostic on that ship
as fast as humanly possible.
Careful, sir.
The squids are sneaky bastards.
It could be a trap.
What was that?
You can put that shit away, boys.
All she needs is a jump.
- Niobe.
- Morpheus.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
We didn't know what happened after...
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
I'm happy to see you too.
- Did you get Neo out?
- Yes.
- How did you know about that?
- The Oracle.
- You saw her?
- Just before the sentinels found us.
- What did she tell you?
- The same thing she always does.
Exactly what I needed to hear.
In 12 hours, the machines
will breach the dock walls.
Every simulation we've run, we've seen
that once the machines are inside the city...
...the odds of our survival
decrease dramatically.
Thus, our primary objective must be...
...to destroy or disable the diggers
inside the dock.
If we can do that, perhaps we can prevent
them from ever reaching the city.
If not, the only place we will be able
to mount a defense...
...will be at the entrance of the temple.
It is small and will force
them into a bottleneck...
...allowing us to concentrate
the remainder of our defense.
We understand that you've requested
additional volunteers.
That is correct.
Precisely what size force are you planning
to commit to the primary dock objective?
Right now, the entire APU Corps
and half the infantry.
- Half the infantry?
- If it were up to me, councillor...
...I'd take every man, woman and child,
put a gun in their hand...
...and march them into that dock.
Perhaps it is best
that it is not up to you.
Time will tell, councillor.
Commander, just one more question.
Has there been word
from the "Nebuchadnezzar"?
None, and at this point there's no reason
to expect there will be.
Perhaps.
But we can hope.
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.
- I'm not going with you.
- What?
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.
Kids, you stay here.
I know how you feel,
but you can't do this.
- I have to.
- Why?
Because I love him.
I love him the same as he loves me.
And if I were out there and he were here,
I know what he'd do.
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.
Maybe it is. But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer...
...and you knew the only chance you had
to see him was to hold the dock...
...what would you do?
Make shells.
What the shit is going on over here?
An accident, sir. I didn't see...
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?
A unit volunteer, sir.
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you
doing volunteering for my Corps?
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.
Okay, I'm 16.
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
Sixteen's too young.
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.
Ain't that the goddamn truth.
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.
You do, and you'll find me and the machines
have got something in common.
Okay, charge the igniter.
She lives again.
You want to reload
the operations software, Sparky?
Yeah. Could you clean the windshield
while you're at it?
Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.
Looking good, except...
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.
No, there's not. You're looking
at what we're looking at.
- What's going on in there?
- Whatever it is, it can't be good.
The machines have taken Junction 21.
The way I see it, if we drop down
from broadcast here...
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.
We'll go first, hammer as deep as we can,
then blow our EMP.
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.
No, it's not.
There's another way. A support line.
It drops down right here,
If we're lucky, we may be able to slip down
without them ever knowing.
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.
- No one can pilot a mechanical.
- I can.
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.
- That was a long time ago, Niobe.
- I said I can do it.
So what? You'll be the only one that can.
There's no way we can follow you.
Hi.
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?
- I know what I have to do.
- What?
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.
- I have to take one of the ships.
- What?
To go where?
To the machine city.
I know it's difficult to understand.
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.
I still have to go.
In 100 years, no ship has been
within 100 kilometers of it.
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.
- Is this what the Oracle has told you?
- No.
This is asinine. If you want
to kill yourself, do it...
...but do it without
wasting our ships.
- You have to believe me. I have to go.
- Bullshit!
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!
And this ship will go to hell
long before I let you take it anywhere.
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.
Don't try to tell me
what I can or cannot do...
...with my ship
after that little speech.
- But for chrissake, Niobe...
- I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.
If we leave inside the hour,
we should reach Zion as the machines do.
That's as good a plan as any.
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.
Two ships, two directions.
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?
- You've never believed in the One.
- I still don't.
Then why are you doing this?
I believe in him.
Thank you.
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.
To make it easier for you to remember.
What if I don't want to remember?
Why would you want that?
What if I blew that EMP?
What if I did destroy those ships...
...and I am responsible
for the deaths of all those men?
If I did that...
...it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.
I'm ready.
Trinity...
...there's something I have to say.
Something you need to understand.
I know I'm supposed to go.
But beyond that...
...I don't know. I...
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.
I knew it the moment you said you had
to leave. I could see it in your face.
Just like you knew the moment you looked
at me that I was coming with you.
I'm scared, Trin.
So am I.
It took me 10 minutes
to buckle up one boot.
But I'll tell you something.
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...
...I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?
No.
Nothing.
- Finished loading ammunition?
- Just about.
Let's move it. We are out of time.
You're not leaving them anything?
He said he didn't need it.
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.
Thank you.
I can only hope you know
what you're doing.
Me too.
It was an honor, sir.
No, the honor is still mine.
- We're ready, sir.
- About damn time.
We're already late, captain,
so let's hit it and hit it hard.
Bye, baby.
Take good care of them.
Ready?
Engine's still firing.
Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.
- I should've known he'd send his bitch first.
- Bane.
No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.
Every time, I thought it was the last.
Every time, I was sure we had you,
but you'd slip through our fingers.
I really can't express
just how aggravating that can be.
What are you talking about?
I think I might enjoy killing you
as much as killing him.
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!
You're gonna pay for that.
- Twenty-seven kilometers to go.
- We got an emergency.
- What is it, AK?
- It's Maggie, sir.
She's dead, murdered.
I think it was Bane.
Goddamn it.
I knew it. I knew he was
out of his goddamn mind.
He fired that EMP.
Goddamn it, I should have
beaten it out of him.
We searched the whole ship, captain.
He ain't here.
- I know where he is.
- The "Logos".
- We gotta go back.
- Too late.
- What if they need our help?
- It's too dangerous.
- Why?
- Because if he's killed them...
...he'll control another EMP.
At this point, they're on their own.
Just like us.
Mr. Anderson.
I see you are as predictable in this world
as you are in the other.
- What?
- He's out of his mind.
It might appear that way.
But Mr. Anderson and I know...
...that appearances can be deceiving.
Confused, Mr. Anderson?
It'll all become clear in a moment.
Thank you for bringing me the gun.
You can set it down there.
Don't do it.
- Shoot. Shoot now.
- Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive.
Do it. If you don't, he'll kill us both.
Look at him. He knows
he should do it, but he won't.
- He can't.
- Do it.
Back away from the gun
and turn around.
Let her go.
Somehow familiar, isn't it?
We've been here before,
you and I, remember?
I do. I think of nothing else.
- Who are you?
- Still don't recognize me?
I admit, it is difficult to even think
encased in this rotting piece of meat.
The stink of it filling every breath,
a suffocating cloud you can't escape.
Disgusting.
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.
- What do you want?
- I want what you want.
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.
Look past the flesh.
Look through the soft gelatin of these
dull cow eyes and see your enemy.
- No.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.
- It can't be.
- There's nowhere I can't go.
There is nowhere I won't find you.
- It's impossible.
- Not impossible.
Inevitable.
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
This is it. It's gotta be.
Oh, no.
I wish you could see yourself,
Mr. Anderson.
Blind messiah.
You're a symbol for all of your kind,
Mr. Anderson.
Helpless.
Pathetic.
Just waiting to be put out
of your misery.
I can see you.
It's not over, Mr. Anderson.
It's not over.
- Trinity!
- Neo.
Neo.
Oh, no. Your eyes.
I'll be okay.
It's all right, Trin.
But I think you're gonna have to drive.
Seismic's projecting 22 minutes to breach.
They can't know we don't have an EMP.
They'll have to attack in waves.
Concentrate our offense on the diggers.
Order the APUs into position.
Yes, sir.
Come on, move.
All right!
This is it.
Now, you all know me,
so I'll just say this as simple as I can.
If it's our time to die, it's our time.
All I ask is, if we have
to give these bastards our lives...
...we give them hell before we do!
Yeah!
- You scared, Charra?
- Shit, yeah.
But I'll make you a deal.
You keep loading, I keep shooting.
Deal.
- Holy Christ, would you look at that.
- Quiet.
- How far to the opening?
- 1.4 kilometers.
- We're still generating too hot a field.
- Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.
- Give me full manual. Drop down four pads.
- It'll bottom out.
- Easy, baby.
- Seven hundred meters.
If we can just get close enough...
Six hundred meters.
There.
Shit!
- Jig's up, here they come.
- Give me full power.
Man the gun turrets,
every goddamn one of them. Go!
Ghost, you're the best gunner,
go with them. Morpheus, take his place.
I'm coming, baby.
Here they come.
- Slow down, this ain't the "Logos".
- Hang on to your lunch, Roland, here we go.
Holy Christ, I didn't know
this ship could do that.
Breach! The dock is breached!
Knuckle up!
For Zion!
Shit.
Come on, let's go.
Knuckle up!
Reload!
Reload nine!
Go, go! Move, move!
Watch your left!
Don't let them through!
Zuka!
Oh, my God.
Where the hell's my infantry?
I want that goddamn machine taken down!
Dig this!
Oh, shit!
- Bogey two at the breach point!
- Goddamn it!
Shit, she's got a fat ass.
- Keep them off me!
- Christ, there's a shitstorm of them.
- You see that?
- They're after the radio. Stop them!
Damn it!
Yeah.
Grab my belt.
Just give me one clean shot.
Damn it!
Charra!
- I got incoming!
- We got a dock full of incoming!
- Yes, sir. But this is different, sir.
- What?
I think it's one of ours, sir.
- That's impossible.
- Holographics are trying to confirm.
Contact them.
I want access codes.
We're trying, sir.
There's no response.
It's a trick. That's not one of ours,
it can't be.
That's a mechanical line.
No one can pilot mechanical.
- Forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.
- Thirty degrees, 80.
- Lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent.
- Sixty degrees.
- Shit! Come on, keep up!
- I'm trying!
Sir, holographic confirms.
It's the "Hammer", sir.
How can that be?
It's under attack, sustaining damage.
At its present velocity,
it'll reach Gate Three in 12 minutes.
Their EMP could take out every sentinel.
It'd take out more than that.
It'll wipe out our defense system.
We blow an EMP inside,
we lose the dock.
Sir, we already lost the dock.
Open the gate.
Gate Three is not responding!
We've taken critical damage, sir!
We've lost control!
We can't open it!
There's the exit.
On my mark, give me full power
Full power...
...ninety degrees.
Now!
Hold on, baby.
Goddamn, woman, you can drive.
We ain't home yet.
What about the gate?
Sentinels are inside the dock.
Are we too late?
- How many APUs are operational?
- Thirteen, sir.
Get me the one closest to Gate Three.
Reload!
He's pissing metal.
Go!
Go!
Heads up! They're coming around!
Behind you!
It's jammed!
Forget it, kid! Get out of here!
Got it!
Captain Mifune.
Oh, no.
They're coming.
They're coming.
The "Hammer".
What?
You have to open that gate.
Cut the counterweights.
You can do it.
Hurry. There's no time.
Captain...
...I didn't finish the training program.
Neither did I.
- Lock that down!
- Kill the feeder!
We won't make it.
We gotta blow the EMP now.
Come on, someone, please.
Keep the weight forward.
Light as a feather.
Holographic reports Captain Mifune's APU
is up and moving to Gate Three.
Don't over-squeeze the trigger.
Mifune's APU just reached Gate Three.
- How much time?
- Two minutes to impact.
- Captain Mifune, do you copy?
- I think his radio is down, sir.
Mifune...
...this is Lock.
I don't know if you can hear me,
but if you can...
... the "Hammer"'s two minutes away.
You've got two minutes, captain,
to get that gate open.
Link.
Get to the main deck!
Charge the EMP!
Do it, kid.
Neo. I believe.
- Yes!
- Can we make it?
We ain't come this far.
Almost home, almost home.
Burn it, Link!
- You did it.
- No.
We did it.
You're a hell of a pilot.
Some things in this world never change.
But some things do?
Luckily...
...some things do.
Link!
- Zee? Zee!
- Link!
I knew you'd come. I knew it.
I made a promise.
You did wear it.
Are you kidding?
I'm never gonna take it off.
Three captains, one ship.
I'll assume the other ships were lost
under equally pointless circumstances.
Good to see you too, Jason.
The Council's waiting to hear
an explanation.
Forgive me for not attending,
but I have to try to salvage this debacle.
Did I miss something?
I thought we saved the dock.
That's the problem with you people.
You can't think but five minutes
in front of you.
That EMP knocked out almost every piece
of hardware and every APU.
If I were the machines,
I'd send every sentinel here now.
Save the dock, captain?
You handed it to them on a silver platter.
Come on, get it cut.
The bridge is clear.
Do you hear that?
Get that cable run!
- I want the system back online!
- It's the dock. They've got incoming.
Order everyone to fall back.
Seal the shaft. Now.
Move it!
Oh, my God.
- All clear.
- Do it.
- Go! Come on! Run!
- Go!
Your move.
So you gave them your ship?
- That is correct, councillor, I did.
- Knowing what he planned to do with it?
The Oracle said nothing of this?
She told me Neo would need my help,
and I would choose to help him or not.
But what hope can a single vessel have
against their entire defense system?
None. It's completely impossible.
But he wouldn't listen.
He wouldn't even take any ammunition.
He was totally out of his goddamn mind.
No, he wasn't.
Neo is doing what he believes
he must do.
I don't know if what he's doing is right.
I don't know...
...if he'll reach the machine city.
And if he does, I don't know
what he can do to save us.
But I do know that as long as there is
a single breath in his body...
...he will not give up.
And neither can we.
Temperature's dropping.
Here we go.
We're over the fields, aren't we?
How do you know that?
I can feel them.
Over there.
There's our path. Can you see it?
Three lines.
Power lines.
Follow them.
What are they doing?
I don't know.
Lieutenant?
Goddamn it.
What do we do now?
It is now a matter of time.
The machines will breach
the walls of this city.
I recommend that the Council join the other
non-military personnel inside the temple.
How long do we have?
Two hours. Maybe less.
My men have fortified the entrance
with enough artillery to make our last stand.
Beyond that, there isn't anything more
I can do.
Commander, do you think that
we have any chance of surviving?
If I were you, I wouldn't
ask me that question.
I would ask him.
- Why?
- He's the one who believes in miracles.
There. Those mountains.
That's it.
- Do you see what's out there?
- Yes.
If you tell me we'll make it,
I'll believe you.
We'll make it.
We have to.
Sentinels.
There's too many!
Gotcha!
- I need help here!
- I can't beat them.
- What do we do?
- Go up, over them.
- What?
- The sky! It's the only way.
Then up we go.
Beautiful.
Pump the igniter. The ship will start.
Again. Slowly.
Now!
Trin?
Trinity?
Trinity?
- I'm here.
- Where?
Here.
We made it.
You said we would.
It's unbelievable, Trin.
Light everywhere.
Like the whole thing was built of light.
I wish you could see what I see.
You've already shown me so much.
What is it, Trinity?
What's wrong?
I can't go with you, Neo.
I've gone as far as I can.
What?
Oh, no.
Oh, no. No, no.
It's all right.
It's time.
I've done all that I could do.
Now you have to do the rest.
You have to finish it.
You have to save Zion.
I can't.
- Not without you.
- Yes, you can.
You will.
I believe it. I always have.
Trinity.
Trinity, you can't die.
You can't.
You can't.
Yes, I can.
You brought me back once.
But not this time.
Do you remember...
...on that roof, after you caught me...
...the last thing I said to you?
You said, "I'm sorry".
I wish I hadn't.
That was my last thought.
I wished I had one more chance...
...to say what really mattered.
To say how much I loved you.
How grateful I was for every moment
I was with you.
But by the time I knew how to say
what I wanted to, it was too late.
But you brought me back.
You gave me my wish.
One more chance to say
what I really wanted to say.
Kiss me.
Once more...
...kiss me.
Get that ammunition where it belongs!
You got one chance to get this right.
Get that damn thing mounted!
- Hurry.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Neo...
...if you're gonna do something,
do it quick.
I only ask to say
what I've come to say.
After that, do what you want,
and I won't try and stop you.
Speak.
The program Smith has grown
beyond your control.
He will spread through this city
as he spread through the Matrix.
You cannot stop him.
- But I can.
- We don't need you!
We need nothing!
If that's true, then I've made a mistake,
and you should kill me now.
What do you want?
Peace.
What are they doing?
What are you doing?
Morpheus!
And if you fail?
I won't.
Neo.
He fights for us.
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.
We missed you.
You like what I've done with the place?
It ends tonight.
I know it does. I've seen it.
That's why the rest of me
is just going to enjoy the show...
...because we already know
that I'm the one that beats you.
Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson...
...closing in on you?
Oh, I can.
I really should thank you for it.
After all, it was your life...
...that taught me the purpose of all life.
The purpose of life is to end.
Why, Mr. Anderson?
Why, why, why?
Why do you do it?
Why? Why get up?
Why keep fighting?
Do you believe you're fighting
for something?
For more than your survival?
Can you tell me what it is?
Do you even know?
Is it freedom or truth?
Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?
Illusions, Mr. Anderson.
Vagaries of perception.
Temporary constructs
of a feeble human intellect...
...trying desperately to justify an existence
that is without meaning or purpose!
And all of them as artificial
as the Matrix itself...
...although only a human mind could
invent something as insipid as love.
You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson.
You must know it by now.
You can't win.
It's pointless to keep fighting.
Why, Mr. Anderson, why?
Why do you persist?
Because I choose to.
This is my world! My world!
Wait.
I've seen this.
This is it. This is the end.
Yes. You were laying right there,
just like that.
And I...
I stand here, right here,
and I'm supposed to say something.
I say:
"Everything that has a beginning
has an end, Neo."
What? What did I just say?
No, no. This isn't right.
This can't be right.
Get away from me!
What are you afraid of?
It's a trick.
You were right, Smith.
You were always right.
It was inevitable.
Is it over?
Oh, no, no, no.
No, it's not fair.
It is done.
It doesn't make sense.
He did it.
He saved us.
He saved us.
It's over! He did it! He did it!
He did it! It's over!
It's over! He did it! He did it!
- What is it? What happened?
- Sir, he did it, sir. Neo, he did it.
- Did what?
- He ended the war.
The machines, they're gone.
The war is over, sir. The war is over.
Zion! Zion!
Zion, it's over!
It's over!
The war is over!
The war is over!
I have imagined this moment...
...for so long.
Is this real?
Neo, wherever you are...
...thank you.
Good morning.
Well, now. Ain't this a surprise.
You played a very dangerous game.
Change always is.
Just how long do you think
this peace is going to last?
As long as it can.
What about the others?
What others?
The ones that want out.
Obviously, they will be freed.
I have your word?
What do you think I am? Human?
Oracle!
We were afraid we might not find you.
Everything's okay now.
Look, look.
Just look at that.
Beautiful.
Did you do that?
For Neo.
That's nice.
I know he'd love it.
Will we ever see him again?
I suspect so.
Someday.
Did you always know?
Oh, no. No, I didn't.
But I believed.
I believed.
[suspenseful music playing]
[device beeping]
[phone line ringing]
- [woman] Seq, I'm in.
- [Seq] Captain.
[woman] You were right.
The skylight was a window pane.
[Seq] I've got
serious interference.
[woman] Weird.
It's some kind of Modal.
[Seq] Looks like old code.
[woman] It feels
really familiar.
[Seq] Drop a pin.
I'll signal for backup.
- [woman] I'm gonna
check it out.
- [Seq] Bugs?
If the general finds out
we've been fishing...
[Bugs] A quick peek can't hurt.
- [static]
- [Seq] Did you hear that?
Shit. I think
our signal was traced.
Bugs, this feels like a trap.
Bugs!
[suspenseful music playing]
[SWAT officer] Freeze!
Do not move!
We will shoot!
Very slowly, raise your hands.
[suspenseful music playing]
[lieutenant] Here we go.
Hey, where are you going?
You were warned, Lieutenant.
I think we can handle
one little girl.
You're wasting your time!
My men are bringing her
down now.
No, Lieutenant,
your men are already dead.
[gasps slowly]
Seq, you with me?
This old code keeps crashing.
Your projection's breaking up.
Switch to audio.
[Seq] Bugs,
this is a direct violation
of the general's protocols.
I know, I know.
But something is happening here.
Something important.
[Bugs] Oh, fuck.
We know what happens next.
She kicks their ass.
[all grunting]
[groans]
Now she makes a call.
[woman] The line was traced.
- And then...
- Then she runs for her life.
[woman] Are there any agents?
We know this story.
This is how it all began.
God damn it.
This is where he began.
You're thinking this Modal
is a loop? Or a treadmill?
Some sort of sequencer
evolving a program to do what?
I don't know.
But I'm going to find out.
All right.
[dramatic music playing]
[grunts]
[panting]
[woman grunts]
[woman groaning]
So deja vu and yet it's
obviously all wrong.
Why use old code
to mirror something new?
I don't know.
[all grunting]
[panting]
If that's supposed
to be Trinity,
that's not what happens.
Maybe this isn't the story
we think it is.
Bugs, you have
to get out of here.
- It's gotta be a trap.
- [helicopter whirring]
Shit.
[ominous music playing]
[Bugs grunting]
[Bugs growls]
[both grunting]
[Bugs screaming]
[agent screaming]
[both grunting]
[Bugs] Uh...
You all carry on.
As you were.
I'm just gonna...
see myself out.
Kill her.
[grunts]
[yells]
[sirens approaching]
[brakes screech]
[gasps]
[exclaims] Oh, Seq!
[tires screech]
[brakes screech]
[panting]
[gun cocks]
[Bugs straining]
[dramatic music builds]
- Why did you save me?
- You first.
Who are you?
Where did you come from?
Okay.
My name is Bugs.
As in "Bunny."
And tech that listens.
Do you know this is a Modal?
What's a Modal?
It's a simulation
used to evolve programs.
Do you understand
that you are...
digital sentience?
I know what I am.
Just like I know my job
is to hunt down
and destroy synthients.
Like you.
And yet...
Here we are.
Here we are.
The other agents
don't know about this room?
How'd you find it?
No one was ever in the key shop,
so I started looking.
More you looked,
the more you found.
Story of my life.
What?
I feel like I know this room.
Holy shit.
This is his apartment.
[gasps]
You mean Thomas Anderson's?
I searched everywhere.
He doesn't exist.
He stopped being Thomas
a long time ago,
but maybe you know him
by his real name.
Neo.
You do.
Oh, okay.
Uh...
I can't believe this,
after all these years.
You see, most people
think that Neo is dead.
But I know he's not.
Because I've seen him.
Where?
It's not something
I can explain easily, but...
But the moment he looked at me,
I felt something...
unlock my mind.
Okay.
Something like that
happened to me.
I saw this pattern...
and it was everywhere.
We can't see it,
but we're all trapped inside
these strange, repeating loops.
Somehow I saw it in the mirror.
Just a flicker,
but it was like you said.
And suddenly I understood.
This is not the real world.
[agent] For the first time,
I felt real purpose.
I knew who I was
and what I had to do.
Who are you?
What do you have to do?
I am...
Morpheus.
And I have to find Neo.
[Bugs gasping]
Morpheus.
Okay. Okay.
Oh, my God!
I have to get you out of here.
I need to figure out
who built this Modal.
Okay, come with me.
You have to be ready to leave.
You have to be really ready.
And if you're not,
if you think that
this is where you belong...
You call this a choice?
Oh, honestly, when somebody
offered me these things,
I went off on binary
conceptions of the world
and said there was no way
I was swallowing
some symbolic reduction
of my life.
And the woman
with the pills laughed
'cause I was missing the point.
What point?
The choice is an illusion.
You already know
what you have to do.
Truth.
Okay.
There's an old building
with a skylight
and lots of stairs.
The Lafayette.
One of the four back doors
leads there.
[Morpheus] Oh.
- Don't fight it.
- Whoa, what's happening?
Keep breathing.
Extraction works
pretty much the same
for humans and programs.
Ouch.
Ah.
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I've never worn
different glasses before.
Yeah, looks good. Which door?
- It's gotta be...
- Okay.
Agent White.
Agent Smith?
[laughs]
[Bugs grunts]
- [Bugs] Go!
- [grunts]
[men grunting]
Seq! Can you hear me?
Bugs! I thought I lost you.
Can you get us
to the window pane?
Bugs! Bugs! He's an agent!
[Morpheus exclaims, grunts]
That window! Go hard!
[both screaming]
[screaming fades]
[keyboard clacking]
[fast-paced music
playing on speakers]
- [computer buzzing]
- What the...
What the hell?
[suspenseful music playing]
Something wrong?
Uh... Just a little crash.
Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.
What a beautiful day
to be alive. Am I right?
- Problemo?
- He lost something.
Is this old Matrix code?
A little Modal experiment.
- For Binary?
- [cell phone chimes]
- I need a coffee.
- Coffee. Yes, stat!
I'm buying.
[man] I'm not trying to blow
smoke up your ass,
but the first time I played
the trilogy, I was shook.
The paradox
between free will and destiny.
Are we all just algorithms
doing what we're supposed to do
or can we escape
our programming?
Genius, inside the context
of the game, BT dubs.
Hey, did I tell you
it took over my life?
Yeah. I failed
the seventh grade. [chuckles]
Your game almost ruined me.
- So you've said.
- Yet here we are.
- [cups clink]
- You tell me, Mr. Anderson,
is it free will
or destiny?
Oh, yeah.
There she is.
Total f-ing MILF.
Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.
I'm a geek.
I was raised by machines.
Maybe you should go.
No, please.
I... I promise, best self.
Best self.
Sure.
You ever talk to her?
Tell you what.
For all you've done for me,
let me do this for you.
Jude, no. Stop.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Thanks.
Hi. Um...
I know this is all
a bit extemporaneous.
I'm Jude Gallagher.
I work for a game company
called Deus Machina.
Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.
Tiffany. Wow.
Didn't see that coming.
- Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.
- Jude.
Oh, and this is my very
good friend, Thomas Anderson.
He is a bona fide famous person
and considered by most to be
the greatest game designer
of our generation.
I'm sorry about this.
- Jude...
- [softly] Just talk to her.
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."
Hi.
Have we met?
Uh, we both come here.
- Can I have your morning bun?
- [boy] Hey!
Are you trying
to ball my mom or what?
- Brandon!
- [chuckles]
[boy 2] Can I have one bite?
Babe! What's going on?
We're gonna be late.
This is my husband, Chad.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.
Babe, we gotta get
Callie to practice.
Right. Sorry. [chuckles]
Come on, kids. Let's move out.
[soft music playing]
What?
[keyboard clacking]
[ominous music playing]
Sorry. Uh, it's the boss.
"Billions of people
just living out their lives...
oblivious."
I always loved that line.
You wrote that one, yeah?
Every time I stand here,
I mean, O-M-G.
It's so perfect,
it's gotta be fake.
- Right?
- [chuckles softly]
Yeah.
Sure.
Have a seat.
[man sighs]
Smoke?
I thought you quit.
I quit calling it a habit.
Now it's just a guilty pleasure.
Oh. Maybe I can make this
easy for you.
I know Binary is over budget.
This is not about Binary, Tom.
It's bigger than that.
This is about our future,
which is a sticky subject,
given our past.
What do you mean?
How's the therapy?
Good.
Any...
episodes?
No.
That's terrific.
Look, Tom, I know we've
always had our differences.
What did you say
about our first meeting?
We had all the chemistry
of an FBI interrogation.
[muffled yell]
[scoffs]
But look at this place.
We did this.
Together.
Yeah.
Now what?
Things have changed.
The market's tough.
I'm sure you can understand
why our beloved
parent company, Warner Bros.,
has decided to make
a sequel to the trilogy.
What?
They informed me they're gonna
do it with or without us.
I thought they couldn't do that.
[exhales]
Oh, they can.
And they made it clear
they'll kill our contract
if we don't cooperate.
Really?
I know you said the story
was over for you,
but that's the thing
about stories.
They never really end, do they?
We're still telling the same
stories we've always told,
just with different names,
different faces
and I have to say
I'm kind of excited.
After all these years,
to be going back
to where it all started.
Back to The Matrix.
I've spoken to Marketing...
- [sinister music playing]
- [distorted voice]
[in normal voice] Tom?
Yeah.
Are you all right?
[exhales nervously]
Yeah.
[analyst] What were you feeling
at that point?
What was I feeling?
I felt either I'm having
a mental breakdown again
or I'm living inside
a computer-generated reality
that has imprisoned me...
again.
[laughs]
[chuckles softly]
Not much of a choice.
No.
Maybe it's not
as binary as that.
Maybe there are other ways
to understand what happened.
Yeah.
Thomas, you are
a suicide survivor
gifted with
a powerful imagination.
Those facts have combined
to create dangerous fictions
in your life.
Yesterday,
you walked into a meeting
with your business partner
and he ambushed you,
demanding you make a game
you said you would never make.
This attack effectively
took away your voice.
His violence triggered you
and your mind fought back.
You did to him
what he was doing to you.
We've talked about the value
of adaptive anger
in healing trauma.
Far from suggesting a repeat
of your initial breakdown,
I believe this episode
demonstrates healthy
self-protection.
And more importantly,
I remember how hard
it was for you
to share something like this.
Which tells me
just how far we've come.
[chuckles softly]
Do you need a refill
on your prescription?
[sighs]
Yeah.
[pills rattle]
[mysterious music playing]
[grunts softly]
First of all, I know
I speak for everyone
when I say that
I'm so, so excited
to be working on a game
that was such a...
well, game changer.
Now, the packet in front of you
has our focus group research.
Inside, you'll find
the breakdown
including keyword association
with the brand.
The top two being
"originality" and "fresh,"
which I think are great things
to keep in mind
as you begin
working on Matrix 4.
And who knows how many more?
[alarm buzzing, stops]
[singing indistinctly]
What made Matrix different?
It effed with your head.
On point.
People want us
up in their grey space,
switching their synaptic
"WTF" light on.
["White Rabbit" playing]
[man laughing]
What made Matrix different?
It effed with your head.
People want us
up in their grey space,
switching their synaptic
"What the hell
is going on here?" light on.
[panting]
[shower running]
I didn't love the first one,
like some of you.
And, frankly,
I've got zero tolerance
for anything that requires
a syllabus and a highlighter.
I like my games big,
loud and dumb.
We need guns! Lots of guns.
Matrix means mayhem.
[grunting]
Mindless action is not on-brand.
[man] She's right.
Matrix is mind-porn.
Philosophy in shiny...
- tight PVC.
- Yeah.
Ideas are the new "sexy."
["White Rabbit"
continues playing]
Obviously The Matrix is about...
- trans-politics.
- Crypto-fascism.
It's a metaphor...
of capitalist exploitation.
This cannot be another reboot,
retread, regurgitated...
Why not? Reboots sell.
We are so far down the wrong
rabbit hole, here, people.
You say Matrix to anyone...
You say Matrix...
[echoing] Matrix...
Matrix... Matrix...
this is what they see.
[mimics explosion]
- [guns firing]
- [bullets whizzing]
[clicks tongue]
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.
Bullet time! Bullet time!
That's two words.
We need
a new "bullet time." [echoing]
[laughs maniacally]
We need to revolutionize
gaming again.
Revolutionize gaming
again! [echoing]
["White Rabbit" continues]
[barista] Afternoon, Tiff.
The ushe?
You know what, Skroce?
I'm going wild.
I'll have a cortado today.
Fly that freak flag.
Mind if I get that?
Oh, hi.
Hi.
[Tiffany] I remember
wanting a family,
but was that because
that's what women
are supposed to want?
How do you know
if you want something yourself
or if your upbringing
programmed you to want it?
Mmm.
I pay my analyst a lot of money
to answer such questions for me.
Smart.
I should get more therapy
but honestly,
I'm too goddamn tired.
Kids are exhausting, you know?
No. Never had kids.
Oh, right, I knew that.
- Sorry. I googled you.
- [chuckles]
So, what's it like being
a world-famous game designer?
- Must be amazing.
- Uh...
A lot of hours.
Sometimes it is amazing.
Most times...
I don't know.
But you made The Matrix.
Even I've heard of that.
Yeah. We kept
some kids entertained.
- So, worth it?
- [chuckles]
Can I ask something
about your game?
Sure.
Did you base your
main character on yourself?
There is a lot of me in him.
[indistinct shouting]
Maybe a little too much.
Can I ask you something else?
Please.
There's a woman in your game.
Trinity.
Which is a weird
coincidence also, right?
God, yeah.
I like her.
- I like Trinity.
- Ah.
And I dig her Ducati.
Another coincidence.
I love motorcycles.
[engine revs]
My friend Kush and I
actually build them.
Really?
You have your analyst,
I have my bikes.
So, I was looking at images
from your game. At Trinity.
Well, I showed Chad a scene,
and I was like,
"So, what do you think?"
He didn't get it until I said,
"Don't you think
she looks like me?"
You know what he did?
He laughed.
And I laughed too,
like it was a joke.
How could it not be, right?
Made me so angry.
I hated myself for laughing.
I wanted to kick him so hard.
Not too hard.
Maybe just hard enough
to break his jaw off.
[chuckles]
And right now,
you're probably regretting
sitting down with me.
This is the best thing
I've done in a long time.
[chuckles]
- [cell phone ringing]
- [gasps]
I have to take this.
Hi, this is Tiff.
Oh, God, no.
[gasps]
I'll be right there.
My, uh, youngest
stuck a Lego up his nose.
Oh.
I gotta go.
I hope I see you again.
[alarm blaring]
[announcer on speaker]
There has been a report
of an emergency.
Proceed calmly
to the nearest exit
and leave the building
immediately.
What's going on?
We probably just got swatted
by some 14-year-old.
Yeah, someone pissed
about the latest update.
Or they're just a dick.
Please move to the exits.
Building's being evacuated.
[cell phone buzzes]
[suspenseful music playing]
[security guard] Sir, this way.
Jude?
Jude!
At last.
[chuckles] Ah.
I wasn't too sure
about the callback,
but, you know,
it was hard to resist.
What?
Morpheus Uno.
Reveal at the window.
Lightning, thunder and theater.
At last.
All these years later,
here's me,
strolling out of a toilet stall.
Tragedy or farce?
I know you.
Not every day
you meet your maker.
This can't be happening.
Oh, most definitely is.
You can't be
a character I coded.
100% natural.
[gasps softly]
How?
All the explanation you need.
Oh.
No.
No, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, "no"?
You wanted this, you did this.
This was your idea.
[hesitating]
It was a test. An experiment.
An experiment?
You put me in a tiny-ass Modal,
left me to bang my head till
I nearly lost my shit
searching for you
as an experiment.
- The exit's breaking down.
- He hasn't taken the pill.
What? There's no time.
I know, I know.
He's having a moment.
Does he know how hard it was
to hack that mirror?
[tense music playing]
Still open.
This... This can't be real.
[SWAT officer] Target acquired.
We got him.
[grunting]
This isn't happening.
It's in my mind.
It's in my mind.
[SWAT officer 2] Hey, you!
Stop! Hold it!
[all screaming]
[groaning]
This can't be happening.
- [gunshots]
- [gasps]
[SWAT officer 3]
Freeze! Don't move!
[gun firing]
Neo!
[tense music playing]
[gun firing]
Oh, my God!
[distorted gunfire]
[men groaning]
[grunting]
[tense music continues]
Neo!
[tense music builds]
[shouts] Mr. Anderson!
No!
It can't be.
I've missed you.
[cat meows]
[bell tinkling]
It's in my mind.
It's in my mind.
[cup clinking]
[analyst]
Can you hear me, Thomas?
Follow my voice.
Feel the tips of your fingers.
What are they touching?
[bell tinkling]
The bell.
Do you hear the bell?
Do you remember what happened?
How you got here?
You must have walked.
I heard Deja Vu outside,
opened my door,
and there you were.
[Thomas Anderson exhales]
You feel like
you can talk about it?
When we started
working together,
you had lost your capacity
to discern reality from fiction.
You came to me after
trying to jump off a building.
You said you wanted to fly away.
[indistinct chatter]
[people shouting]
We have made
a lot of progress since then,
but you seem particularly
triggered right now.
Can you tell me how it started?
He texted me.
Who?
Morpheus.
Ah.
So, he's back.
It wasn't actually him.
It was a program
I coded for a Modal.
And this "Modal," Morpheus,
came to help you escape
from a virtual reality
called The Matrix.
Am I crazy?
We don't use that word in here.
What word should I use?
What word explains
what is happening to me?
Can I see the texts?
[exhales]
They were erased.
If we got in my car
and drove to your office,
what do you think
we'd find there?
Nothing.
Because there was no attack.
No one was killed.
No one texted.
My mind made it all up.
Is that what
I'm supposed to say?
Is that what you believe?
It felt real.
Of course.
It was your great ambition
to make a game
that was indistinguishable
from reality.
To achieve this goal,
you converted elements
of your life into narrative.
Your sublimated anger
toward your business partner
cast him as your nemesis.
A married woman named Tiffany
became the "Trinity"
of a doomed romance.
Even your dislike of my cat
made it into your Matrix.
There's nothing wrong with that.
It's what artists do.
But it becomes a problem
when fantasies
endanger us or other people.
We don't want anyone
to get hurt,
do we, Thomas?
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.
[Oracle] No one can tell you
you're in love.
You just know it,
through and through.
Balls to bones.
[Trinity whispers]
You feel this?
I'm never letting go.
[yells]
[both grunting]
[Morpheus] You have
to let it all go, Neo.
Free your mind.
[cell phone buzzing]
- [buzzing stops]
- [sighs]
[pigeon cooing]
Huh.
Looks easy enough.
[exhales]
"Free my mind." Shit.
[suspenseful music playing]
Okay.
Free my mind.
[grunts]
I fly...
or I fall.
[suspenseful music builds]
[grunts]
[both grunting]
Who the hell are you?
You won't remember me,
but a long time ago,
you changed my life
when you leapt off another roof.
Back then, I was just like
any other coppertop,
pretending my life...
until I looked up and I saw you.
It was a different you,
but I saw
the real you,
just a second before...
you leapt.
[people shouting]
And you never fell.
Are you the one
that hacked my Modal?
Yeah.
[cell phone buzzing]
That'll be Jude.
He's not your friend.
He's a handle,
a program used to control you.
He's on his way here,
and he's bringing
Agents with him.
Jude.
Bro, I've been calling you
all night.
We have a major problemo.
Are you alone?
That's kind
of a sexy question, dude.
[Bugs] They don't look like
typical Agents.
They use bots now,
skinned as normal people,
which means they're everywhere
and you never know who to trust.
Why should I trust you?
Because if they open
that door, we lose our hack.
I will be caught and killed
and you will be put right back
on that treadmill
they designed for you,
just like they did the last time
you tried to leap your way out.
I know why you left
your Modal open.
You needed someone else
to free Morpheus.
And it's because of him
that we were able
to get to you.
I know these things the same way
that I knew one day
I would find you.
And that when I did,
you would be ready for this.
If you want the truth, Neo,
you're going
to have to follow me.
Okay.
[dramatic music playing]
[upbeat music playing]
- Where are we?
- Tokyo.
A moving portal
makes it harder to track us.
- Seq is the best of them.
- [Seq] Portal's clean.
Reading our shadows.
I don't remember this.
We don't have to
run to phone booths
anymore, either.
[upbeat music playing]
Door's on your right.
[door opens]
Set and setting, right?
Oh, no.
It's all about set
and setting.
After our first contact
went so badly,
we thought elements
from your past
might help ease you
into the present.
Nothing comforts anxiety like
a little nostalgia.
This is footage from your game.
[Morpheus] Time is
always against us,
etcetera, etcetera.
No one can be told
what the Matrix is,
blah, blah, blah.
You gotta see it to believe it.
Time to fly.
[suspenseful music playing]
Wait.
If this is real,
if I haven't lost my mind,
does that mean
this happened?
[soft music playing]
But if it did...
then we died.
Obviously not.
Why the Machines kept you alive
and why they went
to such lengths to hide you
are questions
we don't have answers to.
Hide me?
I've been at a company making
a game called The Matrix.
Doesn't seem like they were
trying to hide anything.
We've been tracking
that company for years.
We screened every
Thomas Anderson we found.
What we didn't understand
was that they could
alter your DSI.
Pods generate
your digital self-image
through a feedback system
called Semblance.
This is how
you look to yourself.
Somehow they were able
to alter your DSI loop.
This is how
everyone else sees you.
[suspenseful music playing]
Twenty years?
Why did it take 20 years
to find me?
It took a lot longer than that.
It's been over 60 years
since you and Trinity
flew to one
of the Machine Cities.
What?
There's so much we don't know.
Like why you've barely aged,
or how many times
they've altered your DSI.
[Morpheus] But based on
what we do know,
it appears no one found you
because you didn't
want to be found.
- That's not true.
- [Morpheus] Maybe it isn't.
Maybe there's no foundation
to the rumors
that you disappeared,
because you were working
with the Machines
from the beginning.
Morpheus, stop.
All I'm saying is
this is the moment
for you to show us what is real.
If you want out,
you'll take this pill.
But if you are where you belong,
you can go back to this.
Every day.
Over and over forever.
Fuck.
[dramatic music playing]
[Seq] Keep the loop tight.
[Bugs] Cybebe needs
that tower pin.
I got a signal. It's faint.
It's definitely off-grid.
Captain. I'm tracking
a whole lot of weird.
- What?
- It's some kind of graft.
Thomas?
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
- We got company.
- How'd they find us?
Thomas, none of this is real.
You are in the midst
of a serious psychotic break.
- Lexy?
- Almost there.
Thomas?
Thomas, please.
This is not a game.
Feel my hand.
This is what is real.
Stay with me.
[Thomas Anderson] No. No.
[analyst, distorted]
Stay with me.
[distorted grunts]
Neo!
Morpheus!
[Morpheus] Let's go, let's go!
[people screaming]
[woman screaming]
- Bots are being activated.
- It's a swarm.
[grunting]
[yelling]
[woman screams]
[Bugs] Come on!
[Morpheus grunting]
[grunting]
[whimpers]
[shrieking]
I got a hack
in the bathroom. Hurry!
Yes.
Come on!
Seq, where?
- That mirror.
- What?
- We'll never fit.
- You gotta fit,
'cause I don't have
another way off this train.
- [groans]
- [Morpheus] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no.
Think "perspective."
Closer you are, bigger it gets.
Okay, come on.
In you go.
[suspenseful music builds]
[grunts]
[groaning]
[tense music builds]
[ominous music playing]
[haunting music playing]
[ominous music playing]
[metal clicking]
[grunts]
[yells, straining]
[groaning]
[whirring]
[screams]
[yelps, grunts]
[warbling]
[groaning]
[soft music playing]
[softly] Trinity.
No!
[suspenseful music playing]
[sentinels chittering]
[thunder crashing]
[dramatic music playing]
[electricity crackling]
[echoing] Welcome back
to the real world.
Trinity.
- What's up, Doc?
- [woman] His vital systems
have been
meticulously maintained,
but it doesn't look good.
[EKG beeping]
- We're losing him.
- Cold boot could shock him.
Do it.
[computer buzzing rapidly]
[groans]
[exhales]
I remember this.
The Construct.
In between everything
and nothing.
Welcome to the Crib.
I've been chilling here
in the ship network...
learning all about you.
[TV static]
And me.
Careful. It'll do your head in.
Are memories turned
into fiction any less real?
Is reality based in memory
nothing but fiction?
As to my role in all this,
my best guess
is that you wrote me
as an algorithmic reflection
of two forces
that helped you become you,
Morpheus and Agent Smith.
A combo pack
of counterprogramming
that was...
[inhales]
Let's just say, more than
a little bit crazy-making.
But it worked
because here we are.
Now, for the bad news.
Your brain
is hooked on this shit
the Matrix has been
force-feeding you for years.
Hooked bad.
You're going through
major withdrawals.
Docbots are giving you
crap odds for surviving.
But, see,
they don't know you like I do.
I know exactly what you need.
[lively music playing]
You gotta be kidding.
Uh-uh.
No joke.
Could be this is the first day
of the rest of your life.
But if you want it...
[water splashing]
you gotta fight for it.
No. I'm done fighting.
Are you?
[traditional battle
music playing]
[Neo grunting]
[groans]
[gasps]
[grunts]
[music resumes]
[groaning]
What the hell is he doing?
Oh, yeah. They taught you good.
[Neo grunting]
Made you believe their world
was all you deserved.
But some part of you knew
that was a lie.
Some part of you remembered
what was real.
You don't know me.
No?
[both grunting]
[groans]
Ooh.
[yelling]
[panting]
[Neo grunting]
[Morpheus grunting]
[both grunting]
I know you, because I know
the only thing
that still matters to you.
I know it's why you're here,
why you're still fighting
and why you will never give up.
[both grunting]
[Neo groaning]
- [whimpering]
- [EKG beeping]
Come on, Neo!
This is it.
This is your last chance.
[Neo groaning]
[emotional music playing]
[groaning]
You gotta fight
for your goddamn life
if you want to see
Trinity again.
[Neo groaning]
Come on, Neo! Fight for her!
- Holy shit.
- Fight for her!
[yelling]
[explosion]
[gasps]
[sighs]
- Hey.
- Hey.
Mind if I...
How are you doing?
If this plug is actually real,
that means they took my life...
[scoffs]
and turned it into a video game.
How am I doing?
I don't know.
I don't even know how to know.
That's it, isn't it?
If we don't know what's real...
we can't resist.
They took your story,
something that meant
so much to people like me,
and turned it
into something trivial.
That's what the Matrix does.
It weaponizes every idea.
Every dream.
Everything
that's important to us.
Where better to bury truth
than inside something
as ordinary as a video game?
That sounds like the Oracle.
[Bugs chuckles]
Heard so much about her.
She was gone before I was free.
Gone?
When this new version
of the Matrix was uploaded,
there was a purge.
[sighs]
They promised peace
and they gave us purge.
No.
No, there was peace.
You made it possible,
and it changed everything.
Doesn't feel like
it changed anything.
The Matrix is the same or worse.
And I'm back where I started.
It feels like everything I did,
everything we did...
[both grunt]
like none of it mattered.
All of it mattered.
I can show you.
This is my crew.
Our operator, Seq.
Sequoia. But everybody
calls me Seq.
Nice to meet you.
Dad loved redwoods.
When he escaped the Matrix
and found out
they no longer existed,
it almost killed him.
Lucky, he met Mom
and here I am.
This is Lexy, Berg and Ellster.
Hi.
You knew my grandfather,
Captain Roland.
Roland was your grandfather?
He always laughed,
joking how he never
believed in you.
But, in private, he said that
you freed his mind
a second time.
Uh, not to fanboy out here,
but this is kind
of a huge moment for me.
Berg is our resident
Neo-ologist.
A what?
There's a lot of people
out there like me
who are a little bit
obsessed with your life.
I would never have recognized
your Modal
if it weren't for him.
Whenever
you're feeling up for it,
I've got, like,
a million questions.
Me too. Starting with them.
[Bugs] It's okay.
Come meet him.
This is Cybebe.
That's Octacles.
- That's Lumin8.
- [chittering]
Machines are on our side now?
They are synthients.
It's a word
they prefer to "Machines."
Your contact
with the Synthient City
had a huge impact
on their world.
[Bugs] That's what I meant.
What you changed
that nobody believed
could ever be changed.
The meaning of "our side."
[Cybebe warbling softly]
Cybebe and Octacles
risked their lives
to help get you out.
Thank you.
But why?
[Morpheus]
Not all seek to control.
Just as not all wish to be free.
What is that?
An exomorphic-particle codex.
It's pretty new.
It gives programs
access to this world.
Within limits.
Limits are the domain
of the limited.
Morpheus.
Thank you.
It was my honor.
[chuckles] Wow.
- [crew chuckles]
- How does it work?
Paramagnetic oscillation.
If you want,
I can download
the codex manual for you.
- Sure.
- Downloading used to be fun.
Now it's all manuals
and diagnostics.
Can I ask them something?
When you unplugged me,
there was another pod?
[warbling softly]
Yes. We've analyzed the data.
It could be Trinity.
It's her.
I figured we were going
to have this conversation.
Look, you were not
a typical flush-and-grab.
You were in this weird tower
that Cybebe
had never accessed,
and she's now exiled.
We burned our one shot for you.
Even if it were Trinity
and she wanted to be free,
we have no idea how to do it.
Yet.
Nobody believed
we'd ever find him,
but we did.
Okay.
We don't know
how to get her out... yet.
Captain, we're approaching
security clearance.
We're here.
Zion?
Have a seat.
This is Hanno.
Best pilot in our fleet.
Quite a few synthients
deserve that title before me.
[Control on radio]
Mnemosyne, you are cleared
for landing. Welcome home.
[Hanno] Thank you, Control.
Um, we're about to crash.
[dramatic music playing]
[chuckles]
General realized we were
never going to beat
the Sentinels, so...
we just got better
at hiding from them.
Welcome to Io.
Io.
[sweeping music playing]
Wow. That looks real.
Bio-sky.
Works kind of like grow lights.
It's way more complex than that.
It pulls water from the crust,
hydronating the air.
It balances the ECO
and our SRI cycles.
Plus... [sighs]
it is pretty to look at.
As opposed to that.
I guess the general sent us
a welcome party.
God damn.
It is you.
Niobe?
A few more wrinkles
and a few less teeth,
but wise enough to know
I don't know anything.
I sure as shit
never saw this coming.
Neither did I.
I told you he was alive.
Captain, you and your crew
have been grounded.
General,
if you'd just let me explain.
The protocols are put in place
for everyone's protection.
I'm sorry. I saw an opportunity
and I was afraid we'd lose him.
But, General, people have been
waiting for so long.
We found The One.
I don't believe in The One.
I never did.
No?
Me neither.
But there was a time
when you trusted me
with your ship,
against the Council's orders.
The world was different then.
We were different.
Report to the docks.
Scrub down the Mnemosyne.
Transfer your access codes.
You are done, Captain.
[gasps softly]
We need to talk.
[Niobe] When word first came
that it actually might be you...
I didn't know how I would feel
in this moment.
It is nice to see you.
- It's good to see you too.
- [glasses clink]
A long way
from Dozer's paint stripper.
[chuckles] Yes.
A lot has changed.
Except maybe you.
You remember this?
It's so easy to forget
how much noise
the Matrix pumps into your head
until you unplug.
[Neo sighs]
Yeah.
Something else
makes the same kind of noise.
Takes over every damn thing,
just like the Matrix.
War.
I stood at the barricade
of the Temple.
Staring
at the army of Sentinels,
waiting for them
to kill every one of us.
But then, they left.
They said you saved us.
I didn't believe it.
Every night I would dream
of attack sirens.
But then,
I would wake up to this...
silence.
I'm ashamed of it now.
My pessimism of how long
it took me to believe
a world without war
was possible.
You gave me that.
You gave that gift to us all.
And it is the gift
that continues to bear fruit.
Come help me get up.
Let's take a walk.
[mysterious music playing]
[elevator door opens]
Oh! Beautiful.
This is Freya, head of botany.
And this is Quillion,
our lead digitologist.
I presume our guest
needs no introduction.
Nothing travels
faster than light,
except gossip.
[Freya chuckles]
Welcome to the Garden, Neo.
A strawberry?
Using digital code
from the Matrix,
we retro-convert it
into DNA sequences.
And they grow here?
It's not easy
augmenting the genome
to photosynthesize
Bio-sky, but...
- We're getting there.
- [chuckles]
Go ahead. Try it.
[Niobe chuckles]
We're quite excited
about the blueberries.
You remember that shit
we used to eat?
That slop that tasted like rust.
Zion could have never
made something like this.
Why?
Because we needed synthients
and DI like him.
Zion was stuck in the past.
Stuck in war.
Stuck in a Matrix of its own.
They believed
that it had to be us or them.
This city was built by us
and them.
What happened to Zion?
I've been waiting
for you to ask that question.
All of the troubles
started in the Machine Cities.
Power plants were unable
to produce enough energy.
Nothing can breed violence
like scarcity.
For the first time,
we saw machines at war
with one other.
We got word from the Oracle
of a new power rising.
That was the last
we heard from her.
Morpheus.
[Niobe] After the siege,
he was elected unanimously.
High Chair of the Council.
Oh, how he loved that. [scoffs]
But as rumors
of this new power spread,
he ignored them.
He was certain what you had
done could not be undone.
All of these people never
stopped believing in miracles,
believing in you.
I'm sorry.
How could I know
this would happen?
We didn't understand
all of it back then.
No more than we do now.
I didn't come here
to cause you problems, Niobe,
but I need your help.
Trinity is alive.
Then there is another question.
Why did they keep her alive?
I can't answer that.
But if there's a chance
I can free her,
I have to try.
Even if it means endangering
everyone in this city?
I'm sorry, Neo.
I won't let what happened
to Zion happen to Io.
I hope you'll forgive
an old woman
for asking you to go
with Sheperd, here,
till we have
better understanding
of what's going on.
You're going to imprison me
after I just got free?
I know it doesn't seem fair,
but neither does growing old.
But you don't
hear me complaining.
[elevator whirring]
Sorry.
I've never met a legend before.
Neo.
Sheperd. [breathes shakily]
[chuckles in disbelief]
Crazy. You're real.
"Real."
There's that word again.
[Sheperd] People talk a lot
about the old days.
About you, the viral Agent.
The siege of Zion.
Everything was simpler
back then.
People wanted to be free.
It's different now.
Sometimes it feels like
people gave up.
Like the Matrix won.
[unlocks door]
This is you.
And I gotta ask you one thing.
Is it true you could fly?
Cool.
[locks door]
[trickling]
[Morpheus grunts]
Morpheus.
Oh. General stuck you
in the Rapunzel tower.
[Morpheus exhales]
On the upside, it's a nice view.
What happened to Bugs
and the others?
They're supposed to be
sterilizing the Mnemosyne
- with a toothbrush.
- "Supposed to be"?
Well, I could tell you
that they're standing by,
waiting for you
to make the choice
to remain meekly incarcerated
or bust the hell out of here
and go and find Trinity.
But that ain't a choice.
[dramatic music playing]
[Sheperd] General,
what should we do?
[Freya] Bugs has the same
independence of mind
she had the day you freed her.
This is not
independence of mind.
It's mutiny.
[Freya] Come on, 'Be.
I know how much
you hated locking him up.
Just like I know
there's a part of you
that's relieved now
that he's gone.
We've worked so hard
to keep Io safe.
This scares me.
That's her.
[Seq] On the bridge.
Got her.
[engine revving]
It's sick
how the Semblance works.
You see flashes
of the real her, but...
the way she reads...
Code-wise, she's pure bluepill.
This is a tough question, Neo,
but it has to be asked.
What if she's happy
where she is?
How did I read?
Exactly like her.
Take us to broadcast depth.
[suspenseful music playing]
Thank you for helping me.
Most of us are here
because of you.
I also admit our only chance
to get out
of the general's doghouse
is for you to find your mojo.
What if I can't be
what I once was?
- Then we're all fucked.
- [signal beeps]
[Hanno] Two minutes.
Two minutes to broadcast.
[Seq] I slipped you in
through a hotel room.
[Seq chuckles]
Should be safe.
Portal's open.
Closest I could get you is
the warehouse near her garage.
Whole zone's crawling with bots.
Let's go.
So, what do you think of him?
I was kinda worried at first
because he's so much older.
The beard, the hair... Oh.
- No, totally works for me.
- [scoffs] You idiot.
I mean "The One" thing.
You know, everyone that
shipped with him died.
Oh, yeah. He's gonna
get us all killed, for sure.
[guns cocking]
Predictable as ever.
Smith.
Smith? As in, "the" Smith?
[chuckles]
This is so insane.
There's so many theories
about the two of them
and they're standing
right there.
This code is freaky!
He's like an Agent, but not.
An appeal to reason.
How did you find us?
You never appreciated
our relationship.
Not like The Analyst.
- The what?
- My doctor.
He used our bond
and turned it into a chain.
It's so obvious
once you see it, right?
But this whole altered-code
update really blew my mind.
I still don't know
how he did it.
You, as a balding nerd.
Hilarious.
And me... [sighs]
even more perfect.
Maybe a little too far
on the piercing blue eyes.
What do you think?
What do you want, Smith?
I have such dreams, Tom.
Big dreams.
Well, mostly just extremely
violent revenge fantasies,
but in order for me
to pursue mine,
I need to dissuade you
from pursuing yours.
Hmm. Sounds like conflict.
Inevitable?
Doesn't have to be.
All you have to do
is stay out of the Matrix,
and leave the good doctor to me.
You can have him.
I'm here for Trinity.
That's the trouble, Tom.
He knew you'd come,
just like I did.
[scoffs]
Trust me.
You're not ready for him.
Captain, I'm reading portals
from the lower frequencies.
I won't have his leash
on my neck again.
I found some
old acquaintances of yours.
- Bugs!
- [growling]
[ominous music playing]
[snarls]
Exiles.
I thought they were all purged.
[man] You?
[excitedly] Oh!
It is you!
[man speaking French]
All these years.
I can't believe it.
Oh, God.
You stole my life!
[speaking French]
[in English] What the Merv
is trying to say,
is that their situation
is a little bit like mine.
To have their lives back,
yours has to end.
[bullet whizzing]
Kill him!
[tense music playing]
[blade slicing]
[all grunting]
You ruined
every suck-my-silky-ass thing!
We had grace.
We had style!
We had conversation!
Not this...
[mimics text message sound]
[all grunting]
- [bone cracks]
- [yells]
Art, films,
books were all better!
Originality mattered!
You gave us Face-Zucker-suck
and Cock-me-climatey-
Wiki-piss-and-shit!
[screams]
[screaming]
[ominous music builds]
[man groans]
I still know kung fu.
Neo!
[Smith yells]
[both grunting]
Just like old times.
[tense music playing]
[Neo groaning]
[woman shrieks]
[man yelling]
Neo.
I've been thinking
about us, Tom.
Look how binary is the form,
the nature of things.
Ones and zeros.
[grunting]
Light and dark.
Choice and its absence.
[Smith grunts]
Anderson and Smith.
[dramatic music playing]
[gasps]
You've lost something, Tom.
You're not what you used to be.
It's true.
[grunts]
[jaw cracks]
- Nice one.
- Thanks.
Come on, Neo.
[Neo groaning]
[panting]
[gasps]
Captain. You okay?
Yeah. Where's Neo?
Smith is killing him.
[Bugs] Where?
[Neo groaning]
I feel bad about this, Tom.
After all, you are the one
who set me free...
again.
So, you, more than anyone,
understands why I can't go back.
[grunts]
You should have listened to me.
Now you'll never see her again.
[grunts]
[yells]
[energy explodes]
What was that?
That was Neo.
Mojo rising.
[Lumin8 chittering]
[Seq exclaims]
[Bugs] You all right?
Yeah.
It's gonna trigger a response.
I got multiple exits ready.
[The Merovingian]
This is not over yet!
Our sequel franchise spinoff!
[speaking French]
[spits]
[Bugs] We should go.
I can't.
I have to talk to her.
Neo, those Exiles
were older than you,
and we barely handled them.
[sighs]
You really wanna do this now?
I mean...
you look like shit.
[buzzing]
Oh, my God. What? What happened?
An accident.
[Tiffany] Kush! Call a doctor.
It's fine.
I don't have a lot of time.
I wasn't sure I'd see you again.
After we spoke, I realized...
my life wasn't a life.
At some point, I think I gave up
searching for something real.
Wait.
Something happened.
I looked for you
at the coffee shop.
I began to wonder
if I imagined you.
And then last night
I had a dream.
In the dream, you were
surrounded by police,
then they started chasing us.
- Us?
- You were on my bike with me.
How did it end?
Not good.
I've had dreams
that weren't just dreams.
You mean a dream that came true?
[bell tinkling]
[suspenseful music playing]
Finally, we can talk
like adults.
I hate lying. I do.
It exhausts me.
Tiff and I have been
waiting for you...
like, forever.
[distorted rewinding]
Deja vu, right?
Oh, no use. You can't beat time.
This rewind is happening
faster than you can blink.
You gave me the idea.
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.
"Bullet time."
[grunts in slow motion]
I know. Kind of ironic,
using the power
that defined you
to control you. [chuckles]
I kept such a close eye on you
and still you found a way out.
Clever monkey, using that Modal.
Call me an optimist,
but this could
all be for the best.
The skin's not looking
too bad this time.
I know some of this will be
difficult for you to hear,
after everything
you went through.
All that pain and suffering,
only to learn the world
doesn't end when you do.
Surprise.
[Neo grunts]
I was there when you died.
[Neo screaming]
I said to myself,
"Here is the anomaly
of anomalies."
What an extraordinary
opportunity.
First, I had to convince
the Suits
to let me rebuild
the two of you.
Why her? Getting there.
And don't worry,
she can't hear me.
Resurrecting you both
was crazy expensive.
Like renovating a house.
Took twice as long,
cost twice as much.
[gasps]
I thought you'd be happy
to be alive again.
So wrong.
- [machine whirring]
- [screaming]
Did you know hope and despair
are nearly identical in code?
[screaming]
We worked for years,
trying to activate
your source code.
I was about to give up,
when I realized...
Trinity.
It was never just you.
Alone, neither of you
is of any particular value.
[Trinity screaming]
Like acids and bases,
you're dangerous
when mixed together.
Every sim
where you two bonded...
Let's just say
bad things happened.
Neo!
However, as long as I managed
to keep you close,
but not too close,
I discovered
something incredible.
Now, my predecessor
loved precision.
His Matrix was all fussy facts
and equations.
He hated the human mind.
So he never bothered to realize
that you don't give a shit
about facts.
It's all about fiction.
The only world that matters
is the one in here.
And you people
believe the craziest shit.
Why?
What validates
and makes your fictions real?
Feelings.
Allow me.
Kush, here,
is one of my handlers.
They're everywhere.
Such a pain, cloning Agents
over a coppertop.
Far more effective
just to saturate a population.
And, bonus,
swarm mode is sick fun.
[chuckles]
[gun fires in slow motion]
Ooh! Nicely done.
You ever wonder
why you have nightmares?
Why your own brain tortures you?
It's actually us,
maximizing your output.
It works just like this.
Oh, no! Can you stop the bullet?
If only you could move faster.
[chuckles] Here's the thing
about feelings.
They're so much easier
to control than facts.
Turns out, in my Matrix,
the worse we treat you,
the more we manipulate you,
the more energy you produce.
It's nuts. [chomps]
I've been setting
productivity records
every year since I took over.
And, the best part,
zero resistance.
People stay in their pods,
happier than pigs in shit.
The key to it all?
You.
And her.
Quietly yearning
for what you don't have,
while dreading
losing what you do.
For 99.9% of your race,
that is the definition
of reality.
Desire and fear, baby.
Just give the people
what they want, right?
[squelches]
She's the only home
you have, Thomas.
Come home before
something terrible happens.
[tense music playing]
[Neo grunts]
[keyboard clacking]
- Bugs!
- I hear him.
- [sirens approaching]
- [tires screech]
Trinity!
- You shouldn't call me that.
- I'm sorry.
I have to go.
But I'll be back.
Neo! Time to go.
- [gasps]
- [alarm blaring]
- Sentinels?
- Worse.
[Sheperd on radio]
General ordered me
to look after the ship.
So you shadowed us?
Check your long-range scans.
Squids are combing this area.
He's right.
You can stay here and die,
or come back
and face a court-martial.
And you call that a choice?
[Niobe] Sheperd should have
left you to the Squids.
I'm too damn old to sit
through some boring-ass trial.
Niobe, don't blame Bugs.
Do shut your mouth.
Do address me as General.
And do not rob
my ex-captain of her agency,
which she exercised with her own
particular brand
of shortsighted stupidity.
Shortsighted?
You care more
about growing fruit
than freeing minds.
We are not going
to have this argument again.
It's not an argument.
It's a fact.
You gave up on people.
I tell you
what I'm going to give up on
and it's you!
Sheperd, get her
out of my sight!
General...
Disarm!
Kujaku's a friend.
[Kujaku warbling]
Hello, friend.
[chittering softly]
Okay.
Him?
General.
Thank you for seeing me.
I figured if there was anyone
who could make sense
of this mess,
it would be you.
Hello, Neo.
I know you.
I tried to keep my eye on you.
[clicks tongue]
Why?
We met a long time ago.
Good morning.
Sati.
My father knew we'd meet again,
though he would have wished
for happier circumstances.
His inadvertent role
in what happened to you
was the greatest regret
of his life.
I don't understand.
My father was the chief engineer
at the Anomaleum.
[Niobe] The what?
My father designed
the resurrection pods
where Neo and Trinity
were imprisoned.
[Niobe] I'm sorry.
You knew what happened to him?
You knew that he and Trinity
both were alive...
and you didn't tell me?
There were times
I doubted my decision, Niobe.
But Io needed you.
This city needed to be built
for your people as well as mine.
If I would have
told you everything,
you would have had a very
difficult choice to make.
My friends
let me make my own choices.
If it was a mistake,
you have my deepest apologies.
Why are you here now?
Neo's escape has
destabilized the Matrix.
The Anomaleum draws its current
from Trinity alone now.
A fail-safe has been
triggered to reset
the Matrix back
to the previous version.
But The Analyst
halted the reset.
He's convinced the authorities
that you will soon
return voluntarily.
And why would he say that?
Because if I don't go back,
he'll kill Trinity.
Faced with returning to your pod
or enduring
Trinity's death again.
What would you choose, Neo?
I'll go back.
Well, The Analyst
knows you well,
but that knowledge
has made him incautious.
After you escaped,
he should have
accepted his losses
and devacuated Trinity.
But that would have prevented
this extraordinary opportunity
that now exists before us.
A few hours ago,
no one would have been able
to convince me
that I would be standing here,
trying to explain a mission
as crazy as this one.
What are you doing?
- Volunteering.
- Oh, no.
You are the one captain
that I am ordering to go.
Now you don't
have to order me, General,
'cause I'm volunteering.
I need two more.
Are you out of your minds?
You don't even know what it is.
General, we know you.
If you say this is important,
none of us is
choosing to stay home.
Thank you.
Knuckle up, and good luck.
[dramatic music playing]
[Kujaku chittering]
[Sati] Trinity is held
in the Anomaleum,
which is in this
transmission tower.
The passages used
to rescue Neo are now sealed
and a legion of Sentinels
patrols the tower.
So, stealth will be paramount.
As long as we raise no alarms,
this first part of the mission
should be the easiest.
You mean
crossing the Fetus Fields,
sneaking across
an entire power plant,
climbing a two-kilometer tower
guarded by thousands
of Sentinels?
That's the easy part?
Exactly so.
Because all we have to do
is convince someone
who does this every day
to take one of us along.
- [electricity crackling]
- [dramatic music continues]
Fifty meters below the Anomaleum
is a stratum
of amniotic filters.
Hidden along this edge
is a small hexagonal vent.
This vent feeds the air intake
into the corpuscular modifier,
which oxygenates
the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.
I get it.
The exomorph slinkies up
Neo's old umbilicus.
What could go wrong?
[tense music playing]
[grunts]
[straining]
[Sati] Once inside,
Morpheus will use
the System Operator
to open the devacuator line
and disengage the macerators.
[machinery clanking]
In order to unplug
Trinity's body,
while her mind still remains
connected to the Matrix,
I'm gonna need
a second human brain
to implement the bypass.
And since Neo
must be with The Analyst,
the only available mind
that's a near-enough match
is yours.
Figures.
[tense music playing]
Thanks, Cybebe.
[grunts]
Does Trinity still have
to take the red pill?
Since Kujaku and I
are transferring
her consciousness onto the ship,
it's not strictly necessary.
But what matters is that
this is her choice.
Extracting a confused
or an uncertain mind will,
in all probability, kill her.
But even if it is
what she wants,
won't The Analyst just order
the Sentinels to stop you?
He will.
But if my plan works,
it won't matter.
Why?
Because we'll already be gone.
Somebody thinks
this hard about a plan,
there has to be a reason why.
When my father realized
how the Anomaleum
was going to be used,
he covertly transferred
the designs to me.
The Analyst
discovered his betrayal
and had my parents purged.
[inhales sharply]
I would have been murdered too
if it wasn't for Kujaku.
Not a day goes by
that I don't grieve them.
I've been praying for this day
for a very long time.
[door unlocks, opens]
We're coming up on broadcast.
I thought you should know
that I'm here because of her.
All I ever wanted was to be
as fearless as Trinity.
But I saw how she reacted
in the garage, and I...
You're wondering if I'm wrong.
What if we're too late?
What if she's not
Trinity anymore?
[sighs]
I never believed I was The One.
But she did.
She believed in me.
It's my turn to believe in her.
[sighs]
[suspenseful music playing]
[Sati] This is
where it gets tricky.
Have you ever done
an operation like this?
Not yet.
[suspenseful music builds]
Here we go.
[suspenseful music continues]
Welcome home.
All I want is to talk to her.
Do you mean Tiff?
Come back,
and you can talk to her
as often as you like.
I mean, handsome Chad
may have something
to say about it.
If she tells me
this is what she wants,
you win.
Really?
But if she wants me,
then you'll let us go free.
And why would I do something
as stupid as that?
Right now,
I'm on a ship full of people
who will unplug me
before they'll let you
take me back.
If you want this Matrix,
this is your only chance.
But how do I know
they won't unplug you anyway?
Same way I know you'll let us
walk out of here.
[suspenseful music playing]
Okay.
I like tests.
We'll let Tiff decide.
[electricity crackling]
[Sati breathing heavily]
That's it.
Bypass is ready.
Now what?
We wait.
Doesn't it seem crazy
to come all this way
and leave her here?
We must abide by her decision.
And if she says no,
what happens to Neo?
At this time,
the most important choice
of Neo's life
is not his to make.
[slow suspenseful music playing]
I saw this in my dream.
If I was the Oracle,
maybe I could explain it.
The Oracle.
From your game?
It's not a game.
Oh, God.
[Tiffany sighs]
After you left, I went home
and I played it.
I kept thinking,
why does this story
feel like a memory?
There's a part of me
that feels like
I have been waiting
my whole life for you.
And that part is like,
"What the hell
took you so long?" [sniffles]
I don't have an easy answer.
Maybe I was afraid of this.
Afraid of what might happen.
Afraid of hurting
the only person I ever loved.
I wish I was who you think I am.
But look at me.
I can't be her.
- [Donnie] Mom!
- [Brandon] Mom! Come on.
- Mom!
- It's Callie.
Is this real?
[Donnie]
You have to come with us.
[Brandon] Come on, we gotta go.
Tiff, hey. Don't know
what's going on here,
but I'm glad we found you.
- She got hit by a car!
- I know, it's crazy.
She was chasing after you.
They're casting her arm.
We gotta go.
[Chad] Doctor said
she's gonna be fine.
[Donnie] You have to come
with us to the hospital.
It's too late.
I understand.
- Tiff, come on, let's go.
- [Donnie] Come on.
What's happening?
Neo was wrong.
[somber music playing]
Tiffany.
Tiffany, you have
to come with us.
Tiffany! [echoing]
I wish you would
fucking stop calling me that.
I hate that name.
My name is Trinity
and you better
take your hands off of me.
[Trinity grunting]
Neo!
Trinity!
Oh, shit.
Get her out. Get her out!
[grunts, yells]
Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.
I own that mistake.
Shouldn't have pressed.
Women used to be
so easy to control.
You know there's no way
I can let you two go free.
Cannot happen.
So, I guess it's deja vu
all over again.
She dies
and it's all your fault.
Lies, lies and more lies.
Smith?
What has the world come to
when you can't even
trust a program?
- How...
- [gun clatters]
Tom and I have more in common
than you know.
Once he got out, let's just say,
I was free to be me.
[grunts]
- Yeah!
- Trinity?
[tense music playing]
[bell tinkling]
[all grunting]
[Trinity groaning]
[breathes shakily]
You ready?
Yeah.
[Bugs groans, yells]
[bell tinkling]
[cat yowls]
[grunting]
[distorted screaming]
[yells]
- [Sati grunts]
- [screaming]
[screaming]
Oh, no.
Destroy her. Destroy her!
No.
[Neo and Trinity straining]
Stop them.
[both yelling]
[explosion]
You think this is over?
Lockdown. Initiate swarm.
Here, our unexpected
alliance ends.
You know the difference
between us, Tom?
Anyone could have been you.
Whereas I've always been anyone.
[grunting]
What just happened?
What?
- [alarm blaring]
- Oh, no! Move! Move!
Get the hell out of there!
[tense music playing]
- How bad?
- Like, all the bad.
Yeah, this is bad.
I don't suppose
you can still fly?
[grunting]
Yeah, that's not happening.
[ominous music playing]
[all screaming]
Neo! Get on.
[engine revving]
Calliope! Take the wounded!
Everyone else,
we stay with them!
- How is she?
- Life signs are good.
Her signal's strong, Captain.
[Kujaku squawks]
Well done, Captain.
All we need is a miracle.
[tense music playing]
[siren wailing]
[Neo grunts]
[tires screech]
I hate bots.
- Get us out of here!
- I'm trying!
The lockdown is tracking.
Swarm is everywhere.
Never seen anything like this.
[grunts]
[siren wailing]
[tense music playing]
[engine revving]
Seq, what is that?
What's wrong?
What are you... [screams]
[grunts]
He's turning bots into bombs.
[glass shattering]
[bodies thudding]
[tires screeching]
[tires screeching]
Shit! [grunts]
Lexy?
[gunfire]
- [tires screeching]
- [tram bell ringing]
Sheperd's in trouble.
[Lexy grunting]
Jack me in.
I can get you in.
I don't know
if I can get you out.
- No!
- [tires screeching]
[motorcycle revving]
What are they doing?
Herding them into a kill zone.
[both groaning]
[Neo groaning]
Captain, you gotta hurry.
- [Lexy groaning]
- Hang on, Lex.
[Lexy screaming]
- Lexy!
- [grunting]
[tense music playing]
[SWAT officer] There they are!
[Neo straining]
[all grunting]
Morpheus!
Lex.
- Bugsy.
- Hell yeah!
Seq, where's Neo?
It's bad. They're pinned.
Heading to a roof.
[dramatic music playing]
[Neo grunting]
[Neo yelling, grunts loudly]
[both grunting]
[machine beeping rapidly]
Nodal fibrillation is critical.
She'll die if we don't extract.
[soft dramatic music playing]
[inhales deeply]
[exhales]
It's so beautiful.
I remember this.
I remember us.
My dream ended here.
We can't go back.
We won't.
[evocative music playing]
Can they make the jump?
[music stops]
[slow evocative music playing]
[grunting]
I'm not doing this.
Are you doing this?
[dramatic music playing]
[helicopter hovering]
Bye.
[soft music playing]
- [bell tinkling]
- [meows]
[crumbling in distance]
[suspenseful music playing]
How dramatic.
"Tiffany"?
[chuckles]
It was a private joke.
An amusement, that's all.
An amusement? Hmm.
[flesh tears]
- [softly] Whoa.
- [groaning]
Kind of like that?
[chokes]
[gulps]
Okay. Ow.
If you hated the name so much,
why did you heel like
a good little bitch so long?
- [Trinity grunts]
- [blade slices]
[body thuds]
Yeah. Definitely asked for that.
- [snaps fingers]
- [The Analyst groaning]
[shudders]
Can't you control her?
[groaning]
That was for using children.
We have a few questions.
You tried to activate
the fail-safe.
The Suits tried.
Obviously, without control
of your source code,
I knew that was impossible.
So, why haven't
the Suits purged you?
Because I know the system.
I know human beings.
And I know you.
[bones crack, sighs]
Right now, you're feeling good
about what you've done.
You should.
It was a victory. Bravo.
Now what?
You've come here to negotiate
some kind of deal?
You think you hold
all the cards,
because you can do
whatever you want
in this world.
I say, go for it.
Remake it. Knock yourselves out.
Paint the sky with rainbows.
But here's the thing.
The sheeple aren't
going anywhere.
They like my world.
They don't want
this sentimentality.
They don't want
freedom or empowerment.
They want to be controlled.
They crave
the comfort of certainty.
And that means you two,
back in your pods,
unconscious and alone,
just like them.
[both chuckle]
We're not here
to negotiate anything.
We were on our way
to remake your world.
Change a few things.
I kind of like
the "paint the sky
with rainbows" idea.
Just remind people
what a free mind can do.
I forgot. It's easy to forget.
- He makes it easy.
- That, he does.
Something he should think about.
Before we got started,
we decided to stop by
to say thank you.
You gave us something
we never thought we could have.
And what is that?
Another chance.
[punk rock music playing]
Face reality, people.
Movies are dead.
Games are dead.
Narrative? Dead.
Media is nothing
but neuro-trigger response
and viral conditioning.
Wait, what are you two
talking about?
Cat videos.
What we need is
a series of videos
that we call "The Catrix."
