Abstract

This report focuses on the evolution of dark matter particles in a simplied, homogeneous
and isotropic model of the Universe. The purpose is to analyze theoretical predictions and
recent experimental measurements to be able to draw conclusions about the properties
of the dark matter particles. The inexperienced reader is introduced to the subject and
thorough derivations of the formulas relevant to the analysis are made. To analyze the
evolution of dark matter, the Boltzmann equation is applied to a freeze-out model. Both
analytical and numerical approaches will be taken and discrepancies between those are
investigated. Qualitative eects of the particle cross section and mass are studied and
constraints on the parameters are set using experimental data. Finally, assumptions are
discussed and suggestions for further research are made.

Introduction

Ever since the early times of mankind, we have looked up at the night sky and tried to
make sense of the apparent motion of the celestial bodies. The image of ourselves at the
center of the Universe was shattered when Nicolaus Copernicus introduced the concept
of heliocentrism [1]. From that time onward, it became increasingly clear that we are a
very small part of an enormous universe.

Since then, our quest to describe the Universe has taken us past Johannes Kepler's
laws for the elliptical orbits in the Solar System to Isaac Newton's theory of gravity
which enables us to calculate the motions of many astronomical objects with great ac-
curacy. However, events which were inexplicable by the prevailing theories of the time
accumulated as more observations were made. In this situation, the natural question was
whether these observations indicated faults in the theory itself or merely shortcomings
in our ability to observe the Universe.

With the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, this question was
partly resolved as it describes the eect of gravity on time and space more accurately
than before. General relativity together with the standard model of particle physics,
developed throughout the twentieth century, is able to a describe a major part of the
peculiarities our Universe exhibits.

Once again deviations from the expected results were observed when the Dutch as-
tronomer Jan Oort studied the orbital velocities of stars in the Milky Way. He concluded
that there had to be more matter in the galaxy than could be detected through direct
methods. This missing matter was named dark matter [2]. Since then, much research
has been devoted to dark matter but no candidate for the missing dark matter in the
Universe has been detected and conrmed. The presently dominant theory is that the
dark matter consists of particles [3]. Still another possibility would be that the laws of
gravity and the theory of general relativity are incomplete and merely special cases of
yet another, more general, theory.

Although direct evidence for dark matter is scarce, some conclusions can be drawn
about its nature from experiments and observations. Dark matter does not seem to inter-
act with ordinary matter through either the electromagnetic or strong interaction [4],
making it problematic to detect. Even though it cannot be seen directly, the impact of
dark matter through gravity can be measured. The mass-energy ratio between ordinary
matter and dark matter has been shown to be approximately 1 : 5 in experiments [5]. Fur-
thermore, the majority of the energy content of the Universe seems to be an altogether
dierent kind of energy, dark energy. However, dark energy seems to not interact directly

2

with matter and will therefore not be studied in detail. Current experiments show that
the distribution of the total mass-energy of the universe is 4.9 % ordinary matter, 26.8 %
dark matter and 68.3 % dark energy [5].

The prevailing approach to explain and understand dark matter today is to look
for a more fundamental theory to replace the standard model. So far, the behavior of
all observed particles and interactions has successfully been explained by the standard
model. However, to account for dark matter particles, it is now believed that a more
general theory exists that coincides with the standard model in the low-energy limit [6].
Dark matter research can be divided into several parts. Firstly, theory predicts dier-
ent kinds of particles with certain properties. These are then analyzed and compared to
experimental data to narrow the possibilities. Lastly, experiments try to detect dierent
particles while continuously rening constraints. The main objective is to nd a particle
which fullls all theoretical requirements as well as being experimentally veriable. The
present study focuses on the part where predicted particles are analyzed and compared
to experimental data.

This report will start with an introduction of the basic tools for analyzing the abun-
dance of dark matter in the Universe. The theory of an expanding universe tells us
that a long time ago, the Universe was much hotter and denser. A model for dark mat-
ter will be created based on the assumption that a given species of dark matter was in
equilibrium with its surroundings at some point in time. From this model it will be deter-
mined at what time the particles fell out of equilibrium due to decrease in temperature.
This concept, called freeze-out, will be explained in section 2.4. Moreover, an estimate
of the remaining abundance of the species today will be computed and constraints on
particle parameters investigated. Finally, the results and conclusions are discussed and
suggestions for further research are made.

Chapter 2

Background Material

This chapter will serve to introduce the reader to the basic concepts of cosmology nec-
essary to properly appreciate the content of this report. Introducing convenient units
commonly used in this context simplies several expressions otherwise cluttered with
natural constants. An explanation of the units is given in section 2.1. The expanding
universe together with the metric of general relativity constitute the framework for cos-
mology research and are briey explained in sections 2.2 and 2.3. As the major subject
of this report is dark matter, key concepts of dark matter are presented in section 2.4
together with some exploration of the current theories. Finally, section 2.5 contains a
thorough derivation of the Boltzmann equation, which is the main tool used in this study
to analyze the dark matter abundance.

2.1 Natural Units

Throughout this report, natural units, commonly used in cosmology and particle physics,
will be used unless otherwise stated. This means that the natural constants , c and kB
are set to 1. Keeping the unit electron volt (eV), every other unit can then be expressed
in eV by multiplying with an appropriate combination of , c and kB. As an example,
the procedure for converting mass in the SI-unit kg to mass in the natural unit eV is

1 kg = 1 kg √ó c2

= 8.988 √ó 1016 kg m2 s‚àí2
= 8.988 √ó 1016 J/1.602 √ó 10‚àí19 J/eV
= 5.610 √ó 1035 eV.

(2.1)

With this convention, the process of converting from any other unit to eV is univocal.
Furthermore, metric prexes can be used together with eV. In this report GeV will be
the most frequently used unit.

2.2 The Expanding Universe

The Universe has expanded ever since the Big Bang. It is important to remember that
space itself is expanding and that objects are not simply being hurled outwards into
space. This means that the expansion can be described by the cosmic scale factor

4

a(t) which describes how the distance between points at rest with respect to each other
evolves in time due to the expansion of the Universe. Only its relative value is relevant
as a(t) is a scale factor, therefore it is commonly set to 1 at the present time [7]. It is
also convenient to introduce the Hubble parameter
H(t) ‚â° Àôa(t)
a(t)

(2.2)

,

where the dot denotes derivative with respect to time, a convention which will be used
throughout this report. A recent measurement shows that the present value of the Hubble
parameter is H0 = 67.4 (km/s)/Mpc [5]. Furthermore, it has been conrmed that the
expansion of the Universe is presently accelerating, or in mathematical terms ¬®a(t) > 0 [8].
Consequently, both a(t) and Àôa(t) are time dependent implying that H(t), in general, varies
with time.

An implication of the expanding universe is that an ambiguity arises when den-
ing distances. Two dierent distances will be used to describe dierent phenomena.
Firstly, physical distance is proportional to the scale factor and constitutes the distance
an experiment would measure. Secondly, comoving distance is the distance between two
coordinates on an imaginary grid which expands together with space itself. The comov-
ing distance between two objects at rest relative to each other will always be the same,
regardless of the expansion, whereas the physical distance will be time dependent.

2.3 Metric

A metric denes the distance between points in a given metric space. For example in 2D
Cartesian coordinates the distance dl is given by

dl2 = dx2 + dy2.

For small distances, the same distance expressed in polar coordinates is

dl2 = dr2 + r2dŒ∏2,

where x and y are the Cartesian coordinates and r and Œ∏ are the polar coordinates.
Even though the distances are calculated dierently, the result is invariant with respect
to coordinate system. Thus, the metric acts on coordinates to produce a coordinate-
invariant measure of distance. Another way to express this is by using tensors,

dl2 = gijxixj,

where gij is the metric tensor. Throughout this report we use the Einstein summation
convention, which means that terms are summed over repeated indices. Roman indices
are summed over the three spatial coordinates, while Greek indices are summed over the
four spacetime coordinates.

The commonly used metric associated with an expanding universe is

where the rst element is temporal and the remaining are spatial. This is the metric that
will be used throughout this report. By assuming that the Universe is homogeneous and
isotropic on large scales, the scale factor a(t) becomes space invariant. These assumptions
simplify the mathematics and are supported by experiments [9]. Furthermore, we will
need the Christoel symbol

which contains information of the curvature of space. It will be used in section 2.5 to
describe an expanding universe. A rigorous derivation is beyond the scope this report.

Introduction to Dark Matter

2.4.1 Dark Matter Abundance

Most of the common theories describing dark matter assumes that the dark matter we
observe constitutes of dierent kinds of particles, called species. The particles emit no
electromagnetic radiation and are therefore only detectable through their gravitational
interaction with ordinary matter.

In the early Universe, interactions were frequent as a consequence of the energetic
environment. Due to the high interaction rate, it is possible to assume that every al-
lowed interaction occurs at a frequency high enough to ensure that any deviations from
equilibrium quickly diminishes. Thus, the dark matter particles are believed to have
been in thermodynamical equilibrium. This means that they were in mechanical, chem-
ical, thermal and radiative equilibrium. As the Universe expanded, the interaction rate
between dark matter and ordinary matter decreased, causing the particles to decouple.
Essentially, decoupling means that the particles stop interacting and the number of par-
ticles after decoupling, the relic abundance, will remain roughly constant. Decoupling is
a continuous process, as will be shown in chapter 3, but it is quick compared to the age of
the Universe due to the expansion of space as well as decrease in temperature [10]. Before
decoupling, the distribution of dark matter is simply given by the Boltzmann distribution
as it is in thermodynamical equilibrium. The evolution of dark matter out of equilibrium
is harder to predict and is given by the Boltzmann equation presented in section 2.5.
This process, where the species starts in equilibrium and eventually decouples, is called
the freeze-out scenario and decoupling itself is sometimes referred to as freeze-out.

The concept of critical density œÅc is commonly used in cosmology.

In a simplied
model with no dark energy one can think of the critical density as the mass-energy
density if the Universe contains exactly enough mass to be the watershed point between
expanding forever and collapsing. This special case is called a at universe.
If the
density is any higher, the expansion of the Universe will slow down and eventually start
to contract, a closed universe. On the other hand, if the density is lower, the Universe
would keep expanding forever, an open universe. It is possible to derive the expression

œÅc =

3H 2
8œÄG

(2.5)

directly from the Friedmann equations in a model without dark energy [11]. Including
dark energy is complicated because it is dierent from all other kinds of matter and

6

energy in the sense that dark energy is expanding space itself which drags everything
along with it.

Quantication of a substance can be made through the density parameter dened as

‚Ñ¶ ‚â° œÅ
œÅc

=

8œÄGœÅ
3H 2 ,

(2.6)

which basically is the ratio between the density œÅ of the relevant substance and the critical
density. The matter, dark matter and dark energy quantities will henceforth be given
the subscripts M, DM and Œõ respectively. According to recent measurements, the total
density is equal to the critical density and the distribution is as follows: ‚Ñ¶M = 4.9 %,
‚Ñ¶DM = 26.8 % and ‚Ñ¶Œõ = 68.3 % [5].

2.4.2 Evidence

An indication of the existence of dark matter was given by analysis of the rotational
velocity of galaxies, as mentioned in chapter 1. Using Kepler's third law it can be
expected that the rotational velocity as a function of distance from the center will follow

v(r) =

GM (r)

r

,

(2.7)

(cid:114)

(cid:90) r

where r is the distance from the center, G is Newton's gravitational constant and M (r)
is the total mass within the radius r. The mass M (r) is given by

M (r) = 4œÄ

œÅ(r)r2 dr,

where œÅ(r) is the mass density, under the assumption of spherical symmetry. We would
expect that v(r) ‚àù 1/
In practice,
measurements are made on hydrogen clouds orbiting outside the luminous parts of the
galaxy. However, measurements show that v is in fact almost constant in the region
where a decrease would be expected [12]. Thus, M ‚àù r and consequently œÅ ‚àù 1/r2 [13].
There are several other pieces of evidence supporting the existence of dark matter

such as:

‚Ä¢ Strong gravitational lensing by elliptical galaxies [14].
‚Ä¢ Mass-to-light ration inferred from velocity dispersion of galaxies in clusters [15].
‚Ä¢ Analysis of cosmic microwave background anisotropies [16].

2.4.3 Candidates

There are several dark matter candidates since very little is known about their nature and
few constraints can be made. The parameter values for dierent candidates often span
several orders of magnitude. For example, the masses of proposed dark matter particles
span more than 20 orders of magnitude [10]. In the freeze-out scenario studied in this
report, a common candidate is a weakly interacting massive particle, often referred to as
WIMP. As indicated by their name, WIMPs are relatively heavy and are presumed to only

7

interact through gravitation and the weak force [10]. Relatively heavy in this context
means that the particle mass is roughly in the order of 1011 eV. One of the reasons
why WIMPs are popular is because the parameter values predicted by theory yields
the correct relic abundance, a phenomenon sometimes called the WIMP miracle [17].
Besides WIMPs, there exists a plethora of dierent candidates. A comprehensive review
of several candidates can be found in the work of Bertone et al. [10].

2.5 The Boltzmann Equation

2.5.1 The Liouville Operator

The evolution of the phase space distribution of particles f (p, x, t) is governed by the
Boltzmann equation

where

L[f ] = C[f ],

L = pŒ± ‚àÇ

‚àÇxŒ± ‚àí ŒìŒ±

Œ≤Œ≥pŒ≤pŒ≥ ‚àÇ
‚àÇpŒ±

(2.9)

(2.10)

is the Liouville operator and C is the collision operator [18]. The collision operator
describes interactions between particles and will be introduced in section 2.5.2. Firstly,
we can observe that only derivatives of f appear on the left-hand side of eq. (2.9). The two
derivatives are with respect to x and p respectively, implying that the change in the phase
space distribution with respect to space and momentum depends on the interactions of
particles.

We assume that the phase space distribution function is both homogeneous and iso-
tropic, so that f (p, x, t) = f (E, t). Under these assumptions the Liouville operator (2.10)
acting on f takes on a simpler form. Recalling that p0 = E, the rst term collapses to just
the temporal term of the implicit sum. For the same reason, the second term disappears
for all values of the summation index Œ±, except when Œ± = 0. Since Œì0
0i = 0
and Œì0

ij = Œ¥ij Àôaa we obtain

00 = Œì0

i0 = Œì0

is the norm of the spatial momentum vector and the 2 is an exponent, not a contravariant
index) and used denition (2.2) of the Hubble parameter.

,

Consider the Boltzmann equation (2.9). Using the expression in eq. (2.11), multiply-

ing both sides by d3p/((2œÄ)2E) and integrating over the whole phase space we obtain

(2.14)

Invoking our assumption of homogeneity and isotropy we can integrate the angular parts
of the integral, which introduces an overall factor 4œÄ and a factor p2 in the integrand.
This leaves a one-dimensional integral of p from 0 to ‚àû. A simple calculation shows that,
demanding the integral of f over all phase space to be nite, f must fall to zero faster
than p‚àí3 as p ‚Üí ‚àû. Thus, using integration by parts on the right-hand side integral of
eq. (2.14) we obtain

(2.15)

where the bracketed term disappears. We can revert this to an integral over the whole
phase space again by eliminating the factors 4œÄ and p2 from the integrand.

By expressing the number density n(t) as

f (E, t) d3p,

(2.16)

where g is the degeneracy, we can nally rewrite the left-hand side of eq. (2.12). Using
eqs. (2.13) through (2.16), as well as incorporating g into f, we can rewrite eq. (2.12) as

2.5.2 The Collision Operator

We now turn our attention to the right-hand side of eq. (2.17), the expression containing
information about the interactions of dierent species. Consider a process

œà + a + b + ¬∑¬∑¬∑ ‚Üî i + j + ¬∑¬∑¬∑ ,

where œà is the dark matter species of interest. Then, the right-hand side of eq. (2.17) is

the rst line of eq. (2.18) tells us that we must sum over the whole phase space for every
particle to obtain all interactions. Secondly, the next line enforces the conservation of
momentum and energy upon the process. Lastly, the two remaining lines represent the
rate of the process going one way or the other. Thus, the production of œà (together with
a, b,¬∑¬∑¬∑ ) is proportional to fifj ¬∑¬∑¬∑ and the opposite process is proportional to fœàfafb ¬∑¬∑¬∑ .
Simplications of eq. (2.18) can be made. By assuming that the interaction is re-

versible, we dene

|M| ‚â° |M|œà+a+b+¬∑¬∑¬∑‚Üíi+j+¬∑¬∑¬∑ = |M|i+j+¬∑¬∑¬∑‚Üíœà+a+b+¬∑¬∑¬∑.

Our next assumption is the absence of degenerate matter and Bose-Einstein condensates.
This allows us to use Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics as well as approximate the blocking
and stimulated emission factor 1 ¬± fx ‚âà 1 for all species. To summarize, we have

(2.20)

(cid:90)

Investigating eq. (2.20) we observe that the change in the number density over time can
be described by two terms. One term accounts for all interactions by which the species in
question is created or annihilated and one term is a direct consequence of the expansion
of the Universe, 3Hnœà.

2.5.3 A Change of Variables

As the eect of the species being diluted by the expansion of the Universe is trivial, the

In cosmology, it can be useful to measure temporal evolution in a suitable strictly
monotonic function of t, other than time itself, when time is not the quantity which is

of physical relevance. When studying the evolution of the Universe, the natural measure
of time is usually the temperature T which is a strictly decreasing function of t. In the

The general Boltzmann equation (2.9) has now been simplied using the following

assumptions:

‚Ä¢ The Universe is homogeneous and isotropic.
‚Ä¢ Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics are valid.
‚Ä¢ The processes are reversible.

All of the assumptions above are general, thus eq. (2.29) holds for any particle in the
Universe. Exploiting specic properties of the dark matter in our model, it will be further
developed in section 3.2.

Investigation

3.1 Problem

One of the key questions in dark matter research is how much dark matter would remain
today, under certain assumptions about the initial state of the Universe and properties
of the dark matter particles. In this report, the freeze-out scenario will be the primary
approach to analyze the dark matter evolution. Supposing that the abundance at an ear-
lier time is known, it is possible to calculate the relic density today using the Boltzmann
equation developed in section 2.5. On the other hand, using experimental values of the
present dark matter density of the Universe, the Boltzmann equation can be used to put
specic constraints on the dark matter particle parameters. We will argue that the rele-
vant free parameters are the thermally averaged cross section, introduced in section 3.2,
and the particle mass. Having to consider only these two parameters will allow us to put
stringent constraints on the parameter space.

In section 3.2.1 the Boltzmann equation from section 2.5 will be further modied
to analyze relic abundances in the freeze-out model. Section 3.2.2 discusses the relation
between Y and the density parameter ‚Ñ¶. The dierential equation for the relic abundance
is analyzed and approximate analytical expressions for the present relic abundance are
derived in section 3.3. The numerical analysis of the Boltzmann equation is described in
section 3.4. The results are presented in section 3.5 and discussed in section 3.6.

is used. The cross section essentially contains information of how likely collisions between
particles are, similarly to a classical cross section. Furthermore, using the change of

can be made. It has now implicitly been assumed that (cid:104)œÉv(cid:105) is independent of x, thus
œÉ0 = (cid:104)œÉv(cid:105) in the model used. The function Œª is chosen to be independent of x by letting
x = 1 and leaving the dependence of x in the factor x‚àí2. Thus, Œª can be treated as a
constant within certain limits. A detailed discussion of Œª is found in section 3.6.1.

3.2.2 Quantication of Relic Abundance

Up to this point, quantication of the abundance has been expressed by Y . This is con-
venient for the mathematical analysis but when comparing calculated values to measured
ones, the density parameter ‚Ñ¶ will be used. The relation between Y and ‚Ñ¶ is given by

‚Ñ¶0 =

(3.11)

where the second equality is given by eq. (2.5). The subscript 0 denotes the present
day value and s0 = 2889.2 cm‚àí3 is the entropy density assuming three Dirac neutrino
species [10]. By inserting numerical values and converting to natural units, the relation

‚Ñ¶0 = 6.04 √ó 108 m
GeV

Y0

(3.12)

is obtained.

3.3 Analytical Calculations

The relic density of a particular dark matter species is determined by eq. (3.10) which is a
Riccati dierential equation. It is ordinary and non-linear and no closed-form analytical
solutions are known. However, we can use the physics behind the equation to extract
some information from it.

3.3.1 Freeze-out Scenario

In the early universe, when x is small, the dark matter species is expected to have been in
thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. In thermal equilibrium, the initial condition
is Y = YEQ. Consequently, by analyzing eq. (3.10), we conclude that dY /dx = 0.
The function Y will initially follow YEQ, but eventually the x‚àí2 factor will dominate
the (Y 2‚àíY 2
EQ) factor and Y will remain roughly constant while YEQ continues to decrease.
The point at which Y stops tracing YEQ is the freeze-out and the values of Y and x at
freeze-out are denoted by Yf and xf, respectively.
Consider a hot relic, which decouples while relativistic. This will be the case if xf (cid:46) 3.
For x (cid:46) 3, YEQ stays approximately constant, so the asymptotic value of Y as x ‚Üí ‚àû,
Y‚àû, will be

Y‚àû ‚âà YEQ(xf).

(3.13)

In this case it is hard to precisely dene the freeze-out time xf. However, since Y will
stay approximately constant, a precise denition of xf is not necessary to make an order
of magnitude approximation of Y‚àû.
A cold relic decouples when non-relativistic, that is xf (cid:38) 3. At early times Y will
trace YEQ. As the temperature drops and the species decouple, annihilations do not occur
frequently enough to maintain equilibrium anymore. Subsequently YEQ will become much
smaller than Y and the right-hand side of eq. (3.10) will be dominated by the Y 2 term
for x > xf. This allows us to simplify the equation to

dY

‚âà ‚àí Œª

(3.14)

tion from xf to ‚àû, eq. (3.14) yields

(3.15)

At suciently late times, Y will be smaller than at freeze-out. Thus, a rough approxi-
mation of the relic density after freeze-out can be made,

Y‚àû ‚âà xf
Œª

.

(3.16)

3.3.2 Determining the Freeze-out Time

Although we derived an approximate expression in eq. (3.16) for determining the present
relic density, it still depends on the freeze-out time, which has so far only been vaguely
dened. For a cold relic, where the deviation from equilibrium is immediately apparent,
an expression for the freeze-out time can be derived. We introduce a well-chosen constant
c of order unity such that

Yf = (c + 1)YEQ(xf).

(3.17)

Substituting eq. (3.17) into (3.15) yields an equation with only xf unknown. It is, however,
problematic to solve analytically. A numerical approximation of the solution is

where a = 0.145(cid:0)g/g‚àóS

is obtained. This can be reformulated, by collecting constants in K, as

the factor mY‚àû allowing us to treat it as a constant implying that it can be neglected

3.4 Numerical Analysis

Numerical methods are used to calculate Y (x) using eq. (3.10) for dierent cases. For
practically all cases studied, Œª will at least be in the order of 108. This results in a numeri-
cally sti equation which essentially means that it is dicult to integrate using numerical
methods. It is possible to circumvent this by introducing the change of variables

W (x) ‚â° ln(Y (x)),

(3.23)

with WEQ dened analogously, as made by Steigman et al. [19], leading to the reformu-
lation

(3.24)

of eq. (3.10). Firstly, W varies over fewer orders of magnitude which greatly decreases
the computational power required to solve the equation. Secondly, it is now possible
to obtain fairly accurate solutions even when using low precision which was practically
impossible in the original, stier form.
The general approach taken is to solve eq. (3.24) in the interval 100 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 103 and
then transform W (x) back to Y (x) using denition (3.23). Furthermore, the relic density
today ‚Ñ¶0 is given by eq. (3.12) where Y (103) = Y‚àû is assumed. By varying the parameters
and calculating the corresponding relic density, it is possible to set up constraints on the
parameter space. One of the main purposes of the numerical analysis is to nd the (cid:104)œÉv(cid:105)
necessary to obtain the correct abundance today for dierent m. Moreover, numerical
solutions can be used to verify the analytical approximation (3.16).

3.5 Results

A family of solutions to eq. (3.10) is shown in g. 3.1. The gure illustrates the concept
of freeze-out as well as the implications of an increasing cross section. For x < 10, the
solution closely tracks equilibrium due to the high interaction rate. Freeze-out is where
Y starts to deviate from equilibrium which is at x ‚âà 25 for the specic parameter values
used. At this point, the expansion rate of the universe starts to overshadow the interaction
rate in the sense that particles have drifted apart to such an extent that interactions are
not frequent enough to maintain equilibrium. Consequently, it is possible to observe
how the solution decreases more slowly and becomes almost constant, it freezes-out.
The implication of an increasing cross section is that it allows the particles to remain
in equilibrium for a longer period since they interact more easily. Subsequently, if the
particles remain in equilibrium until a later time, the relic abundance will decrease since
the equilibrium abundance drops exponentially.
Figure 3.2 shows the numerically calculated relation between (cid:104)œÉv(cid:105) and m in a model
where they are the only parameters. With only two parameters it is possible to use the
relic abundance, obtained through experiments, as a constraint allowing us to correlate
(cid:104)œÉv(cid:105) to m. Since the semi-log plot basically is a straight line, there is reason to believe
that

(3.25)
within the interval 101 GeV ‚â§ m ‚â§ 104 GeV with the model used. In g. 3.2, it is possible
to observe that (cid:104)œÉv(cid:105) varies roughly a factor 1.4 while m which varies over 3 orders of
magnitude. Hence, the relic abundance is more sensitive to dierences in (cid:104)œÉv(cid:105) than m.

where all other parameters are xed. The concept of remaining in equilibrium, freeze-out
and being decoupled are shown.

Two of the introduced methods of calculating Y‚àû are using the analytical approx-
imation (3.16) and numerically solving eq. (3.10). It is reasonable to consider the nu-
merical solution Y‚àû,N to be exact when compared to the analytical approximation Y‚àû,A.
Consequently, it is possible to investigate the error in the analytical approximation for
dierent values of Œª. The agreement between the two methods is shown in g. 3.3 where
the well-chosen constant c has been set to 0.6 and the top x-axis is calculated using
approximation (3.18). Considering the error caused by all simplications made, the ratio
Y‚àû,N/Y‚àû,A can be considered to be close to 1 within the studied interval of Œª.

3.6 Discussion

3.6.1 Remarks on Œª

Throughout the analysis, denition (3.9) of Œª has been used. It relies on eq. (2.25) and
denition (2.28) which are both limited but spans the relevant time interval. It has been
assumed that g‚àó = g‚àóS = 100 which is a good approximation for T > 0.1 GeV [13]. This
is what determines the limit for large xf. Despite the limitations on the temperature, the
model has been used to describe evolution until x = m/T = 10/T = 103 implying that
T = 0.01 GeV. This is acceptable as the time of freeze-out is roughly x = 10 which is
within the range of the model. Hence, any errors caused by inaccuracies in the model are
negligible since the abundance after freeze-out is nearly constant almost regardless of the
model and parameters. Moreover, it has been assumed that only s-wave annihilation is
allowed. The details of the annihilation process itself is beyond the scope of this report
but essentially the assumption implies that (cid:104)œÉv(cid:105) is independent of x and that the power

parameters and experimental data is used as a constraint.

of x in the denominator in eq. (3.10) is 2. It is then reasonable to assume that the model
used is limited to a certain interval but still able to fulll its purpose within acceptable
tolerances.

Limitations at early times in the freeze-out model is determined by the validity of
eq. (2.25) and denition (2.28) upon which Œª relies. They are important to remember
since other scenarios might include times which requires other models to describe the
relation between T and t or the expansion of the Universe. It is xf that determines the
necessary model since the evolution before xf is described by equilibrium and is simply
constant after xf.

One notable characteristic of the solutions to eq. (3.10) is that larger Œª yields lower
relic densities, which is an expected result. This phenomenon can be seen in g. 3.1.
Firstly, this is in accordance with the analytical result (3.16). Secondly, the physical
explanation is that the probability of particles interacting is proportional to Œª. Conse-
quently, as remaining in equilibrium requires a high interaction rate, the time of freeze-out
also increases for increasing Œª. As a result, the relic density will decrease due to a later
freeze-out. Furthermore, large Œª also motivates the assumption that the dark matter
particles were initially in equilibrium. This will be further discussed in section 3.6.3.

The opposite scenario, when Œª is small, is more complicated because assumption that
the dark matter particles remained in thermal equilibrium at early times might not be
applicable. This is divided into two dierent cases, either the particles were created at
some time and never reached equilibrium, the freeze-in scenario, or the particles have
been in equilibrium at a time where the model described in section 3.2 is inapplicable.

Freeze-in is essentially described by the same mathematical framework even though
the physics behind it is slightly dierent. Particles which freeze-in are assumed to have
a negligible initial abundance which at some point in time starts to grow. The freeze-

in scenario favors small Œª, typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the ones
considered in freeze-out. Hence, the particles never reach equilibrium but abundance
increases until the interaction rate drops below the expansion rate after which the co-
moving density remains constant. Analogously to freeze-out, this is called freeze-in and
can be analyzed using similar methods. The main dierence is regarding the initial state
of the particles and the time at which the density starts to increase.

3.6.2 Comparing Analytical Calculations to Numerical Results
The results presented in g. 3.2 shows the relation between (cid:104)œÉv(cid:105) and m enforced by ‚Ñ¶0.
The relation between the two parameters was already predicted by the analytical approx-
imation (3.22). This relation can be compared to relation (3.25) which was obtained by
the gure. This can be explained by the variation in (cid:104)œÉv(cid:105) being small when compared to
the variations in m. Consequently, it is possible to treat the last term in relation (3.22)
as a constant implying that it can be neglected. Thus, the analytical calculation is in
accordance with the numerical results. Alternatively, it is possible to think of the con-
tribution of the log ((cid:104)œÉv(cid:105))-term as negligible and therefore being hard to detect in the
gure. Finally, it is crucial to emphasize that relation (3.25) is constrained by ‚Ñ¶0 in
conjunction with the model used and not by any physical relation between (cid:104)œÉv(cid:105) and m
or any model relating them to each other. The relation should therefore not be thought
of as a necessary requirement for particles predicted by theory but rather as a limitation

19

on which particles are considered suitable, in the sense that the correct relic density is
obtained according to our model.

As seen in g. 3.3, the agreement between the analytical approximation (3.16) and
numerical solutions to eq. (3.10) is relatively good. This implies that the analytical
approximation is useful for estimating Y‚àû without having to solve the dierential equa-
tion.
It is worth mentioning that the range of Œª spans several orders of magnitude
which is of little physical relevance since it is indirectly constrained by the experimen-
tal values of ‚Ñ¶0 in conjunction with (cid:104)œÉv(cid:105) and m. For concreteness, a typical value is
(cid:104)œÉv(cid:105) = 1.8 √ó 10‚àí26 cm3 s‚àí1 implying m = 102 GeV, as shown in g. 3.2, which corre-
sponds to Œª = 3.5 √ó 1013. The large interval was solely used to show that the analytical
approximation is valid even for values of the parameters (cid:104)œÉv(cid:105) and m outside of the stud-
ied model. Moreover, the gure starts at xf < 1 and shows good results even though the
analytical approximation was presented as being valid for xf (cid:38) 3. Further investigation
showed that for xf < 3, the analytical approximation became more sensitive to c indi-
cating that the approximation should be used with caution when xf is small. However,
it is important to remember that approximation (3.18) has been used to calculate xf
throughout this analysis which also introduces an error. This error is hard to quantify
since xf is a concept rather than an exact time, consequently, it lacks a strict denition.

3.6.3 Further remarks

Numerical calculations were used to analyze the error caused by some assumptions. As
mentioned in section 3.1, it is assumed that the initial condition Y (1) = YEQ(1) is valid for
freeze-out. It is possible to motivate this by solving eq. (3.10) to nd Y‚àû with practically
arbitrary initial conditions. As seen in g. 3.4, all solutions falls into equilibrium before
freeze-out. The upper and lower initial conditions are Y (1) = YEQ(1) √ó 10¬±3. The gure
also shows that increasing values for Œª leads to quicker regression toward equilibrium. It is
also important to emphasize that the Œª used are several orders of magnitude smaller than
those encountered in common WIMP scenarios, any realistic Œª would almost instantly
return to equilibrium. Consequently, the assumption regarding the initial condition is
valid.

Secondly, it has been assumed that Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics are valid when
calculating the equilibrium distribution given by eq. (2.16). When using Fermi-Dirac
or Bose-Einstein statistics instead, discrepancies are introduced, shown in g. 3.5.
It
shows that the quantum mechanical eects have a small impact that is limited to early
times when the particles were in equilibrium. Thus, since both the Fermi-Dirac and
Bose-Einstein solution coincide with the Maxwell-Boltzmann solution before freeze-out,
it is safe to neglect the dierences as only the abundance at freeze-out aects the relic
density.

Another major assumption is that all dark matter consists of only one type of particle.
Mathematically this translates to ‚Ñ¶œà = ‚Ñ¶DM. Since there is very little knowledge of
dark matter and its constituents, it is hard to determine whether the assumption is
justied or not. This is only relevant when comparing calculated values to experimental
data and does not aect the model unless the dierent kinds of dark matter particles
are interacting. Hence, it is important to remember that the computations involving
comparison with experimental data in this report needs to be revised if there exist several
kinds of dark matter particles.

Figure 3.4: The initial condition is motivated by the solution quickly approaching equi-
librium due to the high interaction rate. Large Œª causes deviations to diminish quicker
and vice versa, note that the Œª used are very small in this context. The extreme initial
conditions are Y (1) = YEQ(1) √ó 10¬±3.

As mentioned in section 3.2, the only allowed interaction is self-annihilation. Interac-
tions with ordinary matter has been neglected which is motivated by the very nature of
dark matter. Furthermore, symmetry between œà and ¬Øœà has been assumed, meaning that
an equal number of both exists. This must not necessarily be the case and is therefore
another uncertain assumption that has been made.

Finally, we can compare our results to typical theoretically predicted values for
WIMPs. As described in section 2.4.3, one of the main reasons WIMPs are popular
is because the predicted parameter values leads to the correct relic density. We ap-
proached this by choosing the mass interval to match popular candidates. Consequently,
our calculated constraints are expected to meet the theoretically predicted values for
(cid:104)œÉv(cid:105). This can be veried by comparing our results with previous works, for example the
paper by Steigman et al. [19]. In particular, g. 3.2 can be compared to g. 5 in their
article. Our result is less accurate since the model used is simpler but it is still possible
to tell that they are very similar.

3.6.4 Future Work

This report has implemented arguably the most simple non-trivial model for the Universe
and the dark matter particles. Almost every assumption mentioned throughout this
report can be studied more thoroughly. Some will prove to result in negligible errors,
similar to the more detailed study of the eect of the initial condition, while others
certainly are crucial to the nal results. For example, further research should be done
to investigate the possibility of dierent kinds of dark matter particles since it is highly
likely to aect the results.

Figure 3.5: The gure shows the small dierences between Fermi-Dirac, Bose-Einstein
and Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics at early times. This shows that Maxwell-Boltzmann
statistics may be used since all solutions coincide before freeze-out and, consequently, the
relic abundance is the same regardless of distribution used.

Besides making a more accurate model, the current model can applied to other sce-
narios than just freeze-out. As previously mentioned, the freeze-in scenario relies on a
similar mathematical framework but allows entirely dierent candidates since the physi-
cal processes are dierent. Some signicant dierences are that (cid:104)œÉv(cid:105) is several orders of
magnitude smaller than in a freeze-out scenario and the time of freeze-in is also several
orders of magnitude smaller than xf. Moreover, it is possible to investigate the evolution
of particles at late times with slight modications to the model presented in this report.
This is of interest since observations could potentially measure ‚Ñ¶DM at earlier times. The
expected result is that ‚Ñ¶DM = ‚Ñ¶DM,0 since the dark matter abundance is expected to be
constant. However, this could still be used to determine how constant the density is at
late times which theoretically could act as a constraint.

Summary and Conclusions

The present study was designed to determine the evolution of the dark matter abundance
in the Universe and to put constraints on the parameter space of an unknown dark matter
particle. In the report we have developed the tools necessary to analyze the abundance
of dark matter in our Universe. For the mathematical analysis, a thorough derivation of
the Boltzmann equation for dark matter was made. Supposing that the dark matter is of
particulate nature, we continued to develop a model where the dark matter is assumed
to have been in equilibrium at some time, the freeze-out model.

For determining the dark matter relic abundance, the Boltzmann equation (3.10) is
developed. It is then possible to give an approximate closed-form expression (3.16) for
the relic abundance. Comparing with numerical solutions in g. 3.1 shows that the ap-
proximate value is valid to an accuracy of 15 % in the relevant interval. The numerical
solutions show that the abundance closely follows the equilibrium abundance initially.
When the abundance starts to deviate from equilibrium it quickly stabilizes and be-
comes constant, allowing us to extrapolate that value to the present relic abundance. As
expected, a larger cross section means that the dark matter abundance stays in equi-
librium longer, leading to lower relic density since the equilibrium abundance decreases
exponentially in x.

Using the recently measured value of ‚Ñ¶DM = 0.268 to correlate the cross section and
particle mass, we show that the allowed cross section seems to depend logarithmically
on the particle mass. This result is also motivated by direct analysis of the Boltzmann
equation. The dependance is shown in g. 3.2 and makes evident that the relic abundance
is very insensitive to the mass of the particle. In fact, in this model, the cross section
can be determined to a very narrow interval. To yield the correct relic density, a particle
in the freeze-out model should have a cross section

1.6 cm3 s‚àí1 < (cid:104)œÉv(cid:105) < 2.2 cm3 s‚àí1,

(4.1)

an interval which may be augmented if considering a candidate with mass outside of the
interval 101 GeV < m < 104 GeV.

While these results do not directly answer the question of what dark matter actually
consists of, they are a small step in determining where to look for particle dark matter.
Some suggestions for further work has been made, for example analyzing the possibility
of dark matter constituting of several kinds of particles. To sum up, more experimental
research is required to actually nd the particles and conrm the theory.
