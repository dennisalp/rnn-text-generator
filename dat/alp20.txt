Abstract

The ﬁrst electromagnetic signal from a supernova (SN) is released when the shock crosses the progenitor surface.
This shock breakout (SBO) emission provides constraints on progenitor and explosion properties. Observationally,
SBOs appear as minute- to hour-long extragalactic X-ray transients. They are challenging to detect and only one
SBO has been observed to date. Here, we search the XMM-Newton archive and ﬁnd 12 new SN SBO candidates.
We identify host galaxies to nine of these at estimated redshifts of 0.1–1. The SBO candidates have energies of
∼1046 erg, timescales of 30–3000 s, and temperatures of 0.1–1 keV. They are all consistent with being SN SBOs,
but some may be misidentiﬁed Galactic foreground sources or other extragalactic objects. SBOs from blue
supergiants agree well with most of the candidates. However, a few could be SBOs from Wolf–Rayet stars
surrounded by dense circumstellar media, whereas two are more naturally explained as SBOs from red supergiants.
The observations tentatively support non-spherical SBOs and are in agreement with asymmetries predicted by
recent three-dimensional SN explosion simulations. eROSITA may detect ∼2 SBOs per year, which could be
detected in live analyses and promptly followed up.

1. Introduction

The shock breakout (SBO) emission is the ﬁrst electro-
magnetic signal from a supernova (SN; Waxman & Katz 2017;
Levinson & Nakar 2019). This emission carries information
about the structure of the progenitor star. The most important
physical properties that can be constrained are the progenitor
radius, asymmetries, and ﬁnal mass-loss history. This means
that SBOs offer a unique avenue to probe SN progenitors
(Smartt 2009) and the SN explosion mechanism (Janka et al.
2016).

The SBO emission is released when the radiation-mediated
shock from the SN explosion crosses the surface of the star.
However, if the circumstellar medium (CSM) is sufﬁciently
dense, the shock can propagate into the CSM and result in a
longer “CSM breakout.” SBOs from the progenitor surface
typically peak in X-rays, and evolve into ultraviolet and optical
as the envelope cools and the ejecta expand. Extended CSM
breakouts and the post-breakout cooling phase evolve on
timescales of >1 day and are easier to detect. These timescales
are within the reach of recent wide-ﬁeld optical SN surveys
(Waxman & Katz 2017 and references therein). Henceforth, we
focus on X-ray SBOs that evolve on timescales much shorter
than 1day. The initial SBO and post-breakout cooling phase
precede the commonly observed, months-long SN emission
that is powered by reprocessed radioactive decay.

The observable properties of SN SBOs are expected to be
different for different progenitor types. Typical SBO energies,
timescales, and temperatures (Matzner & McKee 1999; Nakar
& Sari 2010; Sapir et al. 2013) for red supergiants (RSGs) are
1048erg, 1000 s, and 0.03 keV, respectively. The corresp-
onding values are 1046.5 erg, 100 s, and 0.3 keV for blue
supergiants (BSGs); and 1045erg, 10 s, and 3 keV for Wolf–
Rayet (WR) stars. This assumes spherical symmetry, as well as

negligible effects of the CSM. SBOs from RSGs are very soft
and are expected to be heavily absorbed by the interstellar
medium (ISM). In contrast, WR SBOs are much harder, but the
total number of emitted photons is several orders of magnitude
lower. Both the increased temperature (higher photon energies)
and lower total energy reduce the total number of emitted
photons, which makes WR SBOs difﬁcult to detect. BSGs are
the progenitor type that is most likely to be detected due to the
trade-off between peak energy and number of emitted photons
(Calzavara & Matzner 2004; Sapir et al. 2013; Waxman &
Katz 2017). Finally, we note that
thermonuclear SNe are
expected to produce SBOs with temperatures of ∼20 keV.
These SBOs are not expected to be detectable because the
timescales are approximately 10 ms and the total energies are
on the order of 1040erg (Nakar & Sari 2010; Piro et al. 2010).
Theoretical aspects of SBOs have been studied for several
decades. Early works explored the emission from non-
relativistic SBOs with simpliﬁed physics and for speciﬁc
progenitor structures (e.g., Weaver 1976; Klein & Chevalier
1978; Ensman & Burrows 1992). More recent works have
focused on developing models for more realistic progenitor
structures with more detailed treatments of the relevant physics
(Katz et al. 2010, 2012; Nakar & Sari 2010; Sapir et al. 2011,
2013; Ito et al. 2020). Notably, several theoretical works have
stressed that many SBOs should have been serendipitously
observed by previous and existing X-ray telescopes (Klein &
Chevalier 1978; Calzavara & Matzner 2004; Sapir et al. 2013;
Sapir & Halbertal 2014; Waxman & Katz 2017). The telescopes
most likely to have detected SBOs are XMM-Newton, which
has been in service since 2000, followed by ROSAT, which
collected data between 1990 and 1999.

Despite the signiﬁcant theoretical efforts, few observational
searches have been performed, and only the SBO from
SN2008D has been detected (Soderberg et al. 2008). The
SBO detection from SN2008D was serendipitously detected as

a bright X-ray transient in a scheduled Swift observation of
NGC2770. In addition to the direct detection of SN2008D,
the SBO from SN1987A was indirectly observed by the
effects of the SBO on the CSM (Ensman & Burrows 1992;
Blinnikov et al. 2000). The only systematic searches in archival
X-ray data for transients with SBO-like properties were of the
ROSAT archive (Vikhlinin 1998; Greiner et al. 2000).
Interestingly, Vikhlinin (1998) reported a number of candidates
but was unable to securely identify their origins. While no
systematic searches for SBOs have been carried out recently,
transients on longer timescales have been studied, primarily in
the Chandra archive (Bauer et al. 2017; Xue et al. 2019; Yang
et al. 2019).

In this paper, we search for SN SBOs in archival XMM-
Newton data. Observationally, this implies that we search all
public XMM-Newton observations for X-ray transients on
timescales shorter than approximately 10ks. To our knowl-
edge, the XMM-Newton data have not been systematically
searched for this kind of transient, even though several SBOs
are predicted to be present in the data. We aim to identify SBO
candidates and investigate the implications
the SN
progenitors.

for

This paper is organized as follows. We describe the SBO
search and identiﬁcation process in Section 2, the host galaxies
in Section 3, and provide details related to the data reduction of
the ﬁnal candidates in Section 4. The spectral ﬁtting is
described in Section 5 and observed properties of the SBOs are
presented in Section 6. We investigate the SBO interpretation
and its implications in Section 7, discuss contaminants and
other potential astrophysical sources in Section 8, and conclude
in Section 9.

All uncertainties are 1σ and one-sided limits are 3σ unless stated
otherwise. We adopt a ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology with a Hubble–
Lemaître constant H0=70km s−1Mpc1 and W =L

0.73.

2. Identifying SBO Candidates

To ﬁnd SN SBO candidates, we search for X-ray transients
with typical timescales shorter than ∼10ks in archival XMM-
Newton data. These X-ray transients can only be observed if
they happen to occur within the ﬁeld of view (FoV) of an X-ray
telescope because SBOs decay well before the optical signal
from a SN is detected (typically days or weeks later). XMM-
Newton (Jansen et al. 2001) is the telescope that is most likely
to serendipitously observe SBOs because of the combination of
its high effective area, high angular resolution, and large FoV
of ∼0.2 deg2. For theoretically predicted BSG SBO properties
(Section 1), we expect our search to be sensitive to a redshift of
∼1. This assumes favorable observing conditions and a low
level of absorption along the line of sight.

Before performing a blind search for X-ray transients, we
crossmatch all XMM-Newton observations with known SNe
and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In the current context, we
restrict the matches to X-ray detections of the SBO, long before
the optical SN detection or simultaneous with the prompt GRB
phase. The purpose is to check if any known SNe or GRBs
have been serendipitously observed, but we ﬁnd none. The
catalog of SNe is from the Latest Supernovae website2 and
the GRBs are from the Swift/BAT GRB Catalog (Lien et al.
2016). The SN catalog covers the entire XMM-Newton

lifetime, while the GRB data is limited to the lifetime of Swift
because only GRBs with sufﬁciently accurate positions can be
crossmatched.

2.1. Finding Transients

To avoid detecting a large number of variable Galactic X-ray
sources unrelated to SN SBOs, we immediately reject all
sources that are close to a star in Gaia or a known Galactic
source in SIMBAD. More precisely, we reject sources within
5″ of an object in Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018)
with a (positive) parallax with a signiﬁcance greater than 3σ.
Similarly for SIMBAD, we reject X-ray sources if there is a
SIMBAD object within 5″ classiﬁed as a star, white dwarf,
neutron star, black hole, or combinations thereof (i.e.,binaries).
We develop a custom transient ﬁnder algorithm that we
apply to all observations, and also search for transients among
the sources in the 3XMM-DR8 catalog (Rosen et al. 2016). The
details of both search methods are provided in Appendix A.
The custom search algorithm is the most general and detects
any transients starting from the event lists. The 3XMM-DR8
search focuses on identifying transient behavior among the
cataloged X-ray sources. The two algorithms are largely
redundant, but are complementary in some respects. The main
difference is that our custom search is performed on all public
observations with data archived at HEASARC as of 2019
November 11, whereas the latest observation included in
3XMM-DR8 is from 2017 November 30. We note that the
standard proprietary period is 1 yr after data delivery, which
means that the availability of public data during the last 12–14
months of the time intervals is sparse. Our custom algorithm is
very simple and does not treat the background and instrumental
effects as carefully as 3XMM-DR8.

The two algorithms identify ∼11,000 transient sources and
we manually inspect the light curves, the time-integrated X-ray
spectra, and images of these objects. The spectra and images
are primarily useful for recognizing instrumental artifacts,
variability caused by problematic extraction regions, and
blended sources. Instrumental artifacts are generally restricted
to one of the cameras and often affect individual pixels or
columns. This is very different from astrophysical sources,
which are convolved by the point-spread function (PSF) of the
telescope in all cameras. The screening process up to this point
reduces the number of X-ray transients to around 600.

2.2. Source Classiﬁcation

The ﬁnal step is to separate the extragalactic transients from
Galactic foreground sources and artifacts. This separation
essentially ﬁnds all SBO candidates, since SBOs are required to
be associated with galaxies. The remaining non-SBO transients
are primarily ﬂaring dwarf stars that lack parallax in Gaia and
are not identiﬁed in SIMBAD, or instrumental artifacts that are
difﬁcult to identify in time-integrated images. To perform this
ﬁnal selection, we use time-resolved spectra and images.
Additionally, we search all catalogs available at VizieR
(Ochsenbein et al. 2000) and inspect available sky images of
the source position (primarily X-rays, optical, and near-
infrared; NIR). We primarily use all HiPS sky images available
through CDS/Aladin (Bonnarel et al. 2000; Boch & Fernique
2014), but also check for data in MAST, ESO Portal, and
HEASARC in some cases. All objects that show clear signs of
being instrumental, Galactic, or persistent are discarded.

Note. Candidates are listed in descending order of conﬁdence of being an SN SBO. The same ordering is used throughout the paper. The last four candidates may be
misidentiﬁed Galactic foreground sources (Section 8.1). We provide celestial coordinates in both the equatorial (α, δ) and Galactic (l, b) systems. The parameter σ
refers to the astrometric uncertainty and the last column provides the start times of the transients in UTC.

We separate stars from galaxies using the optical and NIR
images. The primary data used for host classiﬁcation are from
Pan-STARRS (Chambers et al. 2016), DES (Abbott et al.
2018), and SkyMapper (Wolf et al. 2018). We use morpho-
logical classiﬁers to identify extended sources (galaxies),3 as
well as stellaricity catalogs (McMahon et al. 2013; Tachibana
& Miller 2018). However, since we are interested in accurate
classiﬁers of a few objects, we largely rely on visual inspection
of available data for each object. The manual classiﬁcation of
sources generally agrees with automatic
and objective
classiﬁers, but allows us to identify rare cases, such as likely
misclassiﬁcations due to blending of neighboring stars.

All objects that are possible SN SBOs are added to the ﬁnal
sample. This decision is based on the light curve shape,
duration, spectral shape, and the probability that the source is
extragalactic based on available information. Furthermore, we
require that the initial rise and a substantial part of the decay is
contained within the observation. We discard sources that show
persistent emission that appears associated with the transient
before the initial rise, which would indicate that the source is a
ﬂaring persistent source. We do not discard any transients
because they are too short. This means that the lower limit is
effectively set by the temporal resolution of XMM-Newton,
which is on the order of 100 ms for the most common
observing modes. We also do not discard any transients
because they are too long, but they are indirectly limited by the
requirement of rising and decaying within the exposure time
(typically 10–130 ks). We do not use quantitative requirements
at this last stage because of the difﬁculty of strictly deﬁning the
acceptable properties.

We verify completeness of the search by inspecting the
100,000 most variable light curves from 3XMM-DR8 by eye to
look for
transients that were potentially missed by the
algorithms, and ﬁnd one additional faint candidate. The level
of variability in this context is measured by a likelihood test
under the assumption that the light curve bin uncertainties are
Gaussian. Altogether, we ﬁnd 12 SN SBO candidates.
Identiﬁers of
the SN SBO candidates are provided in
Table 1. We designate each candidate by “XT” followed by

the date; the ﬁrst two numbers correspond to the year, the
second two numbers to the month, and the last two numbers to
the day (analogous to GRBs). We choose to present the SBO
candidates in descending order of conﬁdence (loosely deﬁned)
throughout this paper.

3. Host Galaxies

Table 2 provides key parameters for

the host galaxy
candidates associated with the 12 transients. For reference,
we also provide optical and NIR photometry of the hosts when
available, and limits otherwise,
in Table B1. Three of the
transients have no clearly identiﬁed host, and it is also possible
that
the observed hosts are Galactic objects
misclassiﬁed as galaxies. We discuss potential misidentiﬁca-
tions and alternative sources for
the X-ray transients in
Section 8. Throughout the rest of the paper, we assume that
the X-ray transients are SN SBOs.

some of

The most important parameter for the inferred properties of
the transients is the redshift (z). Some of the redshifts are highly
uncertain and we stress that this uncertainty propagates into
parameters that depend on z. This mainly applies to the
discussion of inferred SN properties in Section 7.2. In contrast,
the observed properties in Section 6 are largely independent of
z, with the only effect being an energy shift of the ﬁtted
temperature and host galaxy absorption. The magnitude of this
effect is relatively small (∝1+z) and does not qualitatively
alter the results.

To estimate the redshifts of the host galaxies, we primarily
rely on SED template ﬁtting. Photometric redshift techniques
are generally more reliable if the Balmer (4000 Å) or Lyman
(912 Å) break falls between two broad ﬁlters. This means that
the optical data (Table B1) is the most constraining for our
sources. Furthermore, we only use data from one survey (for
each object) to ensure that the photometry is homogeneous in
the sense that colors are correctly represented. For these
reasons, we exclude the NIR data from the SED ﬁtting
procedure. We are able to perform SED ﬁts to seven hosts,
whereas the remaining ﬁve either lacked an identiﬁed host or
multi-band optical data.

In addition to the SED ﬁtting, we also consider additional
independent information. The second most important constraint

Notes. Offset is the distance between the transient and the host galaxy. We note that the offsets are comparable to the uncertainties of the X-ray positions (Table 1).
Pgal is the probability of the source being a galaxy, based on morphology. These values are either from PS1-PSC (Pan-STARRS data, Tachibana & Miller 2018) or
VHS (VISTA data, McMahon et al. 2013). For convenience, we also provide the distance expressed as the distance modulus (μ), the angular scale, and the absolute
magnitude (M; in r-band unless otherwise noted). The “Galaxy” column provides tentative galaxy classiﬁers based on the SED ﬁtting; Sa, Sb, Sd, and Sbc are late-type
spirals, whereas SB denotes starburst galaxies.
a Fiducial redshifts of 0.3 are used when insufﬁcient information is available for a redshift estimate.
b These values are in the J-band because the r-band data is much shallower for these sources.

on z comes from the redshifts of neighboring galaxies. We
utilize this when the SED ﬁtting appears unreliable or if optical
data of the host is unavailable. After performing the SED ﬁts
and potentially including data from neighbors, we check if the
favored redshift implies a reasonable absolute magnitude and
radius for the galaxy (Blanton et al. 2003; Shen et al. 2003;
Wolf et al. 2003; Ilbert et al. 2005). We also compare the
distances with a reconstruction of the large-scale structure
(Lavaux et al. 2019, E. Tsaprazi 2020, private communication).
The reconstruction of the large-scale structure in the local
universe (out to z=∼0.1–1 depending on the line of sight)
provides a measure of density as a function of redshift along
the line of sight. This is effectively the likelihood of z relative
to the large-scale structure. The inclusion of independent
constraints means that we do not always choose the SED ﬁt
with the lowest χ2 value, but rather analyze all data and adopt
the redshift that appears to be most consistent overall. Finally,
we note that the information from neighboring galaxies allows
us to estimate redshifts even if no host galaxy is directly
observed. This is only possible in some cases and is clearly
highly uncertain.

We use the Le PHARE code (Arnouts et al. 1999; Ilbert et al.
2006) to perform the SED ﬁtting. The package includes a
number of different galaxy SED libraries. We try to ﬁt all
sources using the CWW-Kinney, AVEROIN, CFHTLS, and
COSMOS sets. Each set is ﬁtted independently to explore the
systematic error
introduced by choosing different SED
libraries. This also allows us to choose the SED that is most
consistent with the supplementary information. The CWW
library (Coleman et al. 1980) is based on four observed spectra
(Ell, Sbc, Scd, Irr) and is commonly used for photometric
redshift estimates. The CWW-Kinney sample extends the
CWW set with six starburst galaxies (Calzetti et al. 1994;
Kinney et al. 1996). Both the AVEROIN (Bruzual &
Charlot 2003; Arnouts et al. 2007) and CFHTLS (Ilbert et al.
2006) samples are essentially updated and reﬁned versions of
the CWW-Kinney sample. Finally,
the COSMOS sample
(Ilbert et al. 2009) is based on more recent SEDs of three

4

ellipticals and six spirals (S0, Sa, Sb, Sc, Sd, Sdm, Polletta
et al. 2007), as well as 12 starbursts (Bruzual & Charlot 2003).
We conclude this section with brief notes on the redshift of

individual objects.

1. Both XT161028 (z=0.29) and 151219 (z=0.62) have

(Ahumada et al. 2019). We choose to adopt the SDSS
values, which are very similar to the values obtained
using our redshift estimation method (0.28 and 0.66,
respectively). This choice does not affect the results and
facilitates comparisons with other works that rely on
SDSS redshifts. XT151219 also has redshift estimates of
0.67 (Kuijken et al. 2019) and 0.68 (Wright et al. 2019)
using combined data from KiDS and VIKING, 0.27 (de
Jong et al. 2017) using only KiDS, and 0.61 from the Hyper
Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (Nishizawa et al.
2020). Large errors for a small fraction of photometric
redshift estimates are common, which we believe explains
the deviating value of 0.27.

The former has a photometric redshift of 0.097 (Dalya

Furthermore, the SED captures the Balmer break well,
which no other SED type does adequately. This lends
conﬁdence to the photometric redshift and we take

circles with 1σ radii). The green lines mark the candidate host galaxies. The bottom texts are the sources of the images, which are all from HiPS except for VISTA and
Subaru data. The color scales are arbitrary and are chosen to maximize contrast. The image colors loosely represent source colors for multi-band data. All images are
1×1 arcmin2 and the lines pointing to the galaxies are 3″. North is up and east is left. Middle column: combined EPIC light curves in the observed 0.3–10 keV range.
Blue lines are binned light curves with light blue uncertainties, and orange lines are smoothed light curves (bin sizes and kernel widths are given in the legends). The
dashed green lines show the separation into ﬁrst and second halves for the time-resolved spectral analysis. The gray regions show the typical timescales (tR/c;
Section 7.1). The black crosses are the peak ﬂuxes (Section 4) and the horizontal black lines (lower left and right corners, barely visible in some cases) are the ﬂux
limits (Table 3). Right column: upper segments show the observed time-integrated spectra (black crosses) ﬁtted with the absorbed blackbody (blue) and power-law
(orange) models. Lower segments show the residuals normalized by the uncertainties using the same colors as above for the respective models. For visual clarity, we
combine all EPIC data and bin to 12 energy bins logarithmically.

(Figure 1). We assume that all three sources are located at
the same redshift and perform SED ﬁts to the two bright
galaxies. Reasonable agreement is achieved for z=0.37,
which we take as the estimate for XT070618 despite the
uncertainties.

very faint host, whereas a much higher redshift would
imply an extreme X-ray transient. However, we stress

and 16.5, respectively, at distances of 63″ (146 kpc) at
z=0.10 and 71″ (166 kpc) at z=0.16. These two
redshifts are photometric redshifts from the GLADE
catalog (Dalya et al. 2016). We adopt a redshift of 0.13
for XT100424 (implicitly for all three galaxies) based on
the combined information.

7. XT151128 has acceptable SED ﬁts for redshifts in the
range 0.2–0.65. The best ﬁt is around 0.48, which we
adopt as the favored redshift.

8. We also use the ﬁducial value of z=0.3 for XT050925
and 160220. In contrast to XT060207, there are NIR
these sources and z=0.3 results in

photometric redshifts from SDSS12 (Alam et al. 2015) of
eight neighboring galaxies within 20″ (123 kpc). The
average redshift is 0.5 with a standard deviation of 0.17.
We take z=0.5 as the redshift of XT040610 despite the
large uncertainties.

4. Observations and Data Reduction

We perform data reduction of all selected sources (Table 1)
largely following standard procedures. This data reduction is
independent of the automatic processing used for ﬁnding the
transients (Appendix A). We use XMM-Newton Science
Analysis System (SAS) version 18.0.0 (Gabriel et al. 2004)

6

The Astrophysical Journal, 896:39 (23pp), 2020 June 10

and the latest CCF as of 2019 December 11. We inspect the
images from the Optical Monitor (Mason et al. 2001) on board
XMM-Newton when available, but ﬁnd no variable emission
that appears connected with the X-ray transients. Henceforth,
we only consider data from the European Photon Imaging
Camera (EPIC). All 12 sources are covered by pn and MOS2,
while 8 sources are covered by MOS1 since part of its FoV has
been disabled.

We apply the latest calibration using the tasks epproc and
emproc. We also apply ﬁlters to keep data only in the range
0.3–10 keV with standard ﬁltering parameters. We select
temporary source regions and ﬁnal background regions by
hand. The background regions typically have radii of ∼1′ and
are selected to be close to the source, free of other sources, and

on the same CCD chip as the source. We use these source and
background regions to construct preliminary light curves.

Next, we deﬁne ﬁve time intervals: before, during, after, and
the ﬁrst and second halves of the transient. The halves of the
transient are deﬁned to have approximately equal ﬂuences.
These two halves are only used for time-resolved spectral
analysis (Section 5). All time intervals are deﬁned by eye based
on inspections of the preliminary source light curves.

We remove periods of high background before and after the
deﬁned duration of the transient following standard procedures.
The background levels during the transients are not high
enough to signiﬁcantly affect the analysis. Only XT110621
occurs during a high background interval, but is still clearly
detected with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 5. The median

S/N across all sources is 7, where the longer transients
contribute to a lower ratio. We note that the S/N only includes
the photon number statistics and does not
the
detection statistic, which also includes the spatial information.
The lowest detection statistic, as deﬁned by emldetect
(Watson et al. 2009), is 20 for XT151128. This approximately
corresponds to a false detection probability of 2×10−9.

represent

With the time intervals, it is possible to obtain an improved
estimate of the source position by ﬁtting to the image created from
the duration of the transient. We use the SAS task edetect_ch-
ain to ﬁt for the position in the 0.3–10 keV range in all cameras
simultaneously. We add in quadrature, a systematic uncertainty of
1 24, to the statistical uncertainty from edetect_chain, to

obtain the ﬁnal position uncertainty. We adopt this position as
the ﬁnal source position and create the ﬁnal source regions. The
radii for these regions are chosen to maximize the S/N, which
is computed by the SAS task eregionanalyse.

The next step of the data preparation is to create a light curve
using the updated source region, and create images and extract
spectra during each of the ﬁve time intervals. The light curve
and images are created following standard XMM-Newton data
reduction procedures. We largely follow standards when
extracting the spectra as well. However, we group all source
spectra to at least 1 count per spectral bin, which is necessary
for using C-stat in XSPEC.5 The ancillary response ﬁles and

response matrix ﬁles for the individual cameras are generated
using the SAS tasks arfgen and rmfgen, respectively.
Solely for presentation purposes, we also combine the spectra
from the three cameras using especcombine. The individual
spectra used for the merged EPIC spectra are binned using a
common channel grid corresponding to uniform bins of width
0.2 keV.

To determine upper limits on the source ﬂux during the time
intervals before and after the transient, we use the SAS task
esensmap. The task computes the photon ﬂux required for a
hypothetical source to be detected in the combination of all
three instruments. To convert the photon ﬂux to physical units,
we use the best-ﬁt model of the time-averaged spectrum
(Section 5). For the upper limits, we choose a detection
threshold (DET_ML) of 5.9, which corresponds to a chance
probability for detection of 2.7×10−3 (3σ) under the null
hypothesis.

To estimate the peak ﬂux of each transient, we start by
ﬁnding the shortest time interval during which 25% of all
source photons are detected. This is done by searching a
combined EPIC source event list. Having determined the time
interval with the highest photon ﬂux, we use epiclccorr to
apply all corrections to obtain the corrected count rate with
error bars. This task is usually used to produce light curves,
whereas we use it here to compute a count rate during a single
time interval. This is performed on the cameras individually,
with the single-bin time interval provided as input. The ﬁnal
step is to convert the peak count rates from epiclccorr to
ﬂuxes. We do this by scaling the ﬂuxes obtained from the time-
integrated spectral ﬁts (Section 5) by the ratio of the peak to the
time-averaged photon count rate.

it

transient.

is possible that

When the ﬂux is high,

two incident,
spatially close photons are interpreted incorrectly. They could
be detected as a single photon with higher energy or ﬂagged as
bad, a phenomenon referred to as pile-up. There is some
potential
for pile-up during the brightest phases of our
transients. XT070618 is the most likely to suffer from pile-
up, with a peak count rate of 0.4 photons per frame in the pn
CCD. The standard SAS method used for assessing pile-up,
epatplot,
is inconclusive because too few photons are
detected during the short
Instead, we manually
inspect the raw (ODF), calibrated (unﬁltered), and ﬁnal event
lists and ﬁnd no signs of suspected pile-up events. All light
curves are practically identical, including the marginal double-
peaked shape (Section 6).

Finally, we comment on the ﬂux of the object XT151219. It
is close to (but not on) a chip gap on the pn CCD. A part of the
standard procedure when creating pn spectra is to reject events
close to chip gaps (FLAG==0). This is performed because of
energy calibration uncertainties for events not completely
contained on the chip. For this object, this means rejecting
∼20% of the pn events. The spectral shape is unaffected, but
the overall ﬂux is likely underestimated by ∼15% (the source is
covered by both pn and MOS2). This does not affect any
conclusions qualitatively and we do not attempt to correct
for it.

5. Spectral Fitting

We ﬁt

two simple models to the data: a blackbody
(zbbody) and power-law (zpowerlw) model. Both models
also include an absorption component for the Milky Way
absorption (tbabs, Wilms et al. 2000) and a redshifted

Alp & Larsson
absorption component (ztbabs) representing host galaxy
absorption. The Milky Way column density is frozen to the
weighted estimate of Willingale et al. (2013), whereas the
redshifted column densities are ﬁtted for. Both absorption
components use the abundances of Wilms et al. (2000) and
cross sections of Verner & Yakovlev (1995).

We freeze the redshifts to our estimated values (Table 2) and
ignore the uncertainties that are implicitly introduced. The
redshifts only have a minor impact on the ﬁtted parameters
(Section 6) but have signiﬁcant
implications for the inferred
physical properties, which are discussed separately (Section 7.2).
The blackbody model is a simpliﬁed representation of a
complete physical model for the time-integrated spectrum of an
SN SBO (Section 7.1). The integrated spectra of SBOs are not
expected to be perfectly thermal, but a blackbody is a
reasonable approximation given the large uncertainties. Sapir
et al. (2013) showed that the time-integrated spectrum of an
peak, where hνpeak is the photon
SBO peaks at
the spectral peak (measured in ﬂuence per
energy at
logarithmic frequency; νFν) and Tpeak is the peak surface
temperature. In comparison, the spectral peak of a blackbody of
temperature T peaks at hνpeak=2.82T. Therefore, the ﬁtted
temperature is a reasonable approximation of the peak surface
temperature.

The interpretation of the power-law model is simpler than
the interpretation of the blackbody because we only use the
power law as a phenomenological model. Its purpose is to
quantify the observed spectral slope by ﬁtting for the photon
index (Γ). Moreover,
is also used for
comparisons with the blackbody model.

the goodness of ﬁt

We also ﬁt the blackbody and power-law models to the
spectra from the ﬁrst and second halves of the transients.
However, since the aim is to solely quantify spectral evolution,
the host absorptions are frozen to the best-ﬁt values from the
time-integrated ﬁts. This assumes that all information about the
evolution of the spectral shape is captured by the temperature
or photon index.

5.1. Technical Aspects

We use XSPEC version 12.10.1f (Arnaud 1996) for the
spectral analysis. The spectra are ﬁtted simultaneously to data
from all three EPIC CCDs in the entire 0.3–10 keV range. We
do not
introduce a free cross-normalization between the
instruments. The relative calibration of the instruments are
accurate to within 5%–10% (Madsen et al. 2017; Plucinsky
et al. 2017), but additional
free constants between the
instruments cannot be reliably constrained in a few cases of
extremely few counts. The analysis is performed with the C-stat
ﬁt statistic (Cash 1979) in XSPEC, which is the W statistic
when a Poissonian background is included.6

for

Conﬁdence intervals

the parameter estimates are
computed using the error command in XSPEC, which varies
the ﬁt parameters until the change in ﬁt statistic reaches a given
threshold. This assumes that the difference in ﬁt statistic is
2 for q degrees of freedom. This is a reasonable
distributed as cq
approximation even for Poissonian data except for a small
(Cash 1979;
additive correction µ -n 1 2
Yaqoob 1998). For the time-integrated ﬁts, there are three free
parameters. An appropriate threshold for 1σ conﬁdence

for

intervals and three independent parameters is a change in ﬁt
statistic of 3.5 (Avni 1976; Cash 1976; Lampton et al. 1976).
Analogously,
the time-resolved ﬁts with two free
parameters, the corresponding value is 2.3. For reference, we
note that X-ray analyses commonly use a critical value of
2.706, which represents the 90% interval for one parameter of
interest.

The goodness of ﬁts are computed by simulating 1000
spectra using the fakeit command in XSPEC. The spectra
are simulated using the best-ﬁt model at the energy resolution
of the channels of the instruments. The faked spectra are then
grouped to at least 1 count per bin, analogously to the real data.
The models are then ﬁtted to these spectra. The ﬁnal goodness
measure is represented by the fraction of ﬁts to faked spectra
with better test statistic than ﬁts to the observed data. A good ﬁt
should on average result in a fraction of 0.5. For our purposes
and given the systematic uncertainties, we consider goodness
fractions relatively close to 1 as acceptable. The ﬁt statistics
and goodness measures for all ﬁts are provided in Table C1.

6. Observed Properties

Here, we report

the observed properties of

the SBO
candidates. These are practically independent of any modeling
uncertainties. The redshifts enter into the ﬁtted blackbody
temperature and host galaxy absorption, but do not affect these
values much. In Figure 1, we provide the sky images, light
curves, and spectra for all SBO candidates. The purpose of the
sky images is only to show the host galaxy candidates and the
neighboring sources relative to the X-ray transients. Properties
of the light curves and spectra are presented separately in
Sections 6.1 and 6.2, respectively.

6.1. Light Curves

The light curves in Figure 1 show the temporal evolutions of
the transients. We note the signiﬁcantly different durations and
timescales (Section 7.1) ranging from ∼30 to 10,000 s. All
transients show gradual rises that appear at least marginally
resolved, although quite steep in some cases. In particular, no
source shows a prompt (<10 s) rise followed by an immediate
decay. This has important
implications for interpreting the
origins of the transients, since some are characterized by sharp
rises (Section 8). We are not able to quantify the properties of
the decaying tails accurately, since all transients quickly fade
below the detection limits. Dividing the light curves into
different energy bands is limited by the number of photons, and
does not reveal any signiﬁcant behavior that is not captured by
the time-resolved spectra (Section 6.2). Finally, we note in
passing an apparent, curious double-peak structure in the light
curves of XT070618 and 060207. We do not consider this
further since it appears statistically marginal, but a clearly
double-peaked X-ray transient has previously been reported by
Jonker et al. (2013).

The average ﬂuxes, peak ﬂuxes, and constraints before and
after the transients are provided in Table 3 (with the peak ﬂuxes
determined as described in Section 4). This shows that the
transients have large dynamic ranges of at least 10 in all cases
and substantially higher in many cases. The constraints on the
dynamic ranges are primarily limited by the telescope
sensitivity.

For

two of

the transients, we ﬁnd some evidence for
emission outside the main transient event. This is the case for

Alp & Larsson
XT161028, which is marginally detected after the main event.
This is likely the decaying tail that extends beyond the selected
time interval used to deﬁne the duration. No sub-threshold
source is present before the transient and the limit indicates that
any emission was lower than the marginal detection after. We
also ﬁnd no indications of a source in two XMM-Newton
observations7 14yr before the transient.

XT151219 shows a marginal quiescent ﬂux level before
the transient. XMM-Newton observed this position 7months
before and 18months after the transient.8 The last observation
marginally detects a ﬂux level roughly half (consistent within
uncertainties) of the level seen just before the transient. We
interpret this as quiescent X-ray emission from an underlying
active galactic nucleus. Using the ﬂux measured just before the
transient, the inferred 0.3–10 keV luminosity is (1.4±0.4)×
erg s 1 for z=0.62. No emission is detected in the
1043
earliest observation and just after the transient in the main
observation. This is likely due to the limited sensitivity and
inspections of the images reveal a sub-threshold source present
in both cases.

6.2. Spectra

The time-integrated spectral ﬁts are shown in Figure 1 and
the parameters from all ﬁts are provided in Table 4, including
the time-resolved ﬁts. Statistical measures of all ﬁts are
provided in Table C1. All ﬁts are acceptable, although there
are indications that some spectral features are not properly
captured by the simple models. We do not attempt to ﬁt more
complicated models due to the data quality and modeling
uncertainties. Additionally, the sources likely evolve in time,
which could introduce apparent spectral features in the time-
integrated spectra.

All transients are soft but show a range of different color
temperatures in the range 0.1–1 keV, or alternatively, photon
indices of 2–4. We note that there is an observational bias
toward soft sources due to the instrumental characteristics of
XMM-Newton and the detection statistic, which scales with the
number of photons rather than ﬂuence. The time-resolved ﬁts
show that the evolutions generally go from harder to softer,
although the signiﬁcance is marginal in some cases. No source
shows any signiﬁcant hardening.

Overall, the power-law model seems to result in slightly
better ﬁts. It is possible that this is due to a stronger degeneracy
between the photon index and host absorption than between the
temperature and host absorption. This behavior can be seen
from the ﬁtted host absorption column densities, which
generally are lower for the blackbody model than the power-
law model. We do not attempt to evaluate if the blackbody or
the power-law model is more reliable in this respect. This
would require assuming an underlying SBO model, modeling
the absorption of galaxies, and computing the survey
sensitivity, which is beyond the scope of this paper. We
simply conclude that the photon indices might be unreliable
and that the degeneracy can result in apparently better ﬁts when
compared to the blackbody model. Any uncertainties in the
photon indices do not affect our conclusions signiﬁcantly since
they are not used for inferring physical parameters.

7. SBO Interpretation

inferring physical parameters

In this section, we outline the SBO model (Section 7.1) used
for
from the observables
(Section 7.2). We then discuss the effects of asymmetries
(Section 7.3) and CSM (Section 7.4), which are not
incorporated into the model. We conclude by commenting on
the individual SBO candidates and how the observations
compare to theory (Section 7.5).

7.1. SBO Model

We use a model for SN SBOs to connect the observed
properties to physical parameters of the SN and its progenitor.
The aim is to infer the shock velocity (vsh), progenitor radius
(R), breakout density (ρ), and ejecta velocity (vej). The ejecta
velocity is the typical bulk velocity deﬁned as

=v

where Eexp is the SN explosion energy and Mej the ejecta mass.
The observed parameters that constrain these properties are the
bolometric SBO energy (ESBO) and color temperature (T).
Here, we closely follow the summary of SN SBO theory by
Waxman & Katz (2017). For simplicity, we consider the non-
relativistic regime even though BSGs are expected to be in the
transitional region (∼0.1c) and possibly be mildly relativistic in
some cases. Non-relativistic SBOs are also more accurately
modeled from a theoretical perspective. More detailed SBO
modeling is not motivated due to the limited data and
uncertainties in the redshifts.

The bolometric SBO energy is given by Equation (31) of

Note. Timescales (tR c) are deﬁned by hand (Section 7.1) and are given in the observer frame. The redshift correction is applied when computing the radius

. The luminosities and energies are bolometric. The parameters Lpeak and ESBO are observational and do not rely on the SBO modeling. The intervals

for Lpeak and ESBO only represent the X-ray ﬁtting uncertainties and do not include the redshift uncertainties. The large uncertainties for XT151128 are due to a
combination of few photons and a low lower temperature limit. We refrain from estimating the uncertainties for the remaining parameters since they include
uncertainties in the redshifts as well as the SBO modeling, which are difﬁcult to quantify (Sections 3 and 7.1).

The observed data are not able to constrain all parameters, in
particular those that the observables are relatively insensitive
to. Therefore, we take some values based on SN1987A
because SBOs should be most easily detectable from BSGs
similar to SN1987A (Sapir et al. 2013; Sapir & Halbertal 2014;
Waxman & Katz 2017). Speciﬁcally, we assume Mej=15
☉M
(Alp et al. 2019; Menon et al. 2019; Utrobin et al. 2019),
Lå=150,000 ☉L (Woosley et al. 1987), and a H-rich surface
composition of X=0.7 and Y=0.3. To illustrate the weak
dependence on these parameters, we note that choosing a

12

H-poor star with a factor of 10 lower Mej and a factor of 10
higher Lå only changes R by a factor of 0.83, vsh by 0.86, ρ by
4.0, and vej by 1.7. With the ﬁducial SN1987A values,
Equations (2), (3), (5), and (6) form a system of equations with
4 unknowns. The solution process can be simpliﬁed by solving
Equation (3) for vej, inserting it into Equation (6), and using
Equation (2) to express ρ in terms of ESBO, which results in

In addition to the constraint on R from the model above, an
independent constraint can be placed based on the light curve.
The light curve shape is initially determined by the light travel
time from different parts of the progenitor. The light curve rises

7.2. Inferred SN Properties

Here, we use the model outlined above to infer physical SN
parameters, which are provided in Table 5. The table includes
values that are derived using both the energetics and the light
curve shape. The primary goal is to determine if the obtained
parameters are consistent with typical SN SBO values. This is
mainly relying on comparisons with theoretical predictions due
to the lack of observations. We do not attempt to model and
propagate all uncertainties into these parameters. However, we

uncertainties are large. More detailed analyses of the transients
require spectroscopic redshifts and will be the subject of future
studies.

that both the redshift

From the light curves (Figure 1), we deﬁne the typical
timescales by hand, as described above. We denote radii

The Astrophysical Journal, 896:39 (23pp), 2020 June 10

determined using this method Rt to distinguish Rt from the radii
inferred from the energetics, which we denote RE.

The peak luminosities (Lpeak) and total SBO energies (ESBO)
rely on the redshift estimates and extrapolations of the spectra.
We use the time-integrated best-ﬁt blackbody models to
extrapolate from the observed 0.3–10 keV range to obtain the
bolometric quantities. For the typical best-ﬁt temperatures of
∼0.4 keV,
the 0.3–10 keV range already captures the vast
majority of the bolometric ﬂux. The time-averaged luminosities
obtained from the ﬁts are scaled to the light curve peaks using
the peak-to-average ﬂux ratio (Section 4; Table 3). Having
computed the energy ESBO, it is straightforward to solve for the
remaining parameters (Section 7.1). Finally, we note that Lpeak
is more uncertain than ESBO, both from an observational and
theoretical perspective. Therefore, we focus on ESBO for the
current analysis and provide Lpeak solely for comparisons with
other X-ray transients in general.

The parameter values in Table 5 are in reasonable agreement
with predictions for SN SBOs. For reference, we compute the
expected values for a SBO similar to SN1987A. In addition to
the assumed values in Section 7.1, we complete the model by
taking R=40 ☉R and Eexp=1.5×1051 erg (McCray 1993).
=
For this set of parameters, the derived properties are:
1046 erg, vsh=23,000km s−1, vej=1800km s−1, and
´4.0
ρ=1.7×10−9 gcm−3.

ESBO

The values for ESBO, RE, ρ, and Eexp are generally within an
order of magnitude of
the predicted values. These are
dependent and primarily show that the observed ESBO, and to
a lesser extent T, are within the range of predictions for SBOs.
Estimates of vsh and vej are more closely clustered around
20,000km s−1 and 2000km s−1, respectively. This is expected
because the velocities are mainly constrained by, and quite
insensitive to, T through Equations (3) and(5). This implies
that most soft spectra would result in reasonable vsh and vej.
Furthermore,
there is a strong observational bias against
detecting objects cooler than 0.1 keV because of the lower
0.3 keV energy limit of XMM-Newton and ISM absorption.

It is worth pointing out that the independent estimates of R
are within a factor of ∼2 for 5 of the sources. These two
estimates are completely independent and lend some strength to
the SBO interpretation. The remaining objects all have
substantially larger Rt than RE. This is a consequence of the
observed timescale being longer than the expected timescale.
Possible reasons for longer timescales are asymmetries and
dense CSM structures, as discussed below.

7.3. Asymmetries

Strong asymmetries in core-collapse SNe are predicted from
theory (Janka et al. 2016; Müller 2016; Couch 2017) and
clearly supported by observations (Larsson et al. 2016; Abellán
et al. 2017; Grefenstette et al. 2017). Asymmetric SBOs have
been studied (Suzuki & Shigeyama 2010; Couch et al. 2011),
but have relied on bimodal, jet-like, two-dimensional axisym-
metric explosions. These asymmetries were introduced by hand
but showed that asymmetries could contribute to longer
timescales and signiﬁcantly affect the light curve shape. To
ﬁrst order, the asymmetries only affect when the shock reaches
the surface. The minor differences in shock velocity and
breakout angle should have much smaller effects on the SBO
properties. This means that only the light curve shape should be
affected by the asymmetries.

Alp & Larsson
More recently, Wongwathanarat et al. (2015) performed self-
consistent three-dimensional neutrino-driven SN simulations to
late times past SBO (Figure 14 of Wongwathanarat et al. 2015).
They used a set of RSG and BSG single-star progenitors and
have now also studied BSGs that are the results of binary
mergers (Menon & Heger 2017; A. Wongwathanarat 2020,
private communication). Although these simulations do not
compute the SBO emission,
they track the shock as it
propagates through the star and breaks the surface. For the
single-star BSG progenitor B15, the time difference between
the ﬁrst and last parts of the shock breaking the surface is
approximately 200 s. This is a relatively spherical model. The
BSG merger progenitors are more asymmetric and show time
differences of ∼1000 s. These values can be compared to the
times required for the shock to propagate through the stars of
4500–7500 s. For W15, which is a relatively asymmetric RSG,
the fastest shock breaks out at ∼70,000 s and the slowest at
∼83,000 s post-bounce.

We emphasize that these asymmetries are not introduced by
hand and develop spontaneously during the explosion from
initial seed perturbations. This implies that asymmetries are
expected to develop even for spherical progenitors. It is also
worth pointing out that aspherical SBOs could both shorten or
lengthen the observed timescale, depending on the viewing
angle.

To summarize, it is likely that asymmetric shocks develop
during the core-collapse process. These asymmetries signiﬁ-
cantly affect the duration and light curve shape of the observed
SBO. We tentatively conclude that asymmetries can introduce
time variations of up to 20% of the shock crossing time of the
star, which is an order of magnitude longer than the light-
crossing time R/c in extreme cases. The effects of asymmetries
on the timescale are sufﬁcient to reduce the tensions between Rt
and RE in the cases where they are signiﬁcantly different.

7.4. Circumstellar Medium

150 s

»t
R c

The CSM affects the SBO emission if the optical depth of
the CSM is larger than c/vsh. In these cases, the shock does not
break out at the surface, but instead propagates into the CSM.
A notable example is the initial X-ray transient associated with
SN2008D (Soderberg et al. 2008), which is particularly
interesting because of similarities with some of our SBO
the SN2008D SBO had a peak

erg s 1, total energy of 6×1045 erg, a
luminosity of 4×1043
-
, and a Γ≈2 power-law spectrum
timescale of
(Modjaz et al. 2009). A thermal spectrum with a temperature of
0.75 keV ﬁts the data worse but is still statistically acceptable.
From these values and using our methods, we would infer
Rt=65 ☉R and RE=11 ☉R .

A common interpretation of the SN2008D X-ray transient is
a SBO from the explosion of a WR star surrounded by a thick
wind (Chevalier & Fransson 2008; Balberg & Loeb 2011;
Svirski & Nakar 2014). CSM SBOs are also often used to
explain observations of TypeIIn and super-luminous SNe
(Section 6.1 of Waxman & Katz 2017 and references therein).
However, these SBOs are very different and are not expected to
appear as X-ray transients on timescales that our searches are
sensitive to.

We do not attempt to explore the effects of a dense CSM in
detail due to the wide range of possible scenarios and the
observational uncertainties. Instead, we simply note that a

13

The Astrophysical Journal, 896:39 (23pp), 2020 June 10

dense CSM could increase the timescale and that some of our
candidates are similar to SN2008D.

7.5. Notes on Individual Objects

Even though the inferred parameters (Table 5) agree
reasonably well with theoretical predictions, there are some
aspects that cause tensions with a clean SBO interpretation. In
light of the discussions of asymmetries and effects of the CSM,
we provide more detailed comments on individual objects
below.

1. The ﬁrst two objects, XT161028 and 151219, agree very
well with BSG SBO predictions. The derived quantities
are close to ﬁducial SBO values under the assumptions of
spherical symmetry and thin CSM. The only parameter
that stands out is ESBO for XT161028, which is an order
of magnitude lower than the reference value. Given the
uncertainties, we do not consider this to be a major
problem and conclude that both objects are strong SN
SBO candidates.

2. All properties of XT1106219 agree well with predictions
for BSG SBOs, except for the timescale. This can be seen
from the discrepancy between Rt=150 and RE=14.
One possible explanation for the longer observed time-
scale is an asymmetric BSG SBO. Another possibility is
an SBO from a WR with a dense wind, similar to the
SN2008D SBO. They both have practically the same
peak luminosities and total energies, although the light
curve shapes are slightly different and XT110621 has a
softer spectrum. Given the expected variances in light
curves and spectra, a similar origin for XT110621 is
possible. We are not able to distinguish between an
asymmetric BSG SBO and a dense CSM WR SBO, but
conclude that both are possible origins.

3. XT030206 is the most energetic object and would
require extreme SN parameters. Interestingly, the inferred
Eexp of 6×1051 erg is in the range of (7.1±5.4)×1051
erg typical of TypeIc-BL SNe (Taddia et al. 2019). Our
modeling does not strictly apply to these SNe and any
ﬁrm conclusions would
analysis
(Section 8.2).

4. Both XT070618 and 060207 agree well with the BSG
SBO interpretation. The main uncertainty for
these
objects is due to the lack of host detections. This implies
that the redshift estimates are highly uncertain, which
propagates into all inferred parameters.

5. XT100424 and 151128 are the coolest objects and are
much slower than expected for typical SBOs from BSGs.
The observed properties suggest that they might instead
be associated with SBOs from RSGs. A less-explored
possibility is SBOs from yellow supergiants (Smartt 2009;
Ergon et al. 2014), which in the current context
effectively is an intermediate class between RSGs and
BSGs. The interpretations for these two objects are
mainly driven by the timescales and temperatures, which

discovery of XT110621 (EXMM 023135.0−603743 using their notation).
Importantly, they ﬁnd a spectroscopic redshift of 0.092 for the host galaxy
(compared to our value of 0.095), which eliminates much of the uncertainty for
our analysis of XT110621. Overall, their and our results and interpretations
agree very well with each other. There are minor differences in the spectral ﬁts,
which likely are due to a combination of different methods,
the high
background (Section 4), and the high host absorption.

are observationally reliable. The total energies are more
than an order of magnitude lower than predicted for RSG
SBOs, but are uncertain due to the observed energy range
relative to the temperatures, as well as the redshift
uncertainties. The transients are also hotter than RSG
SBO predictions, but this is anticipated because of the
very strong observational biases against
the cooler
majority of RSG SBOs. The timescales are also slightly
longer than expected, but
this can be alleviated by
invoking asymmetries.

6. The last four transients, XT050925, 160220, 140811,
and 040610 have longer timescales than expected for
BSG SBOs. They are all largely similar to XT110621
(and implicitly also the SN 2008D SBO) and the same
arguments apply to these four sources. The main
differences for these last four transients are the uncertain
host redshifts and the risk of being foreground contam-
ination (Section 8.1).

8. Alternative Explanations

In this section, we explore possible sources other than SNe
that could produce the observed transients. Section3 of Bauer
et al. (2017) provides a similar discussion with a slightly
different focus. They discuss CDF-SXT1, which suffers from
similar potential contaminants as our SBO candidates. The
most likely sources to be confused for SN SBOs are ﬂares from
Galactic late-type dwarfs (Section 8.1). We discuss GRBs as
potential sources in Section 8.2 and a number of less probable
sources in Section 8.3. We note that the predicted number of
SN SBOs (Sapir & Halbertal 2014; Waxman & Katz 2017) is
comparable to the number we observe, which lends strength to
the SBO interpretation.

8.1. Dwarf Stars

X-ray ﬂares from late-type dwarf stars (Güdel 2004; Güdel
& Nazé 2009; Benz & Güdel 2010) could potentially be
confused for SBO candidates, in cases where a host galaxy is
not clearly detected. The coolest object observed to ﬂare in
X-rays is an L1dwarf (de Luca et al. 2020). A qualitative
difference between SN SBOs and dwarf ﬂares is that dwarf
ﬂares are recurrent (and any dwarfs with multiple ﬂares would
already have been excluded from our sample). Faint ﬂares are
frequent and occur up to tens of times per day, while the rate of
the most powerful ﬂares are limited by the observed sample
size (Loyd et al. 2018a, 2018b).

The distribution of peak X-ray (0.3–10 keV) luminosities of
dwarf ﬂares extends to ∼1030
erg s 1 and decreases steeply
with peak ﬂux (Cook et al. 2014; Williams et al. 2014; Loyd
et al. 2018a, 2018b; de Luca et al. 2020). The effective
temperatures for the majority of the ﬂares are in the range
∼0.5–2 keV (Pallavicini et al. 1990; Robrade & Schmitt 2005;
Pye et al. 2015; de Luca et al. 2020). Typical timescales range
from a few hundred to a few thousand seconds, and the
dynamic ranges vary from a factor of 2 to more than 300
(Favata et al. 2000; Pandey & Singh 2008; Robrade et al. 2010;
Pye et al. 2015).

For our purposes, we focus on the extreme cases despite their
low rates. The 2014 April 23 ﬂare from DGCVn is the most
luminous observed Mdwarf ﬂare (Caballero-García et al.
2015; Osten et al. 2016). DGCVn is a binary system
composed of two M4Ve dwarfs with a combined absolute J-

band magnitude of 7.2magAB. The ﬂare reached a peak ﬂux of
3×1032
erg s 1 and the dominant ﬂare component evolved on
a timescale of ∼300 s. Another comparable event is the 2008
April 25 EVLac ﬂare (Osten et al. 2010). EVLac is an
M3.5Vdwarf with
of
8.5magAB. The X-ray ﬂare reached a peak ﬂux of 1032
erg s 1 and the dominant component evolved on a timescale of
∼300 s. However,
these events are very hard, with peak
temperatures of 25 keV (DG CVn) and 10 keV (EV Lac), and
even triggered the gamma-ray burst monitor Swift/BAT
(Barthelmy et al. 2005). The L1dwarf ﬂare reported by de
Luca et al. (2020) reached a peak ﬂux of 6.3×1029
-
erg s 1,
had a temperature of 1.4 keV, and evolved on timescales of
∼3ks. The absolute J-band magnitude of the L1dwarf is
12.8magAB. Finally, we note that Glennie et al. (2015) report a
tentative association of an X-ray transient with an L1dwarf.
The inferred peak luminosity is 7×1031
erg s 1; however,
both the spectral type and distance to the source are uncertain.
We can use the optical and NIR data (Table B1) to constrain
the distance to a potential dwarf star. This can be combined
with the peak X-ray ﬂuxes (Table 3) to infer a peak X-ray
luminosity if the source is a dwarf. For reference, the X-ray
luminosity expressed in terms of peak ﬂux (
peak
erg s−1 cm−2), apparent magnitude (m), and absolute magni-
tude (M) is

absolute magnitudes

The peak ﬂare ﬂux relative to absolute magnitude is
comparable for M and Ldwarfs. For the discussion, we adopt
of Mr=9magAB
ﬁducial
(Bochanski et al. 2011; Pecaut & Mamajek 2013) and
MJ=8magAB (Pecaut & Mamajek 2013; Carnero Rosell
et al. 2019), which are representative of an M4dwarf, and
similarly for an L1 dwarf: Mz=14.3magAB (Carnero Rosell
et al. 2019; de Luca et al. 2020) and MJ=13magAB.

For two of the three candidates without hosts, XT 070618
and XT 060207,
the inferred luminosities are orders of
magnitude higher than what have been observed from dwarf
stars. For the last candidate without a host, XT 040610, the
observations are marginally consistent with an L1dwarf
because of the weak NIR constraints. The strongest constraint
is in the z-band, which implies a peak luminosity of 6×1029
erg s 1 for a distance of 330pc. This is similar to the L1ﬂare
reported by de Luca et al. (2020).

-

We now turn our attention to the three last SBO candidates
with possible host associations: XT050925, 160220, and
140811. These have been classiﬁed as galaxies based on
morphology (Table 2) but are potentially blends of two point
sources,implying that the transient would be a ﬂare from one
of the foreground stars. By comparing the optical and NIR
photometry with X-ray data, we ﬁnd that all three are consistent
with being dwarf ﬂares for Mdwarfs at ∼3 kpc or Ldwarfs at
∼300 pc. However, this would require them to be among the
most luminous dwarf ﬂares for either spectral type. Further-
more, if these sources indeed consist of two blended sources,
then using the combined magnitude of the two sources as we
have done above would underestimate the true X-ray ﬂux.

Dust could, in principle, obscure the emission of an optical
source. However, this is challenging to reconcile with the H
column density through the Milky Way (Table 4, Willingale
et al. 2013). Furthermore, the observed X-ray spectra generally

Alp & Larsson
indicate very low levels of optical and NIR absorption (Predehl
& Schmitt 1995).

To summarize, it is possible that at least some of the bottom
four candidates: XT050925, 160220, 140811, and 040610, are
dwarf ﬂares. However, we are not able to ﬁrmly conclude this
without additional data.

8.2. Gamma-Ray Bursts

The prompt GRB phase evolves on timescales of 0.3 s for
short GRBs and 10 s for long GRBs (Meegan et al. 1996; von
Kienlin et al. 2020). The spectra typically peak at energies in
the range 100–1000 keV (Goldstein et al. 2012), and extend
into soft X-ray energies (Villasenor et al. 2005; Lien et al.
2016). Both types are followed by afterglows with luminosities
in the range 1047–1051
erg s 1 at 100 s that decay on timescales
of hours to days (Berger 2014; Bauer et al. 2017). The spectral
shape in the 0.3–10 keV range is a power law with photon
indices in the range ∼1.5–3 (Zhang et al. 2007; Racusin et al.
2009).

-

If

the SBO candidates are related to GRBs,

the peak
luminosities have to be much lower
than typical GRB
afterglows (Figure 4 of Bauer et al. 2017). For the candidates
with host galaxies, it is highly unlikely that the true redshifts
are substantially higher than estimated. The lack of a sharply
rising prompt phase, overall light curve shapes, and spectra are
also difﬁcult to reconcile with standard on-axis GRBs.

GRBs could potentially agree with some of our observations
if observed far off-axis. This applies to both short (Sun et al.
2019; Xue et al. 2019; Dado & Dar 2020) and long GRBs
(Dado & Dar 2019). The effects of a large viewing angle are
longer duration, much lower peak luminosity, lower spectral
peak, and lower ﬂuence. The models for off-axis GRBs can be
adjusted to agree qualitatively with our observations; however,
many model parameters are essentially unconstrained and can
be tuned to produce a very large range of observed timescales,
spectra, and energies.

Another source of emission is the hot cocoon, which is the
result of interactions between the jet and surrounding material.
This is produced in both short (Lazzati et al. 2017) and long
(Suzuki & Shigeyama 2013; de Colle et al. 2018) GRBs. The
predictions for both types are X-ray transients with peak
luminosities around 1046–1048
erg s 1 and fast rise times, with
the details being quite sensitive to the off-axis angle. Cocoon
emission from short GRBs is expected to evolve on timescales
of <30 s with temperatures of 0.2–2 keV. The corresponding
values for long GRBs are ∼100 s and ∼0.2 keV. We note that
these values agree reasonably well with the most luminous of
the observed transients, XT030206, particularly for a long
GRB cocoon.

8.3. Other Possibilities

There are other astrophysical sources that could give rise to
X-ray transients. Many of these are expected to also produce
persistent optical emission. Therefore, we note that the optical
constraints discussed in Section 8.1 (Equation (8)) are general
and apply to any type of object, such as a companion star in an
X-ray binary. It is also important to consider the Galactic
latitude of the SBO candidates (Table 1). Galactic objects are
generally conﬁned to the Galactic plane, except for objects that
are expected to be very close, such as late-type dwarfs.
Furthermore, the prior probability of a neutron star to align

15

with an extragalactic source is <1% for a neutron star solid
angle density of 1000deg−2 (Ofek 2009; Sartore et al. 2010).
Here, we very brieﬂy mention a number of potential sources
without exploring all details. We simply note that the following
classes are able to produce some, but not all, of the observables
without
requiring very rare
circumstances.

signiﬁcant ﬁne-tuning or

Tidal disruption events (Rees 1988; Phinney 1989) produce
soft X-ray transients that typically evolve on timescales of
10–300days (Komossa 2015; Kochanek 2016). This scenario
involves an ordinary star being accreted onto a supermassive
black hole, which also determines the timescale. This is much
longer than the SBO candidates, but disruptions of white
dwarfs by intermediate mass black holes have been suggested
to produce tidal disruption events on timescales of ∼10ks
(Fernández et al. 2019; Shen 2019; Maguire et al. 2020).

X-ray binaries (Nooraee 2013; Walter et al. 2015; Martínez-
Núñez et al. 2017) can produce a number of different types of
X-ray ﬂares. Type-I (thermonuclear) X-ray bursts (Galloway &
Keek 2017; Galloway et al. 2020) have peak luminosities of
∼3×1038
erg s 1 and evolve on timescales of 10–300 s, but
can extend up to several thousand seconds in some cases.
Ordinary accretion processes and type-II outbursts (van den
Eijnden et al. 2017) generally do not produce the high dynamic
ranges that characterize ﬂares. So-called supergiant fast X-ray
transients (Romano 2015; Ducci et al. 2019; Sguera et al. 2020)
are ∼3 ks ﬂares with dynamic ranges of ∼104 and peak
luminosities on the order of 1037
erg s 1, which are driven by
wind accretion from OB supergiant companions. Although
X-ray binaries can produce a range of X-ray transients, they are
necessarily associated with bright companions
that are
challenging to reconcile with our optical and NIR data.

White dwarf binaries (Mukai 2017) produce variable X-ray
emission through accretion and surface nuclear burning
(Schwarz et al. 2011; Morii et al. 2013; Starrﬁeld et al. 2016;
Ness 2019). They can produce very soft spectra and evolve on
short timescales, but typically do not ﬂare with sufﬁciently
large dynamic ranges to be confused with SN SBOs.

Magnetars (Mereghetti et al. 2015; Turolla et al. 2015; Kaspi
& Beloborodov 2017) are isolated neutron stars that are
characterized by very strong magnetic ﬁelds. They are known
to produce high-energy transient emission, most notably so-
called giant ﬂares (Hurley et al. 2005; Palmer et al. 2005).
These are much harder than the SBO candidates and have light
curves with a more prompt burst of ∼1 s followed by a much
fainter decaying tail, similar to short GRBs.

9. Summary and Conclusions

When a star undergoes core collapse, a shock is launched
from the core. This shock propagates through the star and when
it reaches the surface, a burst of soft X-rays is released. This is
the ﬁrst electromagnetic signal that escapes a core-collapse SN
and it carries independent information about the progenitor
radius, asymmetries, and ﬁnal mass-loss history. The X-ray
transients are characterized by total energies on the order of
1045–1047erg,
timescales of 10–1000 s, and soft spectra
corresponding to temperatures of 0.03–3 keV. These values
depend sensitively on the type of progenitor. RSGs generally
produce slower and cooler SBOs, BSG SBOs are intermediate,
and SBOs from WR progenitors are faster and hotter.

We search the XMM-Newton archive for serendipitously
observed SN SBOs. This archive is likely to contain more SN

Alp & Larsson

SBOs than any other because of the large effective area, large
FoV, and 20 yr lifetime of XMM-Newton. Our search results in
12 SN SBO candidates. They are all consistent with being
SBOs, but it is possible that a few are Galactic foreground
dwarf stars or produced by other types of extragalactic sources.
We focus on the SN SBO interpretation and investigate the
inferred physical properties. In addition to the X-ray data, we
analyze public wide-ﬁeld optical and NIR data and ﬁnd host
galaxy candidates for nine of the sources. We estimate host
redshifts of 0.1–0.6, except for one source at redshift 1.17.

The SBO candidates have energies on the order of 1046erg,
timescales ranging from minutes to hours, and soft spectra with
color temperatures of 0.1–1 keV. Using these observables, we
are able to infer progenitor and SN properties. Two candidates
are probably SBOs from BSGs. A third candidate is similar but
slightly slower, which could be interpreted as an asymmetric
BSG SBO or breakout from a wind surrounding a more
compact WR progenitor (similar to SN 2008D). There is one
transient with a total energy of 8×1047 erg, which is higher
than SBO predictions. This could potentially be the SBO from
an extreme SN. There are two more sources that are likely BSG
SBOs, but
lack host galaxy identiﬁcations and are more
uncertain. Two candidates appear to be extreme cases of RSG
or possibly yellow supergiant SBOs. Finally,
the last four
candidates could either be asymmetric BSG SBOs, WR wind
SBOs, or Galactic foreground contamination.

Many of the SBO candidates show signs of signiﬁcant
asymmetries or optically thick CSM. This is consistent with
both theory and other types of observations of core-collapse
SNe. Asymmetries arise spontaneously during the core-
collapse process and primarily affect
the timescale of the
SBO. We emphasize that this very naturally explains a broader
diversity in SBO durations (up to 20% of the shock crossing
time) than expected from spherical models. This additional
variance agrees well with our observations. The effect of CSM
on the SBO candidates is more difﬁcult to disentangle due to
the very large parameter space, which can give rise to a wide
range of observables. More detailed conclusions need further
modeling of the individual sources, deeper optical data, and
spectroscopic redshifts. Optical follow-up data of the SNe
would also ideally be obtained. This will be the subject of
future studies.

Future X-ray observations will detect an ever-increasing
number of SN SBOs. The X-ray instrument currently most
likely to detect SBOs is eROSITA (Predehl et al. 2010;
Predehl 2017). We predict eROSITA to detect 2 SN SBOs per
year using Equations (43) of Sapir et al. (2013) and(97) of
Waxman & Katz (2017). This is a back-of-the-envelope
estimate where we also attempt to correct for ISM absorption
and the diversity in observed properties. We conclude by
emphasizing the importance of live analyses of future X-ray
data and rapid follow-up observations to fully capitalize on
these rare opportunities.

Appendix A

Searching the XMM-Newton Observations

We use two different algorithms to search for SN SBOs in
archival XMM-Newton data. The aim of both search
algorithms is solely to identify X-ray transients. Rejecting
spurious detections and careful
source identiﬁcation is
performed in a subsequent stage (Section 2.2). For these
reasons, we do not attempt to correct for instrumental effects
such as vignetting, dead time, or chip gaps in the transient
detection process. Some details related to data preparation are
also not considered, such as extraction regions falling outside
of CCDs and nearby sources located within background
regions. These effects are managed in the proper data reduction
(Section 4) for the ﬁnal SBO candidates.

Notably, we do not exclude periods of high background
when searching for transients because transients can occur
during these times and could,
in principle, be securely
identiﬁed. The high background is produced by protons in
the Earth’s magnetosphere and depends on the satellite altitude
and level of solar activity (Carter & Read 2007). These proton
ﬂares affect 30%–40% of the total XMM-Newton observation
time. Excluding these time periods increases the S/N of typical
persistent sources, but this is not true for a transient source that
is only detectable during a background ﬂare. The challenge is
to distinguish an interesting astrophysical
from
background ﬂares. This distinction is difﬁcult to do solely
using light curves, but can easily be done in images because
background ﬂares affect
the CCDs uniformly whereas a
transient source appears as a point.

A.1. Custom Transient Source Finder

Our custom algorithm starts from the Processing Pipeline
Subsystem (PPS) event lists and ﬁnds all variable sources. We
use all 11,500 public observations with EPIC imaging archived
at HEASARC as of 2019 November 11. Since we are expecting
faint and soft sources, we combine the data from all EPIC
cameras (Strüder et al. 2001; Turner et al. 2001) and restrict the
energy range to 0.3–2 keV.

temporal dimension. The

The ﬁrst step of the search algorithm is to bin the event list
along the spatial and temporal dimensions. Effectively, this
creates a series of images (a data cube) for each observation ,
which is divided into three-dimensional “cells” with two spatial
and one
spatial binning is
20×20arcsec2, which is chosen to contain the cores of the
PSFs of EPIC. The encircled energy at a radius of 10″ is around
60% for EPIC. The PSF wings are much broader and can be
neglected. The temporal binning is performed at ﬁve different
timescales ranging from 100 to 10,000 s with logarithmic
spacing. To mitigate the effects of the discretizations in space
and time, we repeat the binning by shifting the grid by one-half
of the bin size along each dimension. The total number of
combinations introduced by the shifts and temporal binning at
different timescales is 40 (2×2×2×5). This means that 40
data cubes are created for each observation.

The second step is to ﬁnd transients in the data cubes. To do
this, we perform a simpliﬁed statistical test for variability in
each cell relative to the grid cells before and after. Before and
after in this context refers to the cells at the same spatial
position, but one bin earlier and later along the temporal
dimension, respectively. Importantly, the transient detection
algorithm must be able to handle the highly temporally varying
background and reject slowly varying sources. For each cell,
we ﬁrst need to estimate the expected persistent source ﬂux at
the position. This is done by linearly interpolating the
background-subtracted ﬂuxes of the cells before and after in
time. The background subtraction in the before and after cells
are performed by subtracting the average of the four spatially
neighboring grid cells at the respective times. To prevent over-
subtraction (negative counts), we simply force the expected
source ﬂux in the current bin to be at least 1 count. This
provides the expected persistent source ﬂux at
the current
position. To this ﬂux, we add the average background of the
four spatially neighboring pixels. This sum is the expected total
count rate in the current cell. Finally, we assume the count rate
to be Poissonian and compute the p value to obtain the
observed count rate given the expected rate. This pvalue should
capture any variability in excess of linear variability in time,
while also being insensitive to the highly temporally varying
background.

To separate the variable sources, we perform a cut based on
the variability measure. As a test statistic, we rescale the pvalue
and use the negative log-likelihood −ln(p). We select a limiting
statistic of 25, which leaves a very low probability of noise
passing the ﬁlter. This cut leaves 380 detections, which are
investigated by eye in subsequent steps.

A.2. Finding Transients in 3XMM-DR8

The XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre routinely pub-
lishes catalogs of detected sources, the latest being 3XMM-
DR8 at the time of writing. This catalog contains observations
from 2000 February 3 through 2017 November 30 and contains

17

The Astrophysical Journal, 896:39 (23pp), 2020 June 10

Alp & Larsson

775,153 detections of 531,454 unique sources. The ﬁrst step
toward identifying SBOs is analyzing the source light curves.
3XMM-DR8 includes light curves, but those are not suited for
fast transients because they were created with a common bin
width with a minimum number of photons in every bin
(Section 5.2 of Watson et al. 2009). Consequently, the time
interval before the rise of a transient source (and possibly also
after the transient has faded) results in an increased common
bin width. This increase could drastically reduce the sensitivity
for short, bright, ﬂare-like transients. For these reasons, we
decide to construct custom light curves for our SBO search.11
We use the positions from the 3XMM-DR8 catalog of identiﬁed
sources and generate light curves for all 550,614 detections that are
more than 15° outside of the Galactic plane. We do not search the
Galactic plane because we found no candidates in this region using
our custom ﬁnder and because robust source identiﬁcation is very
difﬁcult in dense ﬁelds. The increased X-ray absorption close to
the Galactic plane also drastically reduces the possibility of
detecting SBOs. Furthermore, we discard very faint sources by
omitting all objects with a detection likelihood reported by
3XMM-DR8 as less than 10. This likelihood is based on the
likelihood ratio described by Cash (1979). The likelihood is
deﬁned as
, where P is the probability of the detection
occurring by chance (formally,
the null
hypothesis; Section 4.4.3 of Watson et al. 2009).

the probability of

( )
- Pln

To create the light curves, we download the XMM-Newton
PPS event lists and combine all exposures of the EPIC pn,
MOS1, and MOS2 cameras within each observation and limit
the energy range to 0.3–10 keV. From the combined event list,
we extract source events from a circular region with a radius of
20″ centered on the source position (taken from 3XMM-DR8).
Background events are then extracted from an annular region
centered on the source with an inner radius 50″ and an outer
radius of 100″. The light curves are binned such that each bin
contains 25 counts from the source region. This binning
requirement ignores the background count rate and results in
bins with different temporal widths. The reason for choosing
this dynamic-binning approach is to be able to effectively
capture the large variations in ﬂux for transient sources. The
background events are binned to the same temporal bins as the
source light curves and are then subtracted from the source to
create a ﬁnal light curve.

The next step is to ﬁnd all transient sources. We identify
sources showing transient-like behavior by requiring that they
fulﬁll at least one of the following heuristics:

1. The ratio of the maximum background-subtracted ﬂux
bin over the 50th ﬂux percentile (i.e., percentile of the
bins weighted by time for this individual light curve) is
larger than 3, while the signal-to-background ratio (S/B)
is higher than 10 at the time of peak ﬂux.

2. Same as above, but with a peak ﬂux a factor of 5 above

the 50th percentile and an S/B of at least 3.

3. At least 10ks of the background-subtracted light curve is
within 1σ of 0counts s−1. Moreover, at least one bin has
a source ﬂux higher than 0.05counts s−1 with an S/B
higher than 3.

The combination of all heuristics is constructed to distinguish
ﬂare-like sources while being insensitive to background ﬂares
and inaccurate background subtraction. All heuristics are then
also reevaluated with the modiﬁcation that the time intervals
when the background count rate is higher than 0.05counts s−1
are discarded.12 Approximately 11,000 sources pass these
criteria and are investigated by eye at a subsequent stage. This
can be compared to 3XMM-DR8, which classiﬁes 5934
sources as variable. The difference in the number of variable
sources is not surprising because of our simpliﬁed background
treatment, which results in a very large number of sources
being classiﬁed as variable due to inaccurately subtracted
background ﬂares. Furthermore, these numbers are not strictly
comparable because we apply a number of ﬁlters and have
deﬁned variability differently.

Appendix B

Host Photometry

Table B1 provides the optical and NIR data for the candidate
host galaxies. The multi-band optical data are used for the
redshift SED ﬁtting. Speciﬁcally, we only use optical data from
a single survey for each source to avoid systematic uncertain-
ties between different surveys. It is not possible to perform
reliable SED ﬁts using only NIR data, but the NIR data are still
useful since they provide an important check for the inferred
absolute magnitudes.

11 We note that the Exploring the X-ray Transient and variable Sky (EXTraS)
project (de Luca et al. 2016) aim to provide more detailed temporal data
products for all XMM-Newton sources. However,
the EXTraS data for
aperiodic short-term variability (EXTraS Working Package 2) only includes
data that were publicly available by 2012 December 31 (corresponding to
3XMM-DR4). The EXTraS light curves are also intended for general variable
behavior and are not optimized for fast and possibly faint transients. For these
reasons, we only brieﬂy inspected the EXTraS WP2 catalog, and we ﬁnd no
objects that were not already detected by our other methods.

12 We note that the limit of 0.05counts s−1 refers to the rate of our custom
background light curves. These light curves are different from the background
light curves in the standard XMM-Newton data reduction, which are
customarily deﬁned as the total rate in the entire FoV within 10–12 keV for
the pn CCD and above 10 keV for the MOS CCDs.

Note. All magnitudes are converted (Hewett et al. 2006; Blanton & Roweis 2007) to the AB magnitude system (Oke & Gunn 1983). All detections use either Petrosian (1976) or Kron (1980) magnitudes, which are
suitable for extended sources. We note that the upper limits are given for different thresholds: 3σ (2MASS), 5σ (Pan-STARRS and VHS), S/N of 10 (DES), and 10σ (SkyMapper). The limits are for point sources except
for the DES limits, which are for apertures of 1 95. For reference, Metcalfe et al. (2013) ﬁnd that galaxies have a 50% completeness about 0.4magAB brighter than stars using Pan-STARRS observations. Filters of
different telescopes are also slightly different.

Appendix C
Fit Statistics

Table C1 provides statistic measures for all spectral ﬁts. We
note that the number of photons (essentially the degrees of

Alp & Larsson
freedom) is very limited in some cases, especially for the time-
resolved spectra. This introduces substantial variance in the
goodness measures.
