Abstract

During the ﬁrst few hundred days after the explosion, core-collapse supernovae (SNe) emit down-scattered X-rays
and gamma-rays originating from radioactive line emissions, primarily from the 56Ni→56Co→56Fe chain. We
use supernova (SN) models based on three-dimensional neutrino-driven explosion simulations of single stars and
mergers to compute this emission and compare the predictions with observations of SN1987A. A number of
models are clearly excluded, showing that high-energy emission is a powerful way of discriminating between
models. The best models are almost consistent with the observations, but differences that cannot be matched by a
suitable choice of viewing angle are evident. Therefore, our self-consistent models suggest that neutrino-driven
explosions are able to produce, in principle, sufﬁcient mixing, although remaining discrepancies may require small
changes to the progenitor structures. The soft X-ray cutoff is primarily determined by the metallicity of the
progenitor envelope. The main effect of asymmetries is to vary the ﬂux level by a factor of ∼3. For the more
the shapes of the light curves also change. In addition to the models of SN1987A,
asymmetric models,
we investigate two models of SNeII-P and one model of a stripped-envelope SNIIb. The TypeII-P models have
observables similar to those of the models of SN1987A, but the stripped-envelope SN model is signiﬁcantly more
luminous and evolves faster. Finally, we make simple predictions for future observations of nearby SNe.

1. Introduction

A core-collapse supernova (CCSN) is the death of a massive
star (Baade & Zwicky 1934; Hoyle & Fowler 1960), but the
exact nature of the explosion remains obscured. The so-called
delayed neutrino-heating mechanism (Arnett 1966; Colgate &
White 1966; Bethe & Wilson 1985; Bruenn 1985) is a leading
hypothesis in which a stalled shock is revived by neutrinos
emitted from the surface of a hot proto-neutron star (for
reviews, see Janka 2012, 2017; Burrows 2013; Janka et al.
2016; Müller 2016; Couch 2017). Recent three-dimensional
(3D) simulations are able to include the basic physics necessary
to describe the neutrino interaction and heating, and to
simulate the outcome of the Fe core collapse, which then
connects to the long-term simulations involving the whole star
(Wongwathanarat et al. 2013, 2015, M. Gabler et al. 2019, in
preparation). These simulations demonstrated that 3D effects
are important both for the neutrino heating and the hydro-
dynamic instabilities above the Fe core.

To verify the supernova (SN) theory and assumptions that go
into the simulations, it is important to compare the model
predictions with observations. The spatial density and abun-
dance distributions of the ejecta provide key information about
the progenitor and explosion mechanism of core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe). Another valuable property that
is
observable is the X-ray and gamma-ray emission up to
approximately 1000 days after the explosion(d). This emission
arises from the radioactive decays of the unstable isotopes

synthesized during the ﬁrst few seconds after core collapse
(Hoyle 1954; Burbidge et al. 1957; Fowler & Hoyle 1964; Hix
& Harris 2017). When an unstable isotope decays, gamma-rays
are emitted. These gamma-rays lose energy due to Compton
scattering as they propagate through the ejecta, and are then
either destroyed by photoelectric absorption or escape the
ejecta. An advantage of studying the early X-ray and gamma-
ray emission is that the emission can be computed directly from
the ejecta models without
specifying the
microscopic mixing since the thermal conditions are decoupled
from the high-energy radiation ﬁeld (Jerkstrand et al. 2011).
The emission is thus a sensitive probe of the macroscopic
mixing and the ejecta structure. Additionally,
the relevant
physics for the photon propagation is well known and the
gamma-ray transfer is computationally cheap compared to
(Hillier & Dessart 2012;
more general
Jerkstrand et al. 2016).

radiation transfer

the need of

Several groups have applied this method to compute the
X-ray and gamma-ray emission from CCSN models. Previous
studies of 3D models have explored bipolar SNII models
(Hungerford et al. 2003) and single-lobe TypeII explosion
models (Hungerford et al. 2005). Maeda (2006) investigated
jet-like broad-lined SN models, and Wollaeger et al. (2017)
computed both optical and high-energy spectra from a
unimodal 3D model. A large number of models were also
created and studied shortly after SN 1987A (for an overview,
see McCray 1993). This early modeling of SN1987A was

Alp et al.

based on much more simpliﬁed 1D simulations. There are also
several studies that have applied analogous methods to SNIa
(Burrows & The 1990; Höﬂich 2002; Sim 2007; Sim &
Mazzali 2008; Kromer & Sim 2009; Maeda et al. 2012; Summa
et al. 2013; The & Burrows 2014) and kilonova models
(Hotokezaka et al. 2016; Korobkin et al. 2019).

In addition to the (down-scattered) X-rays and gamma-rays
from the radioactive decay, other processes can also contribute to
the high-energy emission. Lines from electron transitions are
only relevant below 10keV in SNe, which is at lower energies
than the component from the radioactive decay. The photons
from the radioactive decay also produce fast recoil electrons
through Compton scattering. The bremsstrahlung emission from
these electrons is expected to be much fainter than the emission
from the radioactive decay in the relevant energy range (Clayton
& The 1991; Burrows & van Riper 1995). Interactions with the
circumstellar medium (CSM) is another potential source of
X-rays (Chevalier & Fransson 1994, 2017). This is a weak
component for the vast majority of all SNe (Dwarkadas 2014)
and is typically at lower X-ray energies, although the hard X-ray
regime is CSM-dominated in some cases. Examples of such
cases include the nearby, strongly interacting SN1993J (Leising
et al. 1994; Fransson et al. 1996) and the extremely luminous
TypeIIn SN2010jl (Chevalier & Irwin 2012; Ofek et al. 2014).
Such CSM interaction results in spectra and light curves that are
very different from those produced by reprocessed radioactive
decay. Additionally, the gamma-ray continuum, and in part-
icular, the direct line emission from the radioactive decay are
unlikely to be confused with other emission components, even
under extreme circumstances.

In this paper, we compute the early X-ray and gamma-ray
emission from recent full 3D SN models based on neutrino-
driven explosion simulations (Wongwathanarat et al. 2013,
2015) and compare the predicted emission properties to
observations of SN1987A. SN1987A was a CCSN in the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which makes it the closest
observed SN in more than four centuries (for reviews, see
Arnett et al. 1989; McCray 1993; McCray & Fransson 2016).
The proximity of SN1987A makes it the only CCSN where
detailed observations of
the early X-ray and gamma-ray
evolution have been possible. The comparisons allow us to
constrain properties of the ejecta structure and composition,
and investigate the viability of recent SN simulations and
SN1987A progenitor models. We also investigate models of
other types of SNe. This allows us to extend the results to more
common SN types and serves as predictions for
future
observations.

This paper is organized as follows. We describe the SN
models in Section 2 and the observations of SN1987A in
Section 3. The algorithm we use for the computations of the
early emission is outlined in Section 4, and we present the
results in Section 5. We discuss the results and important
details in Section 6 and provide a summary and the main
conclusions in Section 7.

2. Models

We use SN models based on 3D neutrino-driven explosion
simulations. An overview of the models is provided in Table 1.
All progenitor models are 1D but are mapped into three
dimensions with imposed low-amplitude random cell-by-cell
perturbations to seed hydrodynamic instabilities for the SN
explosion simulations (Wongwathanarat et al. 2013). Below,

2

we describe the properties of the models that are most relevant
to the current study. Comprehensive descriptions of all
simulations can be found in the original references (Table 1).
All simulations included the neutrino luminosity as a free
parameter, which effectively determines the ﬁnal explosion
energy (Eexp). We note that we do not use the light-bulb
approximation, meaning that the outgoing neutrino luminos-
ities are considerably modiﬁed by the infalling material in our
simulations. The neutrino luminosity was tuned to result in
explosion energies of ∼1.5×1051 erg for all models. This
roughly corresponds to estimates for SN1987A (Woosley et al.
1988; Bethe 1990; Bethe & Pizzochero 1990; Shigeyama &
Nomoto 1990; Blinnikov et al. 2000; Utrobin 2005), and is also
fairly representative for ordinary SNeII-P (Kasen & Woosley
2009; Pejcha & Prieto 2015; Müller et al. 2017) and IIb SNe
(Taddia et al. 2018).

For a given explosion energy, large variations are expected
for the density and abundance distributions of the ejecta, which
are determined by a coupled interaction between the explosion
dynamics and progenitor structure (Wongwathanarat et al.
2015; Utrobin et al. 2019). In other words, these differences
can be used to discriminate different progenitor models using
observational data.

The M15-7b and M16-7b models are the results of mergers,
whereas all the other models are single-star models. The B15,
N20, M15-7b, and M16-7b models end their lives as blue
supergiants (BSGs) and are designed to match the progenitor of
SN1987A. The B15 model is the single-star progenitor that
yields the best agreement with the optical
light curve of
SN1987A, based on self-consistent 3D explosion models
(Utrobin et al. 2015). For the merger models, Menon et al.
(2019) present results for artiﬁcially mixed 1D explosions,
while V. Utrobin et al. (2019, in preparation) present light-
curve analysis based on the 3D neutrino-driven explosion
models.

We have investigated all six merger models of Menon &
Heger (2017) that match the observational properties of the
SN1987A progenitor. We only present results from the M15-
7b and M16-7b models here. The M15-7b model ﬁts the X-ray
and gamma-ray observations best, and M16-7b is the worst
model. This choice means that
the X-ray and gamma-ray
properties of M15-7b and M16-7b roughly bracket those of the
complete set of merger models.

The L15 and W15 models are red supergiants (RSGs), which
allow us to extend the results to SNeII-P, which is the most
frequent
is an
explosion of a nearly bare He core with a thin H envelope,
which shows similarity to CasA (Wongwathanarat et al. 2017).
All progenitors except the N20 and IIb models were created
using self-consistent stellar evolution simulations. The N20
model (Shigeyama & Nomoto 1990) was created by combining
the core (Nomoto & Hashimoto 1988) and envelope (Saio et al.
1988) of two different models. This was done in an attempt to
match the properties of the progenitor of SN1987A. The IIb
model was created by artiﬁcially removing all but 0.3 ☉M of
the H envelope of Model W15-2-cw. This model is aimed to
mimic a typical progenitor star of a SNIIb.

The mixing of 56Ni is important for the early X-ray and
gamma-ray emission.
In Table 1, we provide the mass-
weighted average radial velocity of the fastest 1% of 56Ni.
This is similar to Wongwathanarat et al. (2015). Here, however,
we weight the tracer element representing the uncertainty in the

a The ﬁrst letter does not correspond to any physical quantity but is related to the creators. The two-digit number is approximately the zero-age main-sequence
(ZAMS) mass in solar masses. The single-digit number indicates the model number in the series of models varying the explosion energy and initial seed perturbation
(Wongwathanarat et al. 2013). The last two letters are “pw” for power-law wind or “cw” for constant-wind boundary. For the binary merger progenitors, the ﬁrst two-
digit numbers give the ZAMS masses of the primary stars in solar masses, the following one-digit numbers refer to the ZAMS masses of the secondary stars in solar
masses, and the last letter before the ﬁrst hyphen is related to the fraction of the He-shell mass dredged up.

nucleosynthesis (referred to as X, Section 2.2) by 0.5 relative to
56Ni, instead of 1.0, to remain consistent with the rest of this
paper. The radial velocity of the fastest 56Ni is a simpliﬁed
representation of the amount of mixing in the models. The
enclosed mass coordinate of the fastest 56Ni should be related
to the total ejecta mass (Mej) because of the importance of the
amount of material outside of the fastest 56Ni (Section 6.1).

The large range of fastest 56Ni velocities indicates that the set
of explosion models span a large range of mixing properties.
The reason for this has been explored for the B15, N20, L15,
and W15 models (Wongwathanarat et al. 2015; Utrobin et al.
2019). The mixing in these models is the result of a complex
interplay between the progenitor structure, dynamics of the
SN shock, and propagation of the neutrino-heated ejecta.
One factor that favors efﬁcient mixing is the fast growth of
the (C+O)/He interface.
Rayleigh–Taylor
Furthermore, a weak interaction of
fast Rayleigh–Taylor
plumes with the strong reverse shock occurring below the
He/H composition interface also enhances the amount of
mixing. So far, however, studies have relied solely on a small
number of single-star progenitor models. Detailed analysis of
the merger models and comparisons with single-star models
will be presented in a future paper (V. Utrobin et al. 2019, in
preparation).

instabilities at

Finally, we also include some comparisons with the 10HMM
model (Pinto & Woosley 1988) as a reference. It was fairly
successful at describing several observables of SN1987A and
is representative of the extensive, but much more simpliﬁed,
early work on the progenitor of SN1987A (see Section 2.2 of
McCray 1993). The 10HMM model is 1D, and importantly, has
additional mixing introduced by hand.

2.1. Geometry

Of particular relevance to the gamma-ray transfer are the
spatial resolutions of the simulations and the asymmetries
caused by the hydrodynamic instabilities. The late-time
simulations were run on axis-free Yin-Yang grids (Kageyama

& Sato 2004; Wongwathanarat et al. 2010) with a relative
radial resolution better than 1% at all radii and an angular
resolution of 2°. For this study, the models are mapped from
the Yin-Yang grids to spherical grids. The resolution of the
spherical grids is sufﬁcient to perform the mapping without
signiﬁcant
loss of characteristic structures. The simulations
provide no information on the small-scale mixing below the
grid scale, but this does not affect the properties of the ejecta
that are relevant for the gamma-ray propagation.

The H-rich single-star models are evolved until ∼150days
and the IIb model until 18days, beyond which they can be
assumed to expand homologously (M. Gabler et al. 2019, in
preparation). The merger models are only available at an age of
1day, from which we scale the models homologously. We
check the effects of the late-time radioactive heating on the
dynamics by comparing results from a version of the B15
model that has been expanded homologously from 1day to the
standard B15 model that has been followed by simulations until
156days. The primary difference introduced by the late-time
heating is increased mixing, leading to a ﬂux increase of ∼20%
for most cases, although it can reach ∼40% for the direct line
emission at early times (<200 days). Homologous expansion is
a reasonable approximation for a few thousand years (e.g.,
Truelove & McKee 1999), but this period of the evolution
could be more than an order of magnitude shorter in extreme
cases, such as SNeIIn and in the presence of the equatorial ring
in the case of SN1987A.
the ejecta expand
homologously inside of the reverse shock resulting from the
interaction of the outermost ejecta with the CSM. During
the ﬁrst 1000days of SN1987A, before interaction with the
equatorial ring, all of the ejecta can safely be assumed to
expand homologously. In fact, the central parts of the ejecta
that contain the majority of the mass are still freely expanding
at current epochs (Fransson et al. 2013).

In general,

The explosion in all models sets in strongly asymmetrically
as a consequence of hydrodynamic instabilities associated with
the deposition of neutrino energy behind the stalled shock. This

These initial explosion asymmetries trigger the growth of
secondary non-radial hydrodynamic instabilities after the shock
crosses the composition–shell interfaces on its way out from
the center to the surface of the exploding star. A more detailed
description of the ejecta asymmetries can be found in Section 5
of Wongwathanarat et al. (2015) and Section 3.3 of Utrobin
et al. (2019).

2.2. Radioactive Elements

The nucleosynthesis is treated slightly differently in the
different models. The nucleosynthesis in the SN1987A models
was followed by a network of elements that includes 1H; the 13
α-nuclei from 4He to 56Ni; and a tracer nucleus X (Kifonidis
et al. 2003; Wongwathanarat et al. 2013, 2015). The tracer
represents elements that were produced in grid cells where the
electron fraction was below 0.49. Therefore, X comprises
neutron-rich, Fe-group elements, but the simulations provide
no additional information about the compositions. The net-
works used for the RSG and IIb models omit 32S, 36Ar, 48Cr,
and 52Fe.

The most

important nuclear decay data are provided in
Table 2. We follow the decays 56Ni→56Co→56Fe (Clayton
et al. 1969) and 57Co→57Fe (Clayton 1974). The most
important transition during the relevant time intervals in the
current context is 56Co→56Fe. The transition 57Co→57Fe
dominates below 100keV at epochs later than ∼800days for
the H-rich models and ∼300days for the stripped IIb model.
The contribution from the 44Ti→44Sc→44Ca chain is
negligible during the time periods considered in this paper.
Finally, the isotope 57Ni has a half-life of 36hr and is much
less abundant than 56Ni. The contribution of 57Ni→57Co is,
therefore, always negligible.

The true composition of X and the limited nuclear networks
introduce uncertainties in the masses of individual isotopes. We
compute the opacities based on the masses
from the
simulations, but rescale the escaping ﬂuxes as if the masses
of the radioactive sources match observations of SN1987A for
all models. All 56Ni masses from the simulations are consistent,
within the large uncertainties, with the ∼0.07 ☉M of 56Ni
produced by SN1987A (Suntzeff & Bouchet 1990; Bouchet
et al. 1991). The spatial distribution of 56Ni is taken to be the
distribution of the sum of the 56Ni explicitly followed by the
grid weighted by 1 and the tracer X weighted by 0.5. We
investigate the effect of this choice by comparing results based

on weighing the tracer by 0 and 1. The ﬂux level varies by less
than 25% in most cases, the shapes of the spectra are practically
unchanged, and light-curve peaks shift by less than ∼50days.
We set the mass of 57Ni by adopting a ﬁxed ratio of the mass
of 57Ni relative to that of 56Ni. The estimates of the 57Ni/56Ni
ratio of SN1987A from explosive nucleosynthesis networks
(Thielemann et al. 1990; Woosley & Hoffman 1991), direct
observations (Syunyaev et al. 1990; Kurfess et al. 1992), and
light-curve modeling (Fransson & Kozma 1993) favor values
around twice the solar ratio, where the solar system 57Fe/56Fe
number ratio is 0.023 (Lodders 2003). The spatial distribution
of 57Ni is represented by the tracer X.

For consistency and for facilitating comparisons, we scale
the ﬂuxes of all models to match the radioactive isotope yields
of SN1987A. This puts the 56Ni masses of our RSG
explosions around the 80th percentile of the distribution of
inferred yields of ordinary SNeII-P (Kasen & Woosley 2009;
Pejcha & Prieto 2015; Müller et al. 2017; Anderson 2019). In
contrast, the 56Ni mass of our IIb model is at the 20th percentile
of the inferred 56Ni masses of SNeIIb (Taddia et al. 2018;
Anderson 2019), which peaks at roughly twice the 56Ni mass of
SN1987A.

2.3. Progenitor Metallicity

The progenitor metallicity is important because it determines
the composition of the outermost parts of the models that are
not mixed with the freshly synthesized material. The envelope
metallicity signiﬁcantly affects the emerging emission because
the metals (primarily Fe) dominate the photoabsorption opacity
in the relevant 10–100keV range, even at metallicities that are
much lower than the solar metallicity.

Instead of using the standard deﬁnition of metallicity, we deﬁne
the effective metallicity (Zeff) as the photoabsorption opacity at
30keV. This is done because the abundance patterns of the
different models are different and the photoabsorption opacity is
the most important consequence of the metallicity in the current
context. The effective metallicities of all models are provided in
Table 1. It is worth pointing out that the effective metallicity of the
LMC is 0.54
. Relative to solar metallicity, this is slightly
higher than what is typically adopted as the (standard) metallicity
of the LMC. This is a result of Fe dominating the photoabsorption
opacity above 6.4keV and that Fe is not as under-abundant as
many of the intermediate-mass elements.

require this modiﬁcation. For example, the effective metallicity
of the B15 model before correction is 0.03

that the RSGs, mergers, and IIb models are unmodiﬁed from
their evolutionary compositions and have slightly lower
effective metallicities (Table 1).

3. Observations of SN1987A

We use early X-ray and gamma-ray observations of
SN1987A as an observational
the simulated SN
models. The comparisons can be divided into three categories;
spectra, continuum light curves, and line ﬂuxes. The observa-
tions of the line proﬁles are investigated in a separate paper
(A. Jerkstrand et al. 2019, in preparation).

Alp et al.
The distance to SN1987A is taken to be 51.2kpc (Panagia
et al. 1991; Gould & Uza 1998; Panagia 1999; Mitchell et al.
2002) and when comparing simulations to observations, we
correct the observed spectra for the recessional heliocentric
velocity of the LMC of 287kms−1 (Gröningsson et al. 2008a,
2008b). The ISM absorption is negligible in the relevant energy
range of ∼10–3500keV (e.g., Willingale et al. 2013; Frank
et al. 2016).

An overview of all early hard X-ray and gamma-ray
observations of SN1987A is provided in Table 4. Some of
the early X-ray and gamma-ray observations have also been
summarized by other authors (Bunner 1988; Gehrels et al. 1988;
Leising 1991; Teegarden 1991; Tueller 1991; Wamsteker 1993).
Below, we brieﬂy describe the instruments and data used for our
comparisons.

3.1. The Roentgen Observatory

The Roentgen Observatory was an experiment in the Kvant
module of the space station Mir. The Kvant module carrying
Roentgen docked to Mir during 1987 April and started
observing SN1987A 168days after the outburst and continued
to monitor SN1987A to later than 800days. We use data from
the HEXE and the PulsarX-18 instruments.

HEXE was the most sensitive instrument and provides
relatively accurate continuum light curves in three energy
bands in 15–200keV (Syunyaev et al. 1990). Low-resolution
spectra were also extracted for seven epochs. We also use
spectra from PulsarX-1 at 320days (Syunyaev et al. 1988).
The data are of signiﬁcantly lower quality and are primarily
included with the purpose of verifying the HEXE spectra above
70keV during peak brightness, while also extending the
energy coverage to 600keV.

3.2. SMM

The SMM was launched in 1980 and was a dedicated solar
observatory. One of the seven instruments on board was the
GRS, which operates in the energy range 0.3–8.5MeV (Forrest
et al. 1980). The moderate energy resolution of around 50keV at
1MeV is insufﬁcient for resolving the radioactive line proﬁles.
SMM was unable to point away from the Sun except for
short durations, so SN1987A was observed as a part of the
background emission while SMM performed solar observations.
Because SMM was operational for 7 yr before SN1987A, it was
possible to monitor the background gamma-ray ﬂux before the
explosion and then detect SN1987A as a change in the
background level during its early evolution.

We use data from SMM to constrain the evolution of the line
ﬂuxes. SMM provides the most accurate measurements of the
line ﬂuxes and also continuously monitored SN1987A
throughout its early evolution. No emission from SN1987A
was detected before 1987 July, but the 56Co decay lines rose
rapidly during 150–200days (Matz et al. 1988). The line
emission peaked shortly thereafter, and then decayed beyond
the detection threshold around day 600 (Leising & Share
1990).

0°. 6 from SN1987A.

3.3. Ginga

The X-ray astronomy satellite Ginga (“Galaxy”) was launched
on 1987 February 5 and started observing SN1987A
2 days after outburst and monitored SN1987A for more than
1000 days. The ﬁrst detection of emission from SN1987A was
on day 131 (Dotani et al. 1987). Ginga carried three instruments,
but only data from the LAC are used for this work. The LAC
was a collimator and provided data on SN1987A in the
6–28keV range. Because of the relatively large collimator
opening angle, the data might be contaminated by background
sources (Inoue et al. 1991). For this reason, we choose to
exclude data during an apparent ﬂaring period in 1988 January.
We use the Ginga light curves in the 6–16 and 16–28keV
ranges. For the presentations in this paper, we treat the two
bands as spectral bins for the comparisons at speciﬁc times.
The X-ray emission in the full 6–28keV range consists of two
emission components (Tanaka 1988) and the energy cut at
16keV was chosen to optimally separate them from each other
(Inoue et al. 1991). The signal-to-noise ratio in the low-energy
band is low and the emission could be the result of interactions
with the CSM or bremsstrahlung from the fast recoil electrons.
This means that the low-energy band is not strictly comparable
to our predictions but could be viewed as an upper limit. The
16–28keV component
likely
represents the low-energy cutoff of the Comptonized radio-
active emission (Inoue et al. 1991; Tanaka 1991). The Ginga
data agree reasonably well with the Roentgen/HEXE data in
the overlapping energy range.

is less variable and most

3.4. Balloon-borne Experiments

We use data from a number of balloon-borne experiments,
the details of which are summarized in Table 4. They provide
independent measurements of the spectra (MSFC, GRIP),
which agree well with the data from HEXE and PulsarX-1.
This effectively also veriﬁes the continuum ﬂux measurements

6

of HEXE that are used to construct the continuum light curves.
All of the balloon experiments that we include were able to
measure line ﬂuxes, which show reasonable agreement with the
line ﬂux evolution as observed by SMM (Figure 5 of Leising &
Share 1990). Additionally, only balloon-borne experiments
(GRIS, JPL, GRAD) carried instruments with sufﬁcient energy
resolution to resolve the line proﬁles of 56Co (presented in
A. Jerkstrand et al. 2019, in preparation).

4. Algorithm and Implementation

We compute the X-ray and gamma-ray properties by
following the propagation of Monte Carlo (MC) photons
through the ejecta. The interactions we include are photo-
electric absorption, Compton scattering, and pair production.
We do not compute bremsstrahlung or ﬂuorescent emission
because these effects only contribute signiﬁcantly at energies
below the sharp photoabsorption cutoff around 15keV
(Woosley et al. 1989; Clayton & The 1991; Burrows & van
Riper 1995). We verify our code by comparing it to previously
published spectra and light curves (Milne et al. 2004; The &
Burrows 2014) of the W7 model (Nomoto et al. 1984), and by
comparing the results from our code to those from HEIMDALL
(Maeda et al. 2014) and SUMO-3D (A. Jerkstrand et al. 2019,
in preparation).

We use ξi to denote random numbers uniformly distributed
in the range of 0–1, where the index i distinguishes the different
random numbers. Spatial vectors are denoted using boldface
(e.g., a), and the Cartesian components are (ax, ay, az). The
spherical components are (
, where f is the azimuthal
angle ranging from 0–2 π, and the polar angle θ is deﬁned from
0 at the north pole to π at the south pole. Four vectors are
denoted using Greek indices (e.g., bμ). We denote quantities in
the SN frame without primes and quantities in frames locally
comoving with the homologous expansion with primes.

4.1. Cross Sections

In this section, we describe the cross sections used for
Compton scattering, photoabsorption, and pair production. The
absorption and scattering properties of the tracer X are set to
those of 56Fe.

We take the pair production cross sections from Ambwani &
Sutherland (1988), which interpolate tabulated values of the
cross sections (Hubbell 1969; Hubbell et al. 1980). The pair
production cross sections are

The Compton scattering cross section is given by the Klein–
Nishina formula (e.g., Rybicki & Lightman 1979). For
computational stability and performance, we use an approx-
imate expression for the Klein–Nishina cross section (p. 319 of
Pozdnyakov et al. 1983). The difference between the approx-
imation and the exact formula is less than 1% at all energies.

where Ef is the ﬁnal photon energy, Ei the initial photon energy,
me the electron mass, and α the scattering angle. It shows the
important property that
the fractional energy loss is much
higher when the energy before scattering is comparable to, or
higher than, the electron rest energy.

4.1.2. Photoelectric Absorption

Photoabsorption cross sections are quickly declining func-
tions of energy E, which implies that photoabsorption is only
relevant at relatively low X-ray energies. It starts becoming
important around 100keV and dominates below ∼40keV for
typical SN abundances (Alp et al. 2018). The non-relativistic
high-energy asymptote is approximately proportional to E−3.
We use the cross sections of Verner et al. (1996).

We note that the cross sections of Verner et al. (1996) are
very similar to those of Verner & Yakovlev (1995) at energies
above 10keV for the relevant isotopes, except for 4He. The
photoabsorption cross section of 4He from Verner et al. (1996)
is approximately 40% lower than the value of Verner &
Yakovlev (1995) but the effect on the escaping ﬂuxes is only
approximately 1%. The cross sections of Verner et al. (1996)
are also very similar to those of Veigele (1973).9

4.1.3. Pair Production

We include pair production primarily for comparisons with
other codes (Milne et al. 2004). We have indeed veriﬁed that
this effect has a negligible impact on the results for the models
studied in this paper. For example, for 56Ni, the scattering cross
section is 10 times higher than the pair production cross section
at 3MeV, and they are approximately equal at 10MeV (see
Figure 1 of Milne et al. 2004). Typically, less than 0.1% of the
total photons are pair absorbed.

4.2. Photon Initialization

Gamma-ray photons are created by the decay of

the
radioactive isotopes in the inner regions of the ejecta. Each
MC photon is initially created by assigning a spatial position r,
a direction of propagation W, and a photon energy. The initial
spatial distribution is given by the spatial distribution of the
parent nuclei in the models (Section 2.2). The direction of the
photons are random in the rest frame of the homologously
expanding parent nuclei, and the initial photon energies are the
well-deﬁned energies of the corresponding transitions. Impor-
tant data about the radioactive lines included in the code are
provided in Table 2. With the energy E′ and the direction W¢, it
the four-momentum ¢mp and
is straightforward to construct
to the SN frame. The result of
inverse Lorentz boost
accounting for the difference in reference frames is that the
energies E are Doppler shifted and W slightly beamed in
the outward direction. The effect on the result introduced by the
beaming is an increase in escaping number ﬂux of
less
than 1%.

as the line starting from the position of the previous scattering,
or the initial position if the photon has just been created. This
integral is solved continuously as the photon travels through

9 In passing, we also note that the photoelectric cross sections of H and He
have been switched in Table 3 of Hoeﬂich et al. (1992).

1.0063 as printed in Equation (2) of Ambwani & Sutherland (1988).

the ejecta by discretizing the continuous integral into a sum of
ﬁnite dL. The discretization is chosen such that the distance dL
is equal to 1% of the magnitude of the current radial position of
the photon. It was veriﬁed that ﬁner discretizations result in
similar results and the spatial resolution is ultimately limited by
the resolution of the models (see Section 2.1). A photon
propagates until τ reaches a limiting optical depth τlim, which is
sampled from the distribution

At this point, one of the following three interactions occurs: the
photon scatters off an electron, the photon is photoabsorbed,
and the photon pair produces.

4.4. Interactions

In this subsection, we describe how the different interactions
are treated numerically at the point of interaction. Scattering
affects the photon energy and the direction of propagation, but
does not destroy the photon; photoabsorption destroys the photon;
and pair production destroys the photon and creates an electron–
positron pair. We assume that no positronium forms and that each
positron is converted into a photon pair locally (Chugai et al.
1997; Ruiz-Lapuente & Spruit 1998; Jerkstrand et al. 2011).

An interaction occurs when τ=τlim.

is fulﬁlled, the photon is absorbed. Absorption means that the

is fulﬁlled, the original photon is replaced by a pair of 511keV
photons with random directions in the locally comoving frame.
This represents pair production and subsequent annihilation.

If neither condition is fulﬁlled, scattering occurs and a new
direction and energy are computed. Both the new photon
direction and energy are dependent on the velocity of the
scattering electron. The electron velocities are taken to be the
velocities given by the homologous expansion, implying that
all electrons are moving radially outward. The effect of this
compared to stationary electrons is an increase in escaping
number ﬂux of approximately 2%. We also veriﬁed that the
thermal motion of electrons is unimportant compared to the
bulk ejecta expansion in the situation under consideration,
where temperatures are lower than 10,000K.

The next step is to sample a new direction and energy for the
photons after scattering. The distribution of the scattering angle
frame is given by (e.g., Rybicki &
in the electron rest

where Ω is the solid angle. We note that this expression depends
on the energy after scattering, which is given by Equation (1). The
problem is to sample α from the distribution obtained by inserting
Equation (1) into Equation (10). One possibility is to compute the

8

Alp et al.

cumulative distribution function of α numerically and then use the
method of inverse functions (e.g., Section 9.1 of Pozdnyakov
et al. 1983) to draw samples of α from Equation (10) using
uniformly distributed random numbers. This requires a two-
dimensional lookup table of the cumulative distribution function
as a function of Ei and α. An alternative approach based on a
rejection technique is presented in Section9.5 of Pozdnyakov
et al. (1983), which is also summarized in AppendixD of Santana
et al. (2016).11 We veriﬁed that both methods agree, and choose to
implement the rejection algorithm.

4.5. Output

The output of our simulation is a list of photons that escape
the SN. For each photon packet, we save the initial and ﬁnal
energy; the direction of propagation; the number of scatterings;
the time of the packet as measured by an observer at inﬁnity;
and initial SN age when the packet was created by a radioactive
decay. The initial time is used to weight the packet by the
remaining mass of the radioactive parent nuclei at that time.
This weight is equivalent to the number of photons represented
by the packet. We note that we include the expansion of the
ejecta while the photon is traveling. The effect of including
“live” expansion of the ejecta is a decrease in escaping ﬂux of
approximately 1%, because while the photon is traveling
outward, the ejecta also expand. The packet lists contain all
information necessary to construct light curves and spectra
during selected time intervals. It is also possible to investigate
the light curves and spectra along different lines of sight.

5. Results

First, in Section 5.1, we present the effects of the ejecta
asymmetries on the escaping X-ray and gamma-ray emission
integrated over all energies, which are important for interpret-
ing the comparisons with the observed data of SN1987A.
Then, we compare the models that attempt to match SN1987A
(B15, N20, M15-7b, M16-7b, and 10HMM) with the
observational data. Predictions from the B15 and M15-7b
models show the best agreement with the observations.
Therefore, we focus on these two models and provide more
details on their asymmetries. The spectra are presented in
Section 5.2, the continuum light curves in Section 5.3, and the
line ﬂuxes in Section 5.4. Lastly, we include spectra and line
ﬂuxes for the models that represent other types of SNe in
Section 5.5 and investigate the effects of progenitor metallicity
in Section 5.6. The line proﬁles are investigated in a separate
paper (A. Jerkstrand et al. 2019, in preparation).

Error bars for the observational data correspond to 1σ
conﬁdence intervals. Exceptions are temporal error bars that
represent the integration periods and spectral bins where the
error bars represent the bin widths.

5.1. Asymmetries

Figure 1 shows spherical projections of the escape directions
of the photons for the different models. All models primarily
show variations on large angular scales, and the brightness is
correlated with the center of mass of the 56Ni. Generally, the
anisotropies are larger at early times. The temporal evolutions

different times and the right column shows the N20, M15-7b, and W15 models at 300days. The points show the direction of the 56Ni center of mass (blue), minimum

integrated distributions. The ﬂux asymmetries are initially larger and slowly decrease as the ejecta dilute. The main difference is the difference in amplitude of the ﬂux
asymmetries, which reﬂects the different levels of ejecta asymmetries in the models.

the angle-averaged
quantities are useful, although no real observer is able to
measure them. The angle-averaged properties also do not
require arbitrary choices of viewing angles and are less
sensitive to MC noise. Because of the directional variations
are negligible on small angular scales, we use half-opening
angles of 30° when computing quantities along certain
directions. The extremum directions are deﬁned by the
extremum number ﬂuxes integrated over all energies and all
times (<1000 days).

5.2. Spectra

The left panel of Figure 2 shows the averaged and directional
spectra for the B15 and M15-7b models at 300days and the
corresponding observational data. At 300days, both the shapes

and the amplitudes are in reasonable agreement with the data,
and any remaining deviations between models and observa-
tions can relatively easily be accommodated by the variance
introduced by the asymmetries. An important property is that
the asymmetries change the overall normalizations, but does
not affect the shapes much. The typical amplitude of the ﬂux
variations for different viewing angles spans a factor of ∼2, but
the most asymmetric model, M15-7b, shows variations up to a
factor of ∼5.

The right panel of Figure 2 compares all spectra of the
SN1987A models with observational data around 300days.
We use the direction-averaged spectra and simply note that
variations of a factor of a few in amplitude are possible because
of asymmetries, in particular at early times (Section 6.1.1). The
N20 model matches the observed spectra well but is only doing

so around 300days (Section 5.3). The 1D model 10HMM also
agrees relatively well with the observations, but this required
mixing introduced by hand (Section 2). This shows that 3D
models are able to self-consistently produce mixing at levels
similar to what is inferred from observations, whereas this had
to be introduced artiﬁcially in 1D models.

The M16-7b model (red line toward the bottom of Figure 2
right) clearly fails to match the observations. We reiterate
(Section 2) that M15-7b and M16-7b are presented here
because they ﬁt the X-ray and gamma-ray observations best
and worst, respectively, out of the six merger progenitors that
fulﬁll the observational criteria of the SN 1987A progenitor
(Menon & Heger 2017). Out of the remaining four merger
models (not shown), M15-8b and M17-7a are very similar to
M16-7b, whereas M16-4a and M17-8b are intermediate cases.
Only M15-7b agrees reasonably well with the X-ray and
gamma-ray observations, whereas the remaining ﬁve merger
models can be ruled out.

5.3. Continuum Light Curves

The light curves in different energy bands show similar
results, but we focus on the 45–105keV observations by
HEXE because they are the most accurate. The left panel of
Figure 3 shows the averaged and directional light curves for
the B15 and M15-7b models in the 45–105keV range and the
corresponding HEXE data. The asymmetries clearly affect
the ﬂux magnitude and the time of the initial rise. In contrast,
the declining tails are relatively similar along different
directions. This is a manifestation of the emission asymmetries
becoming less pronounced at later times.

The average 45–105keV light curves for all models and the
HEXE observations are shown in the right panel of Figure 3.
None of the models is able to match the early observed
breakout time and all overshoot the light curve at later times
(except for M16-7b, which completely fails to match the
observations). The general agreement with observations,

however, can still be considered acceptable given the
uncertainties and sensitivity of the emission properties on the
progenitor structure (Section 6.2).

the
observations that only covered one of the lines, we scale that
value by the atomic line yields to obtain the expected combined
ﬂux under the assumption of equal optical depths at 847 and
1238keV. There is possibly a slight indication that the SMM
measures lower ﬂuxes than the balloon-borne experiments
(Leising 1991; Teegarden 1994). For the comparisons with
model predictions, we primarily focus on the SMM values
because of
the continuous coverage and homogeneity of
the data.

The predicted line ﬂuxes show the same breakout

time
problem as the continuum light curves. The line ﬂux is more
sensitive to the viewing angle than the continuum emission in
the sense that the relative differences in ﬂux are larger. This is
because the continuum photons have scattered into new
directions before escaping the ejecta, which effectively reduces
the strength of the asymmetries. Apart from this, the viewing
angle also affects
the more
asymmetric models, similarly as for
the continuum light
curves. The accuracy of the observed line data is not as good
as the continuum precision. However, the line ﬂuxes are only
functions of the optical depth along the photon path, which
makes them valuable for breaking degeneracies when inter-
preting the more complex continuum data (Section 6.2).

model at 300days and is included for reference. The times are chosen to be
around peak ﬂux. The variations along different directions primarily affect the
magnitude of the ﬂux while the shape remains relatively constant (Figure 2).
The differences at the low-energy cutoff are primarily attributed to the different

of the RSG models L15 and W15, as well as the stripped IIb
model. We note that the H-rich models are shown at 300days,
whereas the IIb model is at 100days. This roughly corresponds
to the times of peak ﬂux. The spectral shape for a given model
is softer at earlier times and harder at later times. We note that
the RSG models are similar to the B15 model.

Figure 6 shows the 847keV line ﬂuxes of the L15, W15, and
IIb models. We also include the light curves along the
extremum directions. The variations due to asymmetries are
ﬂux variations by a factor of a few, but
the qualitative
properties of the line ﬂuxes are independent of the viewing
angle.

The most notable features of the IIb model are that it evolves
faster and is more luminous at the time of peak ﬂux than the
H-rich models. This is because of the lower ejecta mass and
higher expansion velocities. Furthermore,

The reason why the version with the SN1987A ring

shift of 2.1 ☉M of H into He (Section 6.1.3). This reduces the
electron density and signiﬁcantly decreases the scattering
opacity. However, the cutoff is still at an energy similar to
that of the version with 0.27

6. Discussion

6.1. General Model Emission Properties

Before comparing the predictions with the SN1987A
observations (Section 6.2), we discuss some general properties
of the predicted emission. The X-ray and gamma-ray emission
from different progenitors shows different properties. For a
given viewing angle,
important parameter is the
electron column density outside of the fastest 56Ni, or in other
words, the amount of mixing (Section 2). This determines the
time at which the ﬁrst emission starts escaping the ejecta. An
additional major difference between the models is that the
stripped IIb model evolves on shorter timescales and is more
luminous than the H-rich models because of its lower ejecta
mass and higher explosion velocities.

6.1.1. Variance due to Asymmetries

First, we explore the effects of the choice of viewing angle on
the observed properties. This is the variance introduced by the
3D structures for a given explosion. The variance arising from
the stochastic hydrodynamic instabilities for repeated explosions
of the same progenitor is investigated in Section 6.1.2.

We show the light curves in the 45–105keV range for the

the most
asymmetric model. The shapes of the spectra, however, are
only weakly affected (Figure 2). The general behavior of the
spectral shapes along different directions is larger differences at
higher energies, particularly for the direct line emission, than at
lower energies. This is because the scattering effectively
smooths out the asymmetries. This also implies that the line
ﬂuxes are more strongly affected by asymmetries than the
45–105keV light curves. The peak line ﬂux varies along
different directions by more than a factor of 5 in B15 and 10 in
M15-7b, and the times of peak line ﬂux differ by up to

for

100days in B15 and 300days in M15-7b between the
minimum and maximum directions.

The variance introduced by the stochastic hydrodynamic
evolution is seeded by the random ﬂuctuations in the structures
(Wongwathanarat et al. 2013). We

investigate the effects on the emission properties by simulating
three additional explosions of the M15-7b model. The ﬁrst
explosion differs by having different seed perturbations in the
mapping from the 1D progenitor into three dimensions. The
ﬁnal explosion energy of this second model is 1.44×1051 erg.
The two other explosions were simulated with different seed
perturbations and slightly different neutrino luminosities. They
result in explosion energies of 1.40×1051 and 1.76×1051
erg. A similar exercise was carried out using optical light
curves for three versions of the B15 model by Utrobin et al.
(2015).

The 45–105keV light curves for the four versions of M15-
7b are shown in Figure 9 (left). In addition to the variance due
to asymmetries of the individual models,
the peak ﬂux of
the 45–105keV continuum varies within ∼30% and the peak
time shifts by up to ∼100days. This means that the light-curve
shapes are slightly different. The line ﬂuxes (Figure 9, right)
show similar variance as the continua, with the primary
difference being that the angle-averaged line ﬂux peaks span a
factor of 2. For M15-7b, the differences in spectral shape
resulting from the stochastic nature of the explosion are much
smaller than the variance due to the intrinsic asymmetries.
Finally, B15 and M15-7b can still be distinguished, despite the
broad distributions of properties due to both the stochasticity of
the explosions and intrinsic asymmetries (Figures 8 and 9).

over all directions, the semitransparent dashed lines are along the directions of minimum ﬂux, and the semitransparent dashed–dotted lines are along the directions of
maximum ﬂux.

6.1.3. Progenitor Metallicity

The progenitor surface metallicity also has interesting
implications for the X-ray properties. Increasing progenitor
metallicity shifts the low-energy X-ray cutoff to higher energies
(Figure 7). This effect could potentially be used to constrain the
progenitor metallicity and has previously been discussed in the
context of SNeIa (Maeda et al. 2012). The cutoff is also not
very sensitive to the viewing angle (Figure 2) because it is
determined by the properties of the outermost layers of the
ejecta, which are more isotropic. On the other hand, if the
homogeneity of the outer envelope is broken by large-scale
convection (e.g., Hoﬂich 1991), it is likely that the low-energy
cutoff would be less sharp, which would make it more difﬁcult
to constrain the metallicity. Inversely, this could also serve as a
diagnostic of the envelope isotropy.

It is important to point out that the cutoff is only dependent
on the envelope metallicity when the low-energy limit is set by
photoabsorption. This is the case in the early phases during the
X-ray rise. At times later than the X-ray ﬂux peak, the escaping
emission is dominated by radiation from the deeper parts where
the mean atomic number is higher and photoelectric cross
sections are larger. Another contributing factor (especially at
very late times) is that the low-energy cutoff is determined by
the ability of the ejecta to trap photons, which determines how
many times photons scatter and lose energy before they escape.
In Section 2.3, we describe the metallicity corrections for the
B15 and N20 models to LMC abundances (Table 3). An
alternative is to use the abundances of the SN1987A progenitor
inferred from observations of the equatorial ring. We check the
effects on the results by comparing the B15 model with LMC
abundances (that is used throughout the rest of the paper) to a
B15 version with SN1987A abundances. The 45–105keV light
curves of these models are shown in Figure 10. The line ﬂuxes
behave in a similar way. The differences are primarily driven by
the increase of the of He abundance to 11.31 (0.21 relative to H
by number; Lundqvist & Fransson 1996; Mattila et al. 2010) and
the decrease of the Fe abundance to 6.98 (9.6×10−6 relative to
H by number, Dewey et al. 2008, 2012; Zhekov et al. 2009;
Mattila et al. 2010). Both changes contribute to lowering the

effective metallicity to 0.28
, and consequently, shift the
photoabsorption cutoff to lower energies (Figure 7).12 The
inferred SN1987A progenitor He abundance is more than
twice as high as the LMC abundance (Table 3). This requires a
conversion of 2.1 ☉M of H into He in the envelope, which is a
much more drastic change to the progenitor than the correction
to LMC abundances. The H-to-He change lowers the scattering
opacity because of the lower number of electrons per unit mass,
which in turn leads to an earlier time of rise and a higher peak

12 The conversion of H to He does not directly lower the effective metallicity
(in fact, the effective metallicity increases slightly). However, this indirectly
lowers the abundances of the metals, which dominate the photoabsorption
opacity, because we adopt values of all elements relative to H. Thus, the net
effect is a decrease of the effective metallicity.

features of

The predictions of the B15 and M15-7b models (along the
maximum direction) capture the general
the
observed data relatively well. There are, however, some
signiﬁcant differences that have constraining implications for
the models. The other SN1987A models are worse at
reproducing the observations, primarily because of insufﬁcient
mixing of the 56Ni to the outer layers (Table 1). The amount of
mixing depends on the properties of the progenitor in a
complex way and cannot be directly inferred from basic
progenitor or explosion parameters (Section 2). Understanding
this complex relation requires a more detailed analysis and
evaluation of the growth rates of Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities
for each of the models. This has been investigated for the
H-rich single-star progenitors (Wongwathanarat et al. 2015;
Utrobin et al. 2019), and both single stars and mergers will be
presented in a forthcoming paper (V. Utrobin et al. 2019, in
preparation). We do not discuss N20, M16-7b, or the other
merger models (not presented) further since they all fail to
match the observations.

Focusing on B15 and M15-7b, we investigate what can be
inferred from the remaining differences between the model
predictions and the observations. The property that is easiest to
interpret is the line ﬂux. At early times during the rising phase,
this practically only depends on the column density of electrons
outside the fastest trace amounts of 56Ni on the near side. In
contrast, at later times when the line ﬂuxes are declining, they
are practically only a function of the average absorption
through the ejecta to the bulk of the 56Ni. It is clear from
Figure 4 that the line ﬂuxes of all models fail to capture the
early observed rise before 200days and the fast decline after
400days. The early-time observations most likely imply that
trace amounts of 56Ni were ejected toward us at slightly higher
velocities (more strictly, higher mass coordinate) than what is
seen in the models. The only other (less likely) option is that
there is a thinner “hole” through the envelope that allows some
emission from deeper regions to escape at early times. The late-
time line observations imply that there is more material that
absorbs the direct emission than predicted by the models. This
can be achieved by either larger total ejecta masses or the 56Ni
being preferentially ejected toward the far side away from us.
The line ﬂuxes are closely related to the continuum light
curves. The main difference is that the continuum light curves
depend nontrivially on the optical depths to the radioactive
elements. For example, the continuum emission is quenched for
very high absorption, as well as when approaching the optically
thin regime, because the continuum requires down scattering of
line photons. In conjunction with the observations of the direct
line emission, however,
is straightforward to break this
degeneracy. From Figure 3,
the predicted
45–105keV light curves fail to reach the early observed ﬂuxes
before 200days and overshoot the observed values at times
later than 400days, similarly to the line ﬂuxes. This results in
the same constraints on the distribution of 56Ni as discussed
above, but is still helpful because the continuum data are more
accurate and also provide additional independent observations.
The model spectra at 300days in Figure 2 agree very well
with observations. However, the same early deﬁcits and late
excesses that are seen in the continuum light curves (Figure 3)

is clear that

are of course also present in the spectra at early and late times
(not shown). The difference between predicted spectra and
observations at these times is primarily a change in normal-
ization, which also implies that the continuum light curves in
other energy bands show similar trends as in the presented
45–105keV range. A notable feature in the spectra is the low-
energy cutoff. It can be seen in the right panel of Figure 2 that
the SN1987A models match the spectral break around 20keV.
This is simply a manifestation of the metallicities of the
progenitor envelopes (Section 5.6), which are consistent with
the observed X-ray cutoff.

Finally, we stress two points concerning the magnitude of
the discrepancies between the predictions and the observations.
First, even though the rise of the predicted light curves are too
late (left panels of Figures 3 and 4), the relative difference in
maximum 56Ni velocity required to match data is relatively
low. We ﬁnd that artiﬁcially increasing the radial velocity of all
56Ni by around 20% in the B15 model is sufﬁcient for the
direction-averaged emission to match both the low-energy
continuum and line ﬂux rise.

Second, the difference by a factor of ∼2 in the direct line
ﬂux around 600days (Figure 4) can be remedied by shifting
the 56Ni center of mass. The relevant quantity is the effective
optical depth, and by comparing with the free-escape
asymptote in Figure 4, it is clear that only a slight increase in
the optical depth is sufﬁcient for models to match data. We
make another toy model by taking the original B15 model and
moving the 56Ni center of mass from 214–514kms−1 along
the same direction. This is done by applying a constant shift to
all 56Ni, effectively moving the distribution as a rigid body
within the rest of the ejecta. This results in a relatively good
match with observations at late times. It is only meaningful to
view this model from the minimum direction because a natural
consequence of the modiﬁcation is that the opposite direction
matches the data worse. The increased radial velocity and the
center-of-mass shift of the 56Ni distribution only marginally
affect the spectral shape. It is also worth pointing out that the
aforementioned example of increased mixing and center-of-
mass shift is only one of many possibilities to match the data
due to the large freedom when modifying 3D structures
by hand.

6.3. Future Observations

We make simple predictions for observations of future nearby
SNe by comparing our results with the sensitivity of current
telescopes. The Chandra X-Ray Observatory (Weisskopf et al.
2000, 2002; Garmire et al. 2003) covers soft X-rays below
∼10 keV, NuSTAR covers the 3–79keV range (Harrison et al.
2013; Madsen et al. 2015), and the SPectrometer on INTEGRAL
(SPI; Vedrenne et al. 2003) on board the International Gamma
Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL; Winkler et al. 2003)
extends from 20keV to 8MeV. Even though the effective area
of XMM-Newton (Jansen et al. 2001; Strüder et al. 2001; Turner
et al. 2001) is larger than the effective area of Chandra, their
point-source sensitivities are similar (Figure 6 of Takahashi et al.
2010). For reference, we also include the sensitivity curve of
e-ASTROGAM (De Angelis et al. 2017), which was a candidate
mission for the ESA M5 call and was proposed to operate from
300keV to 3GeV.

For the predictions, we choose a speciﬁc set of three non-
stripped models and the stripped-envelope IIb model. The B15
version used for these predictions is without the metallicity

(dashed–dotted black line, De Angelis et al. 2017). The spectra are at a time of

approximately the times of peak ﬂux in the NuSTAR band. All continuum

correction described in Section 2.3, which means that
effective metallicity is 0.03
. The W15 model is modiﬁed
to Zeff=1.12 
☉Zeff, using solar abundances. In contrast, the
metallicity of the L15 and the IIb models are unmodiﬁed from
their standard values provided in Table 1. We construct this set
of models to illustrate the effects of different metallicities
because of its importance for the low-energy cutoff. The effects
of the metallicity on the direct line ﬂuxes are negligible.

Figure 11 shows predicted spectra overplotted on the
sensitivity curves of the instruments. NuSTAR is expected to
provide the deepest observations. The non-stripped models are
relatively similar and are expected to be detectable by NuSTAR
to around 3Mpc, whereas the limiting distance for the IIb
model is around 10Mpc. This is in agreement with the value of
∼4Mpc given by Harrison et al. (2013) for CCSNe in general.
These distances extend to slightly beyond the Local Group. It is
worth pointing out that the low-metallicity version of B15 has
the photoabsorption cutoff above the Chandra range (our code
does not include the much fainter bremsstrahlung component at
lower energies, Section 4). This means that even metal-free
progenitors do not extend into the soft X-ray regime <10 keV.
Figure 12 shows the computed 847keV line light curves and
the narrow-line sensitivities of INTEGRAL and e-ASTROGAM .
It is clear that INTEGRAL is only capable of detecting the
847keV line out to around 200kpc for the non-stripped SNe.
This effectively limits the range to within the Milky Way and
its satellites. Stripped-envelope SNe are expected to be
to 2Mpc, which covers the Local Group.
detectable out
e-ASTROGAM should expand the horizon by a factor of three,
which would increase the number of potential targets by a
factor of ∼30.

The expected CCSN rate is around 0.1 per year within 3Mpc
and 1 per year within 10Mpc (Arnaud et al. 2004; Ando et al.
2005; Botticella et al. 2012; Horiuchi et al. 2013; Xiao &
Eldridge 2015). Inferred rates based on galaxy properties and

Angelis et al. 2017). The sensitivities are given for a detection threshold of 3σ
and an exposure time of 1Ms.

star formation models are associated with uncertainties. Optical
surveys, however, are possibly also incomplete by ∼20% even
within 10Mpc (Prieto et al. 2012; Jencson et al. 2017, 2018;
Tartaglia et al. 2018). The fraction of stripped-envelope SNe is
estimated to be in the range 0.25–0.35, with reasonable
agreement between estimates based on local SNe observed over
the past decades (Botticella et al. 2012; Mattila et al. 2012;
Horiuchi et al. 2013; Xiao & Eldridge 2015) and surveys of
larger volumes (Smartt et al. 2009; Arcavi et al. 2010; Li et al.
2011; Smith et al. 2011). Thus, a reasonable estimate is that a
CCSN should be detectable by NuSTAR every 3 yr, and the most
likely candidates are stripped-envelope SNe. Finally, we stress
that simply comparing predicted spectra with sensitivity curves
only provides a very rough estimate of what can be detected.
Simulations that
include detailed instrumental effects and
realistic backgrounds will be the subject of future studies.

7. Summary and Conclusions

We use SN models based on 3D neutrino-driven explosion
simulations (Wongwathanarat et al. 2013, 2015, 2017, M.
Gabler et al. 2019, in preparation) to compute the expected
early X-ray and gamma-ray emission. Four of the models are
designed to represent SN1987A; two of these are single-star
BSGs and two are the results of mergers. We compare
predictions from these models to observations of SN1987A to
constrain the model properties. Additionally, we investigate
models of two single-star RSGs and a stripped-envelope IIb
model to extend the results to other types of CCSNe that are
more common than SN1987A-like events. Our main conclu-
sions are as follows:

1. The overall agreement between observations and model
predictions indicates that
the delayed neutrino-heating
mechanism is able to produce SN explosions that are
basically consistent with the X-ray and gamma-ray
observations. General features are well reproduced, such
as the normalization, spectral shape, and shape of the light
curves. We stress that these models are based on realistic
simulations of the progenitors and SN explosions.

2. Both the single-star progenitor B15 and the merger model
M15-7b are capable of reproducing the most relevant
observational X-ray and gamma-ray properties of
SN1987A. M15-7b, however,
is the only progenitor
out of the six merger models of Menon & Heger (2017)
that is able to match the main features of the observations.
Similarly, the single-star model N20 can be excluded.
The primary reason for failing to match the observations
is insufﬁcient mixing of 56Ni to the outer layers, which
related to the growth rates of Rayleigh–Taylor
is
(Wongwathanarat
instabilities during the explosions
et al. 2015; Utrobin et al. 2019, V. Utrobin et al. 2019,
in preparation). This also highlights that X-ray and
gamma-ray observations are a powerful way of con-
straining progenitor models.

3. On a more detailed level, there are differences in the
temporal evolution of the continuum and line ﬂuxes
between the 3D explosion models and SN1987A
observations. A suitable choice of viewing angle is not
sufﬁcient to reconcile these shortcomings. The differ-
ences can, however, be remedied by relatively small
changes to the explosion dynamics. Thus, we do not
consider these discrepancies to be critical issues in the
explosion mechanism. Rather,
they may potentially
provide further insight to reﬁne the progenitor models.
For example, relative to the B15 model, it is sufﬁcient to
increase the velocity of the fastest trace amounts of 56Ni
on the near side by ∼20%, while the bulk of the 56Ni is
redshifted by ∼500kms−1 instead of ∼200kms−1.
This is only one possible explanation, which illustrates
that relatively small changes to the explosion dynamics
and progenitor structures are needed, especially consider-
ing the sensitivity of the dynamics to the progenitor
structure. This issue will be further discussed in a follow-
up paper by A.Jerkstrand et al. (2019, in preparation).
4. The low-energy spectral cutoff is determined by the
photoabsorption opacity of
the progenitor envelope
around 30keV. In our explosion models, the outer parts
of the envelopes are relatively spherical, which means
that the low-energy X-ray cutoff is insensitive to viewing
angle. This is potentially a direct way of observationally
constraining the composition of SN progenitors. The
observations of SN1987A are only weakly constraining,
and we ﬁnd that
the metallicity of its progenitor is
consistent with both the metallicity of the LMC as well as
the metallicity of its equatorial ring.

5. The asymmetries and 3D structures introduce a viewing-
angle dependence, which primarily affects the overall
ﬂux normalization. For the more asymmetric models, the
shapes of the light curves also change signiﬁcantly for
different viewing angles. The shapes of the spectra,
however, remain relatively unaffected. The magnitude of
these effects varies signiﬁcantly depending on the level of
ejecta asymmetries, epoch, and energy range considered.
6. The most important properties that affect the nature of the
X-ray and gamma-ray emission are the amount of 56Ni
mixing and the level of asymmetry. Aside from this,
qualitatively similar progenitor models produce relatively
similar X-ray and gamma-ray emission. The X-ray and
gamma-ray emission of the stripped-envelope IIb model
evolves faster and is more than an order of magnitude
more luminous than the non-stripped models.

17

7. NuSTAR offers the best prospects of future observations
of early X-ray continuum emission from nearby SNe.
Based on simple estimates,
it should be capable of
detecting non-stripped SNe within 3Mpc and stripped-
to 10Mpc, which extends to the
envelope SNe out
nearest galaxies beyond the Local Group. This corre-
sponds to an expected detection rate of 1 CCSN every 3
yr. The deepest observations of direct
line emission
among the current
instruments are provided by INT-
EGRAL/SPI. It is expected to cover non-stripped SNe in
the Milky Way and its satellites, and reach stripped SNe
at 2Mpc, which is comparable to the extent of the Local
Group.
