Baksan Neutrino Observatory (Alekseev et al. 1987; Alexeyev

the formation of a compact object, more than 30 years of

SN1987A would provide valuable insight into the explosion
mechanisms of SNe, the connection between SN progenitors
and compact objects, and the early evolution of neutron stars
(NSs). This has implications for our description of fundamental
physics in the strong-gravity regime.

studies predict

the collapse of a star

Previous studies have been able to indirectly infer some
properties of the compact object in SN1987A. The progenitor
star, Sanduleak−69° 202(Sanduleak 1970), was identiﬁed as
a B3 Ia blue supergiant(Kirshner et al. 1987; Walborn et al.
1987; West et al. 1987; White & Malin 1987). The zero-age
main-sequence mass of the progenitor is estimated to be in the
range 16–22 Me, and the progenitor mass is estimated to be
14 Me at the time of explosion (Fransson & Kozma 2002;
Smartt et al. 2009; Utrobin et al. 2015; Sukhbold et al. 2016).
Most
like
Sanduleak−69° 202 would create an NS, which is supported
by the prompt neutrino burst(Burrows 1988) and SN
simulations (Fryer 1999; Perego et al. 2015; Ertl et al. 2016;
Sukhbold et al. 2016). However, some authors have advanced
the hypothesis that a black hole (BH) was created in
SN1987A(Brown et al. 1992; Blum & Kushnir 2016). The
mass estimates of the possible NS are only loosely constrain-
ing. Early estimates based on the neutrino signal predict a
baryonic NS mass in the range 1.2–1.7 Me(Burrows 1988),
explosion simulations calibrated to SN1987A estimate a
baryonic mass of 1.66 Me(Perego et al. 2015), and a lower
limit on the baryonic mass of 1.7 Me has been placed through
constraints on explosive silicon burning by measuring Ni Fe
ratios(Jerkstrand et al. 2015).

The detection of the compact object is made difﬁcult by the
light from the ejecta and surrounding circumstellar medium
(CSM). The CSM is in the form of a triple-ring structure,

possibly created by a binary merger 20,000 years before
explosion (Blondin & Lundqvist 1993; Morris & Podsia-
dlowski 2007, 2009) or a rapidly rotating progenitor(Chita
et al. 2008). The brightest of the three rings is the inner
equatorial ring (ER), which is seen in Figure 1. It appears

elliptical because it is inclined by
The outer parts of the SN ejecta reached the ER by 1995. The
interactions gave rise to the ﬁrst hotspot(Lawrence et al. 2000)
and the ER subsequently brightened during several years across
the entire electromagnetic spectrum(Ng et al. 2013; Fransson
et al. 2015; Arendt et al. 2016; Frank et al. 2016). However, the
mid-infrared emission from the ER started decreasing in
2010(MIR, Arendt et al. 2016), the optical emission started
decreasing in 2009(Fransson et al. 2015), and the soft X-ray
luminosity flattened around 2013(Frank et al. 2016). The
radiation from central ejecta is also affected by the ER. Larsson
et al. (2011) showed that the brightening of the SN ejecta in the
optical most
likely is explained by the increase of X-ray
emission from the ER. However, the decay of 44Ti is still
expected to be the dominant energy source in the innermost
parts of the ejecta, where the compact object is expected to
reside(Fransson et al. 2013; Larsson et al. 2013).

In this paper, we place limits on the compact object in
SN1987A using observations
from the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at millimeter wave-
the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in near-infrared
lengths,
(NIR), Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in optical and ultraviolet
(UV), and Chandra in X-rays. We then discuss the implications
of the limits on physical properties of the compact object and
prospects for future observations.

This paper is organized as follows. The observations and
data reduction are presented in Section 2 and the analysis
methods are presented in Section 3. We present our compact

results in Section 5. Finally, we summarize and list the main
conclusions in Section 6. In an accompanying paper(Alp et al.
2018), we estimate the X-ray absorption in SN ejecta using
three-dimensional (3D) neutrino-driven explosion models.

2. Observations and Data Reduction

All observations are summarized in Table 1. We use the
most recent observations available at
the time of analysis,
unless previous ones have better quality. It is possible that older
observations place more stringent constraints if the compact
object was brighter in the past. We briefly inspect an X-ray
observation from 2000 (Section 2.6), in addition to a detailed
study of the 2015 X-ray observation, but
investigating all
observations of SN1987A is beyond the scope of this paper.
Some consequences of the temporal evolution of the compact
object are discussed in Section 5.5.

We also analyze a circular polarimetric observation using the
FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph 2 (FORS2) at
the VLT, which did not detect any signiﬁcant polarization. The
polarization observation is presented in Appendix A.

2.1. ALMA

ALMA observations of SN1987A (Table 1) at 1.3mm
(Band 6, 211–275 GHz) were performed on two different
epochs: Cycle 2 modest angular resolution data (2013.1.00280;
23–770 kλ) were obtained on 2014 September 2. The quasar
J0519-4546 (05:19:49.72, −45:46:43.85; 0.75 Jy at 234 GHz)
was the absolute flux calibrator, which is monitored regularly
and calibrated against solar system objects by the observatory.
The quasar J0635-7516 (06:35:46.51, −75:16:16.82; 0.68 Jy at
234 GHz) was the phase calibrator.

(2015.1.00631;

using J0601-7036 (06:01:11.25, −70:36:08.79; 0.70 Jy at
224 GHz; 0.58 Jy at 253 GHz) as
the phase calibrator.
Data from 211 to 213 GHz used J0519-4546 (0.75 Jy at
224 GHz) as the absolute flux calibrator. Data at 247 GHz used
J0519-4546 for one execution, and J0334-4008 (03:34:13.65,
−40:08:25.10; 0.44 Jy at 253 GHz) for a second execution. All
of these quasar calibrators are observed regularly as part of
the observatory calibration network, so we can evaluate the
temporal evolution of each to estimate the uncertainty in the
absolute flux calibrator due to quasar variability. We can then
compare the derived flux densities of the phase calibrator to the
monitoring observations to estimate the uncertainty in fluxscale
transfer
to the science target. These combined yield an
estimated absolute flux calibration uncertainty of better
than 7%.

We use the Common Astronomy Software Application25
(CASA, McMullin et al. 2007) to calibrate and image the
interferometric data into 3 images with spectral ranges deemed
to be largely free of
line emission: 211.83–213.25 GHz,
232.55–233.52 GHz, and 245.95–247.20 GHz(see Figure 2
of Matsuura et al. 2017). For imaging we use the task tclean
with multiscale deconvolution with scales of 0 and 7 times the
62 mas2 pixel size. The FWHM of the restoring beam of
the 213 GHz image is 57×40 mas2 (major and minor axis),
the 233 GHz image 49×30 mas2, and the 247 GHz image
40×34 mas2. Analysis of the phase rms during the observa-
tion with knowledge of the ALMA calibration efﬁcacy(Asaki
et al. 2014) leads us to conclude that the astrometric accuracy is
better than 10 mas. After image reconstruction, the real-space

images are transformed by a linear mapping such that the
beams are circular for optimal performance with the ﬁnding
algorithm, which is described in Appendix B.

2.2. VLT/NACO

SN1987A has been observed for a total of six epochs
between 2006 and 2017 with the Nasmyth Adaptive Optics
System Near-Infrared Imager and Spectrograph (NACO) at the
VLT(Lenzen et al. 2003; Rousset et al. 2003). Full details of
the observations and data reductions are given in A. Ahola
et al. (in preparation). For the present work we selected only a
single epoch of H-band and Ks-band imaging of the highest
image quality (Table 1). The H-band observation is from 2010
October, with a total on-source integration time of 2160 s. The
Ks-band observation is from 2012 December, with a total on-
source integration time of 2070 s.

The images are reduced using standard recipes from the ESO
pipeline(Schreiber et al. 2004; Modigliani et al. 2007) and
IRAF. A horizontal striping pattern present in the images is
removed by a custom script that creates a one-dimensional (1D)
image from the medians of the image pixels along the detector
rows. This 1D image is then subtracted from the rows of the
original image. A running sky subtraction is performed for sets
of three stripe-removed exposures at a time using an ESO
pipeline recipe. The three sky-subtracted exposures are aligned
and stacked by the recipe yielding one sky-subtracted image
per running set of three exposures. This process is repeated
until all of the sets of three exposures have been sky-subtracted
such that N exposures resulted in N − 2 sky-subtracted images.
The sky-subtracted images are ﬁnally aligned based on the
centroid coordinates of a bright star manually selected in each
image and subsequently median-averaged. The stripe removal
script is run once more for the stacked image to remove any
remaining stripes and bands left by the ﬁrst stripe removal step.
Flux calibrations of the NACO observations are made using
star2 as26 a reference. We conﬁrmed that star 2 is not variable
using observations from 1997 to 2006 from the Near Infrared
Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer at
the VLT in the
F160W and F205W ﬁlters. The NACO H and Ks fluxes of
star2 are obtained by converting27 the H and Ks fluxes from
2MASS(Cohen et al. 2003; Skrutskie et al. 2006). The
accuracy of this zero-point construction is checked by repeating
the 2MASS–ESO comparison for star 3.28 The relative
difference in the flux is a factor of 1.06 in the H band and
0.82 in the Ks band. We note that star 3 shows variability
within a factor of two in the optical(Walborn et al. 1993),
which is conﬁrmed by regular HST observations in the R and
B bands over the past two decades.

2.3. VLT/SINFONI

The SINgle Faint Object Near-IR Investigation (SINFONI)
Integral Field Spectrograph at the VLT(Eisenhauer et al. 2003;
Bonnet et al. 2004) observed SN1987A in the H and K bands
between 2014 October and December (Table 1). SINFONI
provides moderate angular
resolution and high spectral
resolution in a small ﬁeld of view (FOV). We only use the
spatial resolution to extract spectra from a search region
(Section 3.2). The limits are then constructed from the

extracted spectra. The data are reduced using the standard
ESO pipeline(Schreiber et al. 2004; Modigliani et al. 2007)
with the improved subtraction of the OH airglow emission
following Davies (2007). A more detailed presentation of the
processing of these particular observations is provided by
Larsson et al. (2016) and a comprehensive description of
SINFONI data reduction can be found in Kjær et al. (2010).
Contaminating light from the ER is subtracted from the
spectra of the central region. The lines from the ER have an
FWHM of ∼300 km s−1 and the lines from the central ejecta
have an FWHM of ∼2500 km s−1(Fransson et al. 2015;
Larsson et al. 2016). Even though the ejecta are clumpy and
illumination is non-uniform, the line proﬁles of the ejecta are
relatively smooth and much broader than the sharp narrow lines
from the ER. The difference allows us to subtract the ER
spectra from the central spectra by scaling the ER spectra such
that they cancel the narrow components of the central spectra.
Backgrounds are constructed from the cleanest available
regions in the relatively small FOV of SINFONI. These are
then subtracted from the extracted central spectra. It is veriﬁed
that different choices of background regions do not signiﬁ-
cantly alter the results. The signal-to-background ratio (S/B)
for the low continuum level is 0.88 in the H band and 2.31 in
the K band.

2.4. HST/WFC3

SN1987A was observed using Wide Field Camera 3
(WFC3) in 2009 December in six ﬁlters; F225W, F336W,
F438W, F555W, F625W, and F814W (Table 1). We choose
these observations from 2009 because they provide the most
complete wavelength coverage at a recent epoch. Together, the
six ﬁlters provide coverage over the 2150–8860Å wavelength
interval. The latest WFC3 NIR observations are from 2011
January in the F110W and F160W ﬁlters. The latest wide-ﬁlter
observations with high quality at the time of analysis are from
2015 May in the F438W and F625W ﬁlters.

All observations were performed using the four-point box
dither pattern and drizzled(Fruchter & Hook 2002) onto a
ﬁnal pixel size of 252 mas2 using a value for the DrizzlePac
(Gonzaga et al. 2012) parameter pixfrac of either 0.6 or 0.7.
Cosmic-ray rejection is also performed when drizzling to
combine the dithered exposures. The flux zero-points for all
WFC3 images are taken from the IRAF/STSDAS package
(Bushouse & Simon 1994, calibration database
Synphot
updated on 2017 January 17).

2.5. HST/STIS

Between 2014 August 16–20,

the HST/Space Telescope
Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) observed SN1987A using the
G750L grating, which covers
the wavelength interval
5300–10000Å (Table 1). The STIS observations were
described in detail in Larsson et al. (2016). Here, we provide
additional information on astrometry and background subtrac-
tion because of their importance to the compact object limit.
The observations were made at ﬁve adjacent slit positions, as
shown in Figure 1. Each slit is 100 mas wide and oriented in
the north–south direction. The position of SN1987A that is
presented in Section 3.1 is very close to the dividing line
between the second and third slits.

Contaminating light from the ring is subtracted from the
spectrum of the central region using the same method used

for SINFONI (Section 2.3). In addition, a background is
extracted from regions north and south of
the SN and
subtracted from the ejecta spectrum. The S/B is 0.74 for the
low continuum level. The background is extracted from 75
pixel rows (50 mas pixel−1) in three regions both north and
south of the SN1987A.

2.6. Chandra

Chandra observed SN1987A on 2015 September 17
(Obs. ID 16756, Table 1), utilizing the Advanced CCD
Imaging Spectrometer(ACIS, Garmire et al. 2003) S-array
equipped with the High-Energy Transmission Grating(HETG,
Canizares et al. 2005). The ACIS detector provides imaging
capabilities with an angular resolution of 700 mas (FWHM)
and a moderate energy resolution of ∼100eV at 2keV. The
spatial resolution is just enough to resolve SN1987A, which
allows us to extract a spectrum of the central region that can be
used to set an upper limit on the compact object. Among many
Chandra observations(e.g., Frank et al. 2016), we choose this
particular observation because it was the latest observation at
the time of analysis, which implies that the absorption toward
the center is the lowest (Appendix C).

Contamination on the ACIS optical blocking ﬁlter(OBF,
O’Dell et al. 2013) has previously led to inaccurate flux
measurements(e.g., Park et al. 2011; Helder et al. 2013). Frank
et al. (2016) have veriﬁed that the OBF contamination is now
well-modeled using the High Resolution Camera/Low Energy
Transmission Grating observation of SN1987A from 2015
March 14 (Obs. ID 16757), which does not suffer from the
OBF contamination. Only data from the zeroth-order image in
energy range 0.3–10keV of the 2015 September 17 ACIS/
HETG observation are used in this analysis.

The data are reduced following standard procedures using
CIAO 4.9 and CALDB 4.7.7(Fruscione et al. 2006). No
background flares are observed resulting in a total exposure of
66ks with ∼11,000 source counts. XSPEC 12.9.1p(Arnaud
1996) is used for the spectral analysis and all extracted spectra
are binned with a minimum of 20 counts per bin. A background
is extracted from an annulus with an inner radius of 15″ and
outer radius of 30″. The background is negligible for the
spectra of SN1987A because of the high source count rates
and small spatial region of interest.

The HETG provides dispersed spectra and also reduces
pileup in the zeroth-order image(Helder et al. 2013; Frank
et al. 2016). The dispersed spectra are used to verify that pileup
is not signiﬁcant in the zeroth-order CCD spectrum and we ﬁnd
that bad grades 1, 5, and 7 combine to be ∼3% of the total level
1 source counts.29 This indicates that the level of pileup is low
enough to not signiﬁcantly affect our analysis. A more detailed
treatment of pileup is difﬁcult because SN1987A is marginally
resolved and we primarily use the spectrum from the region
inside the ER, which is smaller than a single ACIS pixel. Pileup
properties could be different for the ER and the ejecta because
the count rate is signiﬁcantly higher in the pixels neighboring
the few central pixels. However, the grades are assigned based
on 3×3 pixel islands. The way in which these effects combine
requires custom methods, which would be excessive for our
analysis.

3. Methods

Alp et al.

Below, we describe the methods used to determine upper
limits on the compact object in SN1987A. The position of
SN1987A and the spatial regions in which we search for the
compact object are described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.
Sections 3.3–3.5 present how the image and spectral limits at
millimeter, UV, optical, and NIR (UVOIR) wavelengths are
determined. The spread light in the X-ray observation, which
complicates the computation of the X-ray limits, is described in
Section 3.6. Finally, the X-ray ejecta absorption model based
on 3D neutrino-driven SN explosion models(Alp et al. 2018)
is described in Appendix C, and the spatial alignment of the
images is described in Appendix D.

The source luminosity limits based on the imaging analysis
rely on the assumption that the compact object is a point
source. The limits from the spectral analysis in UVOIR are
based on the assumption that the compact object emission is a
continuum. Finally,
the X-ray limits are constructed by
assuming certain spectra for the compact object. The distance
to SN1987A is taken to be 51.2kpc (Panagia et al. 1991;
Gould & Uza 1998; Panagia 1999; Mitchell et al. 2002). All
two-sided conﬁdence intervals are 1σ and all one-sided upper
limits are 3σ unless otherwise stated.

3.1. Position of SN1987A

We need an accurate position estimate of SN1987A because
we only search for the compact object in a kick region that has
a radius of ∼100 mas (Section 3.2). Therefore, it is important
that the position estimate of SN1987A is accurate to ∼10 mas.
The “position of SN1987A” refers to the projected position of
the progenitor
star at current epochs. The position is
determined by ﬁtting an ellipse to the hotspots in the ER in
HST images. This assumes that the progenitor is located at the
center of the ring of hotspots. The ﬁrst step is to tie the HST
images to Gaia data release 1(DR1, Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2016b, 2016a) because the error of
the absolute
astrometry of HST is relatively large. This is done by mapping
two unsaturated stars.30 The uncertainties in the positions of the
1< mas and the
two reference stars in the Gaia archive are
accuracies of the localizations of the stars in the HST images
are a few mas.

All 33 observations from 2003 to 2016 in the B (F435W,
F438W, and F439W) and R (F625W and F675W) bands
(presented in Appendix E) are used for determining the
position. Observations from before 2003 are excluded because
the low number of hotspots present before this time make the
ﬁts inaccurate. The hotspots are deﬁned using the F625W 2006
December 6 observation because it provides the best spatial
resolution at an epoch when most hotspots were bright
(Fransson et al. 2015). Two-dimensional (2D) Gaussians are
ﬁtted to the 26 hotspots, shown in Figure 1. The hotspots are
located in the other observations by ﬁtting a radial, one-
dimensional (1D) Gaussian along the angles deﬁned by the
2D ﬁts in the F625W 2006 December 6 observation. This
ensures that the same hotspots are found in all observations.
Ellipses are then ﬁtted to the hotspots in all
images. The
best-ﬁt estimates of the position of SN1987A from the 33
images agree within 25 mas and are shown in Figure 1 (right).
The arithmetic mean of
the 33 best-ﬁt coordinates are

strapping the hotspot locations. Unless otherwise stated, all
presented coordinates are at epoch J2015.0 and in the reference
frame of Gaia DR1, which is effectively equivalent to ICRF
(the realization of ICRS) for the current level of precision. This
will henceforth be adopted as the position of SN1987A in
this work.

We emphasize that the reported conﬁdence interval only
represents
the statistical uncertainty. Fitting to the ER
continuum in the ALMA observation results in a position
offset of approximately 60 mas to the east, but the ER is more
diffuse at millimeter wavelengths and we choose to use the
optical observations. This is likely to be the best approach
because the hotspots are well-deﬁned point sources, whereas
the millimeter emission originates from a larger volume above
and below the optically emitting ring.

The systematic error introduced by assuming the hotspots to be
located in an ellipse centered on the supernova position is checked
by ﬁtting an elliptic annulus with a Gaussian radial proﬁle to the
entire inner ring. This elliptical band is also allowed to rotate in
the sky plane and has a sinusoidal intensity along the azimuth.
This describes the inner ring as a continuum rather than as a
collection of point sources and serves as a relatively independent
estimate of the position. The center obtained using an elliptical
(ICRF
annulus is
J2015.0), as shown in Figure 1 (right, green pentagon). This
position is offset by 5 mas from the favored position of
SN1987A.

(Kallivayalil et al. 2013; van der Marel & Kallivayalil 2014; van
der Marel & Sahlmann 2016). This assumes that the proper motion
of Sanduleak−69° 202, and consequently also SN1987A,
conforms to the expected motion of its location within the LMC.

3.2. Search Region

An extended region is searched because the compact object
created by SN1987A is expected to have a kick velocity
caused by the asymmetric explosion. Typical 3D kick
velocities of pulsars are ∼400 km s−1(Hobbs et al. 2005;
Faucher-Giguère & Kaspi 2006). However, extreme cases of
velocities up to 1600 km s−1 have been observed(Cordes et al.
1993; Chatterjee & Cordes 2002, 2004; Hobbs et al. 2005).
When searching for a point source in SN1987A, we assume a
sky-plane projected kick velocity of 800 km s−1, which
mas at the epoch of
corresponds to a search radius of
our observations. This is a trade-off between having to search
an excessively large region and the risk of not including the
true source position.

100~

6

The effects of different choices of kick velocity are relatively
small. For a kick of 1600 km s−1, the average correction factor
to the six HST limits from 2009 (Section 4.2) is 1.07. For a
more typical speed of 400 km s−1 the corresponding factor is
0.86. The reason for the small difference is that the brightness
is relatively uniform and the search algorithm is dependent on
both surrounding morphology and brightness. This means that
limits are not directly proportional to the local brightness.

3.3. Reddening

The effect of interstellar reddening at UVOIR wavelengths is
corrected for using the model of Cardelli et al. (1989) with
RV=3.1 and E(B − V )=0.19. The parameters are chosen
based on the work by France et al. (2011), which takes several
studies of extinction to SN1987A and the LMC into
consideration (Fitzpatrick & Walborn 1990; Walker & Suntzeff
1990; Scuderi et al. 1996; Gordon et al. 2003; Michael et al.
2003). The uncertainty in the de-reddening is approximately
20% below 3000Å, less than 10% in the optical, and less than
∼2% in the NIR.

Large amounts of dust have been detected in the ejecta of
SN1987A(Matsuura et al. 2011, 2015; Indebetouw et al.
2014; Dwek & Arendt 2015; Wesson et al. 2015), but we do
not attempt to correct for it using the same method used for
interstellar reddening. The primary reason for this is that the
spatial distribution of the ejecta dust is poorly constrained(e.g.,
Dwek & Arendt 2015; Wesson et al. 2015). Our treatment of
ejecta dust is explained in Section 4.1.

3.4. Image Limits

Image limits are obtained from ALMA, VLT/NACO, and
HST/WFC3. The same method is used for all observations,
apart from two small differences for ALMA. The differences
are how the PSFs of the instruments are determined and how
the spatial positions are chosen. For the interferometric ALMA
images, the PSFs are the well-deﬁned reconstruction beams
(Section 2.1). The PSFs for the UVOIR images are created
using the IRAF/DAOPHOT(Stetson 1987) package following
the guidelines for ﬁtting PSFs in Davis (1994). An empirical
10~ bright,
PSF is generated for each observation by ﬁtting to
well-isolated stars. A Gaussian is selected as the analytical
component with a linear lookup table. The quality of the PSFs
is checked by estimating the residuals when subtracting best ﬁts
from the original images. The residuals are less than 5% of the
counts for most stars. In addition, each individual PSF model is
visually inspected for defects.

The ALMA limits are not required to be from the same point
because they are treated as three independent limits in the
analysis. In contrast, UVOIR image limits from the same epoch
are at the same spatial position for the different bands. The
points are chosen such that the highest total flux allowed by
the limits in all bands is maximized and allows us to combine
the limits to constrain spectra.

The remainder of the process is identical for the ALMA and
UVOIR images. Limits are obtained by introducing artiﬁcial
sources with known fluxes that are recovered using a ﬁnding
algorithm, which is described in Appendix B.

Figure 2. The 2014 SINFONI H and K spectra of the central region of
SN1987A. Both spectra are extracted from regions that correspond to the
800 km s−1 kick region (Section 3.2, Figure 1). The solid black lines are the
upper limits and the dashed black lines are the average flux in the selected
intervals (Section 3.5.1). The spectra have been corrected for spread light from
the ER and background-subtracted(Section 2.3), and corrected for interstellar
reddening(Section 3.3). The observed spectra (blue) have been binned by a
factor of 21 for visual clarity.

3.5. Spectral Limits

The spectra are extracted from regions corresponding to the
800 km s−1 kick region and wavelengths are corrected for the
systematic heliocentric velocity of SN1987A of 287 km s−1
away from Earth(Gröningsson et al. 2008a, 2008b). Limits are
then constructed from spectral regions that are relatively free of
line emission. These regions are assumed to contain contribu-
tions from weak lines, gas continuum emission, and emission
from the compact object. Therefore, the determined limits are
conservative limits on the contribution from the compact
object. We ﬁt functions to the observed flux within the regions
that are free of line emission (Sections 3.5.1 and 3.5.2). The
magnitudes of these functions are then increased until the χ2
values have increased by 7.740. These values are then taken to
be the one-sided 3σ upper limits. We veriﬁed that the reduced
χ2 values are reasonably close to unity, which is required for
this method to be applicable.

3.5.1. NIR Spectral Limits

The upper limits from the SINFONI spectra are set using the
flux density in regions that are free of strong line emission. The
resulting spectra are shown in Figure 2. The regions are
selected to avoid intervals of emission lines identiﬁed in
SN1987A provided in Tables 3 and 4 of Kjær et al. (2007) and
regions of H2 emission(Fransson et al. 2016). Moreover,
wavelength intervals close to residual atmospheric lines are
also excluded. These are clearly seen in observations as narrow
lines. In total, 16% of all data pass the aforementioned selection
criteria in the H band; for the K band, 28% pass the criteria. We
combine many very narrow intervals into four groups and
deﬁne constant functions within the groups (Figure 2). We
choose four regions because the speciﬁc flux is relatively
constant within the regions. The constant values are the
averages within each group, which are then increased to a 3σ
upper-limit level.

Figure 3. The 2014 STIS spectrum of the central region of SN1987A. The
extraction region is a rectangle that approximately contains the 800 km s−1
kick region (Section 3.2, Figure 1). The solid black line is the power law that
represents the 3σ upper limit to continuum emission from a compact object.
The dashed black line is the best-ﬁt power law, which is a factor of 2.1 lower
than the limit. The gray regions indicate the wavelength intervals in which the
power law is ﬁtted. The spectra have been corrected for spread light from the
ER and background-subtracted(Section 2.5), and corrected for interstellar
reddening(Section 3.3). The observed spectrum (blue) is smoothed by a factor
of 11 for visual clarity. The orange line is a model spectrum of SN1987A
taken from Jerkstrand et al. (2011) normalized to Hα. This model is only used
for identifying regions that are free of line emission.

3.5.2. Optical Spectral Limit

in the ﬁt

To determine the compact object

limit using the STIS
observation, a spectrum is extracted from the search region.
Because of the resolution of the instrument, the spectrum is
from a region with a width of two 100 mas slits and height of
ﬁve 50 mas pixels, which is approximately equivalent to a
rectangle that just contains the 800 km s−1 extraction region
(Figure 1). A power law is ﬁtted to regions that are free of
strong lines (gray regions in Figure 3). The power
law
describes the quasicontinuum well within the STIS wavelength
range 5300–10000Å, which is why we do not use the same
(Section 3.5.1). No signiﬁcant
method as for SINFONI
improvement
is seen for other simple functional
forms. The selected regions that are relatively free from line
emission are 6025–6100, 6850–6950, and 7550–7650Å. The
average flux in the middle region is slightly higher, but
excluding it results in a ∼10% less constraining limit because
of the reduced statistics. The regions are found by visual
inspection of the observed spectrum and by searching the
model spectrum of Jerkstrand et al. (2011) for regions free of
strong lines. The model computes an observed spectrum by
simulating the radiation transfer through the SN ejecta, which is
assumed to be powered by the radioactive decay of 44Ti. We
note that the predicted spectrum was summed over the entire
ejecta and worse agreement is expected for the smaller search
region. The model is only used to identify line-free regions and
it is included in Figure 3 for reference.

3.6. X-Ray Limits

To determine the X-ray flux limit on the compact object, the
ER emission needs to be modeled. This is important because
the observed flux in the inner region is dominated by spread
light from the ER. We use spread light to refer to the result of

best-ﬁt ellipse. The outer region is deﬁned as an inclined
elliptical annulus with the inner region as the inner boundary.
The semimajor axis of the outer boundary of the outer region
is 10″.

An ER spectrum is extracted from the outer region and a
central spectrum from the inner region, henceforth referred to
as the ejecta spectrum. The ejecta spectrum has a total photon
count of 624. The option to correct for the encircled energy
(EE) of the CIAO task specextract is disabled. Instead, the
correction factor for the inner region is computed to be 0.46
using the simulated MARX PSF. The value of 0.46 is
computed for a point source at the center and will be used to
correct for the missing flux throughout this analysis. No EE
correction is applied to the outer region because the physical
flux of the ER is not of interest. This method is employed
because it allows for ﬁtting of the fraction of spread light,
which can then be directly compared to the modeled fraction of
spread light.

Light from the bright ER contaminates the central region of
SN1987A in the Chandra observations. We estimate the
fraction of spread light ( fs) using the spatial model and
compare it to the observed value, which is obtained by spectral
ﬁtting. The fraction of spread light is deﬁned as the ratio of
spread light flux in the inner region to the flux in the outer
region. The value f
is computed using the
s
spatial model with no central source. The model is forward-
folded using the PSF to simulate the angular response of the
detector and the uncertainties are obtained by simulations using
the ﬁtted model. We assume that the energy dependence of the
EE is relatively weak, implying that the spectrum of the spread
light in the inner region is the same as the spectrum of the ER
itself. This assumption is partially motivated by the fact that the
energy dependence is modest over the range covered by the
bulk of the photons. Additionally, the small angular separations

Section3.2 of Park et al. (2010) for a more detailed treatment

3.6.3. Observed Spread Light Fraction

The observed fraction of spread light can be determined by
extracting spectra from both the ER and the inner region, and
then ﬁtting the model
that describes the ER to the inner
spectrum, with only the normalization left free to vary. This
needs to be done because there might be a signiﬁcant
contribution from the compact object in the observation, which
is assumed to have a spectrum different from that of the ER.
The model we use for the ER spectrum consists of an ISM
absorption component and three source components; an
ionization equilibrium collisional plasma (vequil) at a
temperature of 0.3keV, a constant-temperature plane-parallel
shock plasma model (vpshock) at a temperature of 2.1keV,
and a power-law component. ISM absorption of all
three
components is modeled using the tbgrain(Wilms et al. 2000)

angular blurring of telescopes, also referred to as wings, leaked
light, scattered light, or glare. The spatial model allows for
computation of the amount of spread light in the inner region.
Finally, the limits are set by spectral ﬁtting to the spectrum
from the inner region with a model that includes the spread
light from the ER.

We also briefly inspected the 61 ks ACIS observation from
2000 December 7 (Obs. ID 1967) and ﬁnd that the X-ray limits
allow for approximately a factor of two higher luminosities
because of the higher ejecta absorption (Appendix C). It is
unlikely that more stringent limits can be placed using the High
Resolution Camera on board Chandra because of the very poor
energy resolution, which prevents separation of emission from
the ER.

3.6.1. Spatial Modeling

The remnant is ﬁtted with an ellipse of sinusoidal intensity
along the azimuth and Gaussian radial proﬁles, and is then
folded through the modeled instrumental PSF. This is just a
model used to describe the observed morphology of the ER. A
description of the simulation of the Chandra PSF is provided in
Appendix F. The inner region covering the central ejecta is
excluded from the ﬁt to reduce the effects of any contribution
from a central source. Observations show ﬁner structure than
allowed by this simple model. Therefore, the pixels of the
unfolded model are given some freedom by assigning new
values that are distributed as normal distributions, with the
mean set to the original value and standard deviation set to one-
third of the original value. Any negative values are set to zero.
The random reassignment of pixels is performed 10,000 times
and the folded model that gives the maximum likelihood for the
observed data is chosen, as shown in Figure 4. The goodness of
ﬁt is determined by simulating 100,000 observations from the
folded best-ﬁt model. A total of 53,039 simulations resulted in
a higher statistical likelihood than the real observation, showing
that the ﬁt is acceptable.

An inner and an outer region are deﬁned using the best-ﬁt
model. These are the regions from which spectra are extracted.
The inner region (Figure 4) is deﬁned as an inclined ellipse
with parameters given by the ﬁtted model: a position angle of
83° to the semimajor axis (deﬁned counter-clockwise from
north) and a ratio of semimajor to semiminor axis of 1.37. The
magnitude of the semimajor axis of the inner region is set to
450 mas, which is chosen to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N) of a central point source. This can be compared to the
870 mas semimajor axis and 620 mas semiminor axis of the

by many previous X-ray studies of SN1987A, which neglected
the molecular component. We note that
this only makes a
difference of ∼3% for our results because of the high ejecta
absorption. For this reason, we also ignore any CSM or LMC
absorption. The power

the model is only to represent the spread light from the ER into
the central region. The ﬁt statistic for the ER spectrum is

We then ﬁt the ER model to the ejecta spectrum, with all
parameters frozen apart from a constant factor. This represents
an upper limit on the spread light from the ER into the central
region because it is implicitly assumed that the contribution
from the compact object
is negligible. The ﬁt statistic is
for 27d.o.f. and the fraction of spread light to ER
2c =
flux is 0.062±0.003, which can be compared to the value of

predicted by the model. The goodness of ﬁt implies
that the energy dependence of the EE is small enough to be
neglected in this case. The observed value is marginally lower
than predicted and implies that practically all flux observed in
the central region can be interpreted as spread light from the
ER. The purpose of comparing the modeled and observed fs is
that an observed value that is signiﬁcantly higher than predicted
would indicate an additional contribution in the central region.

3.6.4. Calculating X-Ray Limits

We construct X-ray limits on the compact object by adding
components to the ER spectrum model and re-ﬁtting the model
to the ejecta spectrum. Then, we ﬁnd the limiting value for a
parameter of interest of the additional component while ﬁtting
fs and freezing all other parameters. Leaving additional
parameters free is not possible because the low number of
counts in the ejecta region is insufﬁcient
to meaningfully
constrain additional parameters. The additional component
represents the contribution from the compact object and the
SN ejecta absorption (Appendix C) is only applied to this
component using the tbvarabs(Wilms et al. 2000) photo-
absorption model. The presented results are obtained using the
Levenberg–Marquardt ﬁtting algorithm and the χ2 statistic. We
also attempted an unbinned analysis using the Cash-statistic
(Cash 1979), but found differences that are much smaller than
other uncertainties.

4. Results

We describe our model of the ejecta dust absorption in
Section 4.1, which is relevant for the results from the UVOIR
observations, but not
the other wavelengths. The direct
millimeter, UVOIR, and X-ray limits are then presented in
Sections 4.2–4.4. In Section 4.5, we present the bolometric
limits, which are partly dependent on the UVOIR observations.

Therefore, we provide bolometric limits for both dust-free and
dust-obscured lines of sight.

4.1. UVOIR Dust Absorption

´

1016

The effects of absorption by ejecta dust are important in
UVOIR. The dust is assumed to have a negligible impact on the
millimeter observations and have the same absorption proper-
ties as gas in the X-ray regime(Morrison & McCammon 1983;
Draine 2003; Alp et al. 2018). Large amounts of dust have been
observed in SN1987A (Lakićević et al. 2011, 2012a; Matsuura
et al. 2011, 2015; Indebetouw et al. 2014; Dwek & Arendt
2015; Wesson et al. 2015; Bevan 2018) and there is evidence
that the dust resides in clumpy structures (Lucy et al. 1989,
1991; Fassia et al. 2002; Jerkstrand et al. 2011). The latter
means that the dust is modeled as a covering factor and not an
average optical depth. The diameters of
the clumps of
mas (1000 km s−1
100~
molecules have been observed to be
cm, Abellán et al. 2017), but it is possible that the
or 8
size of the dust clumps is different from the clumps of
molecules. The covering factor has been estimated to be 50%–
70% by observing asymmetries of emission lines and spectral
modeling (Lucy et al. 1989, 1991; Wooden et al. 1993; Wang
et al. 1996; Fassia et al. 2002; Jerkstrand et al. 2011).

the ejecta dust

The information about

in SN1987A is
insufﬁcient for detailed corrections. In particular, the 3D SN
explosion models used for
the X-ray absorption estimate
(Appendix C) cannot be used for the dust because dust
formation, composition, and geometry depend on additional
unconstrained parameters(e.g., Bevan 2018).
Instead, we
assume that our
in
SN1987A is free of ejecta dust clumps when placing limits
in UVOIR. If there is a dust clump along our line of sight to a
compact object, then essentially all UVOIR emission from the
compact object would be absorbed and the presented direct
UVOIR limits would not apply.

line of sight

However, we consider the reprocessing of the absorbed
UVOIR emission in the dust-obscured case in Section 4.5,
where we obtain bolometric limits based on the energy budget
the dust
of the ejecta. We assume that
is optically thick
throughout
the spectrum because no
the UVOIR part of
indications of energy- or time-dependent attenuation have been
observed with VLT/SINFONI (since 2005) or HST (since
1994, Larsson et al. 2013, 2016).

4.2. Millimeter and UVOIR Image Limits

We compute upper

limits on the compact object

in
SN1987A at millimeter wavelengths using the ALMA images.
An image of the observation at 213 GHz is shown in Figure 5
and the limits are provided in Table 2. The ER and central
ejecta structure are clearly resolved and no obvious point
source is seen in any of the ALMA images. The level of
spatially extended emission in the central region is comparable
to the noise level. The high noise level is a consequence of
constructing images of narrow frequency spans of 1–2 GHz
(Section 2.1).

The upper limits in UVOIR are shown in Figure 6 and listed
in Table 3. There are limits in six ﬁlters from 2009; F225W,
F336W, F438W, F555W, F625W, and F841W. The more
constraining limits in the B and R bands are the 2015
observations. The four NIR limits are: WFC3 F110W and
F160W from 2011, and NACO H from 2010 and Ks from 2012.

4.3. UVOIR Spectral Limits

The SINFONI H and K spectra from the central region and
limits on the compact object are shown in Figures 2 and 6. The
limits for the individual wavelength intervals are listed in
Table 3. We note that the four intervals are for presentation
only and are groups consisting of many narrow ranges, which
are used to compute the limits (Section 3.5.1). Images of the
selected wavelength intervals that are relatively free of line
emission are also studied and no clear point source is seen in
the resolved image of the ejecta. The spatial distribution of the
emission in the central regions of the ejecta in the continuum
images is essentially uniform at the resolution of SINFONI in
both the H and K bands.

The STIS spectrum for the central region of SN1987A is

observation from 2014 June 15 in the B band (contours). The dotted white
circle is the search region (Section 3.2) and the 57×40 mas2 beam is shown in
the lower right corner. The pixel size is 62 mas2 and the off-source rms noise is
0.02~

mJybeam−1.

Figure 6. Limits in UVOIR on a point source in SN1987A inside a kick region
corresponding to 800 km s−1. The gray lines are spectral limits. Image limits
from left to right are as follows: F225W, F336W, F438W, F555W, F625W,
F814W, F110W, F160W, NACO H, and NACO Ks. The less strict limits in
F438W and F625W are from 2009 and are simultaneous with the other optical
image limits, whereas the stricter F438W and F625W limits are from 2015.
Limits from the same epoch are from the same spatial position. The dashed
orange line is a blackbody spectrum for the temperature and radius of the Sun
scaled to the distance of SN1987A. This can be taken as a limit on a surviving
main-sequence companion if our line of sight is free of dust(Section 5.6). The
dashed–dotted yellow line is the assumed conservative spectrum corresponding
to a luminosity of 6.6 Le used for the bolometric limit (Section 4.5).

are more constraining than image limits at corresponding
frequencies.

4.4. X-Ray Limits

X-ray limits on the compact object are set using the 2015
September 17 Chandra/ACIS observation and the ejecta
absorption estimate from the SN model B15 (Appendix C).
We investigate the standard blackbody model,
the XSPEC
thermal model nsmaxg(Mori & Ho 2007; Ho et al. 2008), and
two power laws with photon indices (G) of 1.63, corresponding
to the Crab Pulsar, and 2.108, corresponding to the Crab
Nebula(Willingale et al. 2001). The nsmaxg model describes
thermal emission from an NS for different atmospheric
compositions and magnetic ﬁeld strengths. We only explore
the case of a NS with a carbon atmosphere and a magnetic ﬁeld
strength of 1012G. A carbon-atmosphere model was reported
to ﬁt the NS in CasA(Ho & Heinke 2009; Posselt et al. 2013).
See Figure 2 of Ho & Heinke (2009) for a comparison of
different atmospheric compositions. Apart from the spread light
fraction, only the temperature is allowed to vary for the two
thermal components and the normalization for the two power
laws. The remaining parameters are frozen under the assump-
tions (discussed in Section 5.3.1) of a gravitational mass of
1.4 Me, local (unredshifted) NS radius of 10km, and uniform
emission from the entire surface. The assumed mass and radius
give a gravitational redshift factor of 0.766.

All X-ray limits are listed in Table 4. The presented effective
surface temperatures (T) are given in the local (unredshifted)
frame. The parameter (K¥) is the XSPEC power law normal-
ization and is given in the observed frame (“at inﬁnity”). The
luminosities (L¥) are also given in the observed frame to
facilitate comparisons with other observational studies. The
luminosities for
the thermal components are bolometric,
whereas the power-law luminosities are given for the observed
2–10keV range.

The limits for the standard blackbody and the Γ=1.63
power law are given for three different levels of SN ejecta
absorption. The selected amounts are the average, 10th
percentile, and 90th percentile of the optical depth. The general
trends for the two thermal components and the two power laws

are the same;
the difference between the 10th and 90th
percentiles is a factor of ∼2 in luminosity for the thermal
components and ∼3 for the power laws. Absorption by the ISM
is always included, but we also provide limits for no SN ejecta
absorption. This represents the minimum amount of absorption,
in case the SN explosion model describes SN1987A poorly
and we happen to have a very favorable line of sight.

The reason for the extremely high limiting temperatures and
luminosities of the thermal models is that the high optical
depths at energies below ∼4keV effectively absorb all
emission. We point out that an important factor to the thermal
components crossing the detection threshold is the shift of the
emission toward higher energies where the optical depth is
lower. The power-law models are more constrained in the sense
that the limiting luminosity in the 2–10keV range is much
lower because the power-law components extend to higher
energies.

4.5. Bolometric Limit

The bolometric luminosity of the compact object can be
constrained by the total energy budget of SN1987A. The
energy inputs are radioactive decay of 44Ti and the unknown
contribution from the compact object. The energy outputs are
far-infrared (FIR) dust emission and UVOIR de-excitation and
recombination emission lines. Detailed models of SN1987A
predict that much of the emission powered by 44Ti would
emerge as ﬁne structure lines in MIR(Jerkstrand et al. 2011),
but observations severely constrain these lines (Lundqvist et al.
2001; Bouchet et al. 2006). This implies that the MIR emission
is reprocessed and escapes as thermal dust emission in the
submillimeter to FIR(Matsuura et al. 2011, 2015; Indebetouw
et al. 2014; Dwek & Arendt 2015).

The lifetime of 44Ti is τ=85.0 years (half-life of 58.9 years,
Ahmad et al. 2006) and decays into 44Sc, which emits 596-keV

fraction is slightly higher at
than at 2875days, which is what was modeled by Jerkstrand
et al. (2011). A higher ionization fraction results in a higher
heating fraction(Figure 5 of Kozma & Fransson 1992).

The emission processes relevant for the compact object are
thermal surface emission, accretion, or pulsar wind activity. We
assume that
the emission is dominated by X-ray emission
below 10keV, which is absorbed locally because of the high
optical depth(Alp et al. 2018) and escapes as thermal dust
emission or UVOIR lines. Both surface emission and accretion
would be observed as unresolved point sources. Chevalier &
Fransson (1992) investigated the early evolutions of young
pulsars and their effect on the surrounding ejecta and found that
–800 km s−1 for a pulsar
the bubble expansion velocity is
luminosity of 1039 erg s−1 above 13.6eV. The current limits on
the compact object constrains the luminosity, and consequently
the expansion velocity, to be orders of magnitude lower. For
expansion velocities less than ∼100 km s−1, it is reasonable to
treat a possible pulsar wind nebula (PWN) as a point source.
Assuming the compact object to be point-like allows us to
separate the cases where the line of sight is free of dust and
dust-obscured, and use the point-source image limits in the
dust-free case.

500~

In the case where our line of sight is free of dust, we assume
that 70% of the input from the compact object goes into heating
and the remaining 30% escapes as UVOIR emission lines.
These fractions are distinct from those for the positron input,
but we assume them to be the same(Kozma & Fransson 1992;
Jerkstrand et al. 2011). We do not consider further reprocessing

of the energy that goes into heating, which most likely escapes
as thermal dust emission(Bouchet et al. 2006; Jerkstrand et al.
2011). The compact object is situated in the central regions
where the photoabsorption is dominated by iron(Figure 2 of
Alp et al. 2018), which implies that the line spectrum of the
reprocessed emission from the compact object could be
different from that of the 44Ti-powered ejecta. Therefore, we

in the least constraining limit. The wavelength range covers the
region where many of
lines are expected to
escape(Figures 3–5 of Jerkstrand et al. 2011) and longer
wavelengths are strongly constrained by the limits (Figure 6
and Table 3). The flux limit corresponds to an allowed UVOIR
luminosity of 6.6 Le, which for the assumed heating fraction of
70% results in a bolometric limit of 22 Le. The epoch of this

5. Discussion

All limits on the compact object in SN1987A presented in
Section 4 apply to both NSs and BHs. However, the expected
emission characteristics for the two classes of objects are very
different. This discussion primarily focuses on NSs because
the creation of an NS in SN1987A
most studies favor
(Section 1) and NSs power a wider diversity of physical

is a dust-obscured thermally emitting NS
(Section 5.7). The discussion is organized as follows. We
compile literature limits for a comprehensive overview of
SN1987A observations across the entire electromagnetic
spectrum in Section 5.1 and compare our limits with previous
works in Section 5.2. The implications of the limits based on
direct observations for thermal surface emission are discussed
in Section 5.3.1, accretion is discussed in Section 5.3.2, and
pulsar activity is discussed in Section 5.3.3. We relate the
bolometric limit to physical parameters in Section 5.4 and
extrapolate the limits to other epochs using simple models in
Section 5.5. Lastly, we explore constraints on a possible binary
main-sequence companion in Section 5.6, remaining possibi-
lities for the compact object in Section 5.7, and briefly look into
future prospects in Section 5.8.

5.1. Global Limits

Limits on a point source collected from the literature are
included to give a complete coverage over
the entire
electromagnetic spectrum. We only include literature limits at
frequencies not covered by this work. Limits covering the same
bands as our limits are instead discussed in Section 5.2. An
overview of limits at all frequencies is shown in Figure 7. More
details on the literature limits are provided in Table 6. We
categorize the limits based on the methods employed.
Unresolved imaging in this context implies that the ER and
ejecta are not spatially resolved. These limits are just the total
flux of
resulting in very
conservative limits. The unresolved radio limit is dominated
by ejecta-ER interactions(Callingham et al. 2016), unresolved
IR limits by thermal dust emission(Matsuura et al. 2015;

Arendt et al. 2016), unresolved X-ray limits most likely by

limits most likely by spread light from the nearby objects
N157B and 30DorC(H.E.S.S. Collaboration et al. 2015;
Ackermann et al. 2016). Super-resolved implies that images are
restored using a deconvolution algorithm, which introduces
additional assumptions and is model-dependent in some cases.
This is especially unreliable because the compact object is
surrounded by bright ejecta(e.g., White 1994). Resolved
images clearly distinguish the ER from the central ejecta and
are the most robust measurements. The VLT/SINFONI, HST/
STIS, and Chandra/ACIS limits from this work are based on
spectra, whereas all other limits are determined using images.
The radio limits of Potter et al. (2009) and Zanardo et al.
(2013) in Table 6 are referred to as estimates. These are excess
sources inside the ER that were interpreted as possible
indications of a pulsar. However,
the evidence remains
inconclusive and we are not able to compare our limits with
their observations.

5.2. Comparison with Previous Limits

Earlier studies have presented limits on the compact object in
SN1987A in (sub-)mm, optical, UV, and X-rays. Zanardo
et al. (2014) discussed the possibility of a PWN with a flux of
3mJy in the range 102–672 GHz. This is not directly
comparable to our limits of ∼0.1mJy at 213–247 GHz because
our limits apply to point sources and a PWN might be spatially
extended (cf. Figure 5).

Graves et al. (2005) placed limits in optical and UV using
data from HST. The image limits from Graves et al. (2005) are
lower than ours by approximately a factor of 2, but the STIS

14

30%~

more constraining than
limit presented in this work is
any previous limit in the same wavelength range. There are
numerous factors that contribute to the differences. Their STIS
spectrum is from 1999 December and images are from 2003
November taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS),
resolution than WFC3. Our
which has a higher angular
observations are from later epochs, which implies that
the
ejecta have expanded signiﬁcantly, the shock interactions with
the ER have evolved,
the ER X-ray illumination has
increased(Larsson et al. 2011), and our search region needs
to be larger. Additionally, slightly different values for the
reddening and equivalent widths of the ﬁlters are used, as well
as a different search algorithm (Appendix B). We veriﬁed that
the combined effect of all factors explains the differences
between our limits and those of Graves et al. (2005).

are approximately an order of magnitude less constraining than
previous X-ray limits because we use a more realistic model of
the soft X-ray photoabsorption of the SN ejecta based on 3D
neutrino-driven SN explosion models(Alp et al. 2018). We
also employ a method (Section 3.6) that uses the angular

5.3. Model Comparisons

5.3.1. Thermal Emission

The direct

limits do not strongly constrain the surface
temperature of an NS (Tables 4 and 5). The remainder of this
section provides the information needed to draw this conclu-
sion. We note that more constraining limits are obtained from
the bolometric limits (Sections 5.4 and 5.7).

To relate the surface temperature of an NS to observed
luminosity, it is necessary to adopt a mass and radius. We
assume a gravitational mass of 1.4 Me and a local (unred-
shifted) radius of 10km for an NS in SN1987A. Recent best
estimates based on Bayesian analyses of low-mass X-ray
binaries(Steiner et al. 2013), nuclear physics and observational
constraints on the NS equation of state(Hebeler et al. 2013),
and the binary NS merger GW170817(Bauswein et al. 2017)
favor radii in the range 11–13km; see also Figure 10 of Özel &
Freire (2016). The primary reason for choosing a radius of
10km is that the limits are more conservative because all
reported temperature limits decrease for an increasing NS
radius and ﬁxed mass. The decrease in limiting temperature for
a radius of 12km is approximately a factor of 0.89 for T and
0.94 for T¥, because of the different dependencies on the
gravitational redshift factor.

2.5»¥

3.3» MK (T

Typical surface temperatures of young NSs are of the order
of a few million Kelvin and correspond to spectral peaks at soft
X-ray energies of ∼1keV. The characteristic temperature for a
given NS age depends on the relatively unknown cooling
properties of NSs(Yakovlev & Pethick 2004). For an NS at
30 years that has not undergone thermal relaxation, a typical
temperature is T
MK, Gnedin et al. 2001;
Shternin & Yakovlev 2008; Page et al. 2009; Klochkov et al.
2015). A more extreme case is for an NS with a carbon heat
4.1» MK
blanket. Carbon is more heat transparent and gives T
MK, Yakovlev et al. 2011; Klochkov et al. 2015).
(T
These values are at the high end of temperatures predicted for
an NS in SN1987A. If thermal relaxation has started, the
temperature would decrease quickly at current epochs(Gnedin
et al. 2001; Yakovlev & Pethick 2004; Shternin & Yakovlev
2008; Page et al. 2009).

Limits on thermal emission from an NS in SN1987A based
on the X-ray observation are provided in Tables 4 and 5. The
X-ray limits constrain thermal spectra much more strictly than
the UVOIR limits. The limiting temperatures are approximately
8 MK for all expected levels of ejecta absorption and NS
atmospheres. This is clearly above the predicted values of
T
the direct observations do not
exclude any models. Thus, a scenario where SN1987A created
a central compact object(e.g., Posselt et al. 2013; Bogdanov
2014) is consistent with the observational limits.

5.3.2. Accretion

It is possible that the compact object is accreting a signiﬁcant
amount of matter. An extensive study of many different
accretion scenarios was made by Graves et al. (2005, their
Sections 5 and 6),
to which the reader is referred for a
comprehensive analysis of accretion in SN1987A. We restrict
our discussion of accretion to the simplest model with the

purpose of estimating the luminosity, and ﬁnd that most
predictions for fallback are excluded unless the accretion
efﬁciency is less than 0.03 (cf. Section 5.5).

The simplest accretion model is to assume that a signiﬁcant
amount of the gravitational binding energy of the infalling
material is converted into radiation. The accretion luminosity
(La) is then given by

where η is the accretion efﬁciency, M˙ is the accretion rate, and
c is the speed of light in vacuum. A typical accretion efﬁciency
for an NS of mass 1.4 Me and radius 10km,
is
assuming the accreted gas radiatively cools efﬁciently(e.g.,
McCray 1979). The efﬁciency of accretion onto BHs is more
model-dependent. Possible values of BH accretion efﬁciencies
range from 10−10 for spherically symmetric accretion(Shapiro
1973)
to 0.4 for disk accretion(Frank et al. 2002). For
reference, the Eddington luminosity (LEdd) for an object of

mass 1.4 Me is 1.8

This relies on some standard assumptions that are inapplicable
in this case, but we choose to use the Eddington luminosity as a
unit for comparison with other works.
The amount of fallback onto NSs after SN explosions has
been estimated to 0.1 Me, which mostly accrete on timescales
1 year (Chevalier 1989; Houck & Chevalier 1991; Brown
of
& Weingartner 1994; Chatterjee et al. 2000). Brown &
Weingartner (1994) estimated that a mass of 10−4–10−3 Me
remains bound to the NS in SN1987A after ∼3years.
Relevant timescales for accretion of this remaining mass are
1000
years, and it is possible that most of the remaining mass
is expelled(Houck & Chevalier 1991; Chatterjee et al. 2000).
As an example, we assume a relatively conservative fallback
mass of 10−5 Me that is uniformly accreted over 104 yr. This
results in an accretion rate of 10−9 Me yr−1, which corresponds

5.3.3. Magnetic Field and Rotation

We constrain the surface magnetic ﬁeld strength (B) and
rotational period (P) of an NS in SN1987A using a simple
model of a rotation-powered PWN and assuming spectra in the
form of the Crab Nebula and Pulsar. An analog of the Crab
Nebula or the Crab Pulsar in SN1987A is ruled out even if our
line of sight is dust-obscured (Table 5).

The total

luminosity of an NS can be modeled by a
rotating magnetic dipole in vacuum(e.g., Equation (10.5.4) of

Several assumptions have implicitly been made; the rotation
axis and the magnetic dipole axis are orthogonal and the
dominating source of energy is the rotational energy of the NS.
We follow the convention of letting the “surface” magnetic
ﬁeld strength be the magnetic equator ﬁeld strength and using
the vacuum formula (e.g.,
the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue,
Manchester et al. 2005). The magnetic ﬁeld strength at the
magnetic poles is a factor of two higher. We also note that the
force-free magnetic dipole formula would imply 1.7 times
lower magnetic ﬁeld strengths than the vacuum formula for
orthogonal rotation and magnetic axes(Spitkovsky 2006). In
the simplest picture, the energy emitted by the NS is deposited
into the surroundings where it
is reprocessed. We do not
attempt to model the complex interactions that generate the
observed spectrum of a PWN. Instead, we assume that the
deposited energy emerges with the spectrum of the Crab
Nebula or
the Crab Pulsar, and study these two cases
separately. The spectrum of the pulsar is the pulsed component,
which corresponds to radiation originating predominantly from
the immediate surroundings of the pulsar and to a lesser extent
from the pulsar itself. The Crab is one of the most extreme
sources in the sky and it is not a typical PWN. For a high-
energy comparison of the pulsed emission, see Figure 28 of
Kuiper & Hermsen (2015), and for a multiwavelength
comparison of the Crab and PSRB0540-69.3, see Figure 15
of Seraﬁmovich et al. (2004). However, the Crab is relatively
young, well-observed, and frequently used as a reference. The
physical scenario is that an NS created by SN1987A is a pulsar
that drives a younger and smaller analog of the Crab in the SN
remnant.

With Equation (4) and a spectral shape, we can compute the
region in the BP-plane that is allowed by the upper limits. This
is done by taking the Crab Nebula spectrum and the Crab
Pulsar spectrum, scaling to the distance of SN1987A, and then
scaling the spectra such that they are consistent with the limits
(seeFigure 7). If our line of sight is free of dust, both spectra
are constrained by the SINFONI data point at 1.7 μm,
otherwise the nebula spectrum is constrained by the 213 GHz
limit and the pulsar spectrum is constrained by the Γ=1.63
X-ray power-law limit. We only use the new limits presented in
this work and we assume that a PWN is point-like (Section 4.5,
and Chevalier & Fransson 1992). The allowed luminosities
´ - of the Crab
vary from 3 Le, corresponding to 8.2
Nebula, to 830 Le, corresponding to 0.42 of the Crab Pulsar
(Table 5). The luminosities can be translated to limits in the
BP-plane by rearranging Equation (4). The local (unredshifted)
radius is taken to be 10km. The limits span a range from
B < 1.8 × 1013 P2 G s−2 to B
G s−2, and are
included in Table 5 and shown in Figure 8. The limits are all
relatively low and any possible PWN activity is most likely
very weak.

solid line is the limit from direct observations for a Crab Nebula spectrum in
the dust-free case and the dotted line is for a Crab Pulsar spectrum obscured by
dust. These limits are chosen because they are the two extremes, implying that
all other BP-plane limits are covered within the range. The shaded extensions
that are partially horizontal correspond to the respective lines but for constraints
on birth values of B and P for an assumed temporal evolution (see Section 5.5).
The color map represents the current luminosity of a rotating dipole in vacuum
as modeled by Equation (4) as a function of birth values of B and P.

5.4. Energy Budget

The bolometric limit on the compact object in SN1987A is
22 Le at 8329 days (2009 December) if our line of sight is free
of dust and 138 Le at 9090 days (2012 January) in the dust-
rely on many assumptions
obscured case. The limits
(Section 4.5) and the direct observations are arguably less
model-dependent. The direct-observation limits and the bolo-
metric limits can be viewed as independent
limits on the
in SN1987A. All constraints on physical
compact object
parameters are provided in Table 5. Only the bolometric limits
on the effective temperature are substantially more constraining
than the corresponding direct-observation limits.

it can be taken as an indication that the compact object is
obscured by dust if it is an NS.

The constraints on the accretion rate and pulsar activity from
the bolometric limits were obtained using Equations (3)
and(4). The results are within a factor of 3 to those of the

5.5. Implications for Other Epochs

In the above discussion, we have focused on constraints on
physical properties at the times of observation. Here, we briefly

16

The Astrophysical Journal, 864:174 (24pp), 2018 September 10

explore extrapolations of the limits to other epochs. In the case
of thermal emission from an NS, the surface temperature is
expected to be relatively constant from a year after explosion to
current epochs(Shternin & Yakovlev 2008), which implies
that the current limits apply to earlier times as well. However, if
thermal relaxation has occurred, then it is possible that the
surface temperature has been higher than our current limits.

the current

Accretion and pulsar properties are expected to have
evolved, which implies that
limits need to be
modiﬁed if extrapolated to other epochs. These extrapolations
are uncertain and rely on models of how accretion and pulsar
properties evolve over time. For accretion, the basic picture is a
period of rapid fallback followed by a declining tail with a time
dependence of t 5 3-
. This dependence can be derived from
simple arguments for marginally bound gas(Rees 1988; Evans
& Kochanek 1989; Phinney 1989). This means that the limit at
corresponds to
current epochs of around
3
one year after explosion. The accretion
rate was predicted to be about 10−4 Me yr−1 one year after
explosion(Chevalier 1989; Houck & Chevalier 1991). The
discrepancy with observations was clear a few years after
explosion(e.g., Suntzeff et al. 1992), and is stronger now. A
feedback is indicated, which could be the radiation pressure
when the radiation can ﬁrst escape from the shocked
region(Houck & Chevalier 1991).

where P˙ is the period derivative and M• the NS mass. This
models the NS as a homogeneous sphere, and assumes constant
magnetic ﬁeld and inclination angle. This allows us to translate
the current observational limits to constraints on birth proper-
ties (Figure 8). For all but very high magnetic ﬁeld strengths,
the limits are essentially the same because the spin-down
timescale is long. However, for magnetic ﬁeld strengths above
1016~
G, the current period is practically independent of the
birth period.

For the rotational energy of the NS to contribute a signiﬁcant
fraction of the explosion energy, the rotational period has to be
a few milliseconds. Figure 8 excludes all initial periods shorter
than 10ms unless the magnetic ﬁeld is unusually weak or
unusually strong. If the ﬁeld has not evolved and the pulsar
formula is applicable, the rotation of the NS is thus unlikely to
have contributed a signiﬁcant fraction of the explosion energy,
which lends some support to the hypothesis that SN1987A
was a neutrino-powered event.

surviving binary companion in SN1987A. The evolution

peculiar properties of SN1987A(e.g., Menon & Heger 2017;

In Figure 6 we show a blackbody spectrum corresponding to
the temperature and radius of the Sun scaled by the distance to
SN1987A. It happens to just ﬁt below all UVOIR limits and is
constrained by the SINFONI data point at 1.7 μm. Therefore,
the Sun can serve as the limit for a possible main-sequence
companion in SN1987A. We note that this limit only applies if
our line of sight to a companion is free of dust.

We can use the bolometric limit on the compact object of
138 Le to constrain a main-sequence companion even if our
line of sight is obscured by dust. The mass–luminosity (M–L)

5.7. Remaining Possibilities

In this section, we combine all available information and
explore the remaining possibilities for the compact object,
which results in much stronger conclusions. Even though the
limits in individual frequency intervals are relatively weak,
only a few possible options remain for the compact object in
SN1987A. This is because the direct limits are corrected for
absorption, but do not consider reprocessing of the absorbed
energy. This is a limitation with important consequences
because some of the limits (Table 5) require more than 100 Le
to be absorbed and it is not obvious how such large amounts of
energy can escape undetected. The bolometric limits address
this limitation by including reprocessing of the emission.
However, the bolometric limits only consider the cases when
the UVOIR emission can escape and when the UVOIR
emission is absorbed by dust. This is effectively equivalent to
having a minimal 1D spherical geometry and disregarding the

bolometric limits rely on additional assumptions and are much

Below, we ﬁrst describe in detail the reprocessing of the

thermal emission that
NSs in Section 5.7.1. This is followed by our
favored
explanation and reasons for rejecting additional components in
Section 5.7.2.

5.7.1. Thermal Surface Emission

If the compact object is an NS, then at least thermal surface
emission is expected. For a gravitational mass of 1.4 Me and a

17

The Astrophysical Journal, 864:174 (24pp), 2018 September 10
local radius of 10km, 3.1 MK corresponds to a luminosity at
inﬁnity (redshifted, observer’s frame) of 10 Le (Section 5.3.1).
The choice of 10km is conservative, as a choice of 12km
would increase the luminosity by 60% for a ﬁxed temperature
(increased emitting area and decreased gravitational redshift).
The thermal emission peaks at soft X-ray energies, which is
photoabsorbed locally (on-the-spot) due to the high optical
depth of the ejecta for soft X-rays(Alp et al. 2018). The X-ray
emission that is absorbed by the ejecta is reprocessed into dust
continuum emission, and optical and UV emission lines. The
fact that the very conservative limit of 22 Le (Section 4.5) is
close to the expected luminosity of 10 Le indicates that the
compact object is dust-obscured. Regardless of whether or not
there are dust clumps directly along the line of sight, it is likely
that a signiﬁcant amount of the X-ray input would escape as
thermal dust emission at (sub-)millimeter and FIR wavelengths.
If the reprocessing into dust heating occurs on-the-spot and
thermal dust emission escapes directly, an NS would appear as
a point source in the dust emission. To fully explore this
scenario, we need to analyze observations at frequencies where
the dust emission peaks; investigate the dust lifetime close to
the NS; model the dust composition, geometry, and temper-
ature; model the distribution of 44Ti; and compute the radiation
propagation of UVOIR photons powered by X-ray emission
from an NS. This is beyond the scope of this paper and will be
the subject of future studies.

The most

likely alternative scenario to on-the-spot dust
heating is if the mean free path of UVOIR photons in the ejecta
is comparable to the spatial extent of the ejecta. In this case, the
emission would diffuse on scales comparable to the size of
the ejecta and be spatially mixed with the emission powered by
the decay of 44Ti. This is effectively what was assumed for the
dust-obscured bolometric limit of 138 Le (Section 4.5) because
it did not consider the spatial distribution of the escaping
radiation. However, if the UVOIR photons have a long mean
free path,
the escaping reprocessed UVOIR emission is
expected to be directly observed. This means that only a
certain range of intermediate mean free paths allows an NS to
be hidden in the ejecta.

Future observations that spatially resolve the dust emission
will provide information about the mean free path of UVOIR
photons. It is unlikely that clumps of 44Ti would appear as
point sources if the mean free path is long because observable
overdensities require the clumps of 44Ti to be well-obscured by
dust. In addition, it is not clear if the intrinsic distribution of
44Ti allows for overdensities that can be confused with an NS
(Wongwathanarat et al. 2013, 2015).

A less likely scenario is that the input from the NS surface
emission somehow escapes in the MIR where observational
limits are poor, possibly as hot-dust emission(see Bouchet
et al. 2004; Bouchet & Danziger 2014). This is unlikely
because it requires the primary emission to be reprocessed by
dust with a temperature tuned such that the emission escapes
detection. Furthermore, we know that the MIR ﬁne structure
lines that are predicted to be the primary cooling channels
(Jerkstrand et al. 2011) have not been observed(Lundqvist
et al. 2001; Bouchet et al. 2006), implying that MIR emission
cannot escape the ejecta.

5.7.2. Favored Explanation and Additional Components

All things considered, we ﬁnd the most likely scenario to be
in SN1987A is a dust-obscured

the compact object

thermally emitting NS. We favor this scenario regardless of
whether or not the dust absorbs the UVOIR emission locally or
if the mean free path for UVOIR photons is comparable to the
size of the ejecta.

The bolometric limit of 138 Le leaves little room for
accretion and pulsar wind activity, which would appear as
additional contributions
surface
emission of ∼10 Le (Table 5). The effects vary depending on
the spectrum. For accretion, the input is most likely in the form
of soft X-rays and can be treated analogously to the thermal
surface emission and simply be added to the thermal luminosity
in the current framework.

to the expected thermal

Pulsar wind activity is more complicated since it could
extend over the entire electromagnetic spectrum. However, the
luminosity from millimeter to soft X-rays is limited by the
bolometric limits and the spatial extent(Chevalier & Fransson
1992) is constrained to less than ∼100 km s−1 (Section 4.5).
The only realistic scenario for a PWN to contribute more than
138 Le would be if the spectrum is heavily gamma-ray-
dominated (e.g., Vela and Geminga, Danilenko et al. 2011;
Abdo et al. 2013; Kuiper & Hermsen 2015). High-energy
gamma-rays escape the ejecta and are not expected to be
reprocessed into lower frequencies(Alp et al. 2018). The
Fermi/LAT limit (Table 6) is not stringent enough to rule out
this scenario.

1029~

If the compact object is a radio pulsar, it would emit narrow
erg s−1
beams of radio emission. The total radio power is
for typical radio pulsars(Lorimer & Kramer 2012; Szary et al.
2014). Even if the ejecta are free–free thick at radio wavelengths,
the energy input is insufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly contribute to the
heating of the ejecta. The only realistic avenue to distinguish a
thermally emitting NS from a radio pulsar is if the free–free
depth is low enough and the radio beams sweep our line of sight,
in which case pulsed radio emission would be detected(for
recent limits, see Zhang et al. 2018).

For completeness, the compact object in SN1987A could be
a BH. However, as discussed in Section 1, most studies predict
that an NS formed in the explosion.

5.8. Future Observations

Below, we review the prospects for detecting the compact
object in SN1987A with future facilities. The best constraints
in the radio will come from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA,
Dewdney et al. 2009; Taylor 2013). SKA-low will not be able
to resolve the central ejecta from the ER, but it can perform
timing observations to search for pulsed emission. Because of
the side lobes of ∼1%, the sensitivity of SKA-mid is limited to
∼1% of the ER, which will have 2mJy spots at 0.1arcsec
resolution at 8 GHz(Zanardo et al. 2013). A point limit of
∼0.02mJy can therefore be expected, assuming free–free
absorption to be negligible. The limit could possibly be
improved by an order of magnitude, depending on the
uv-coverage and the ability to self-calibrate.

As discussed in Section 5.7, the thermal surface emission
from an NS could be reprocessed into a point-like source in the
thermal ejecta dust emission. The dust emission peaks at
200 μm (1500 GHz) and has been observed at
low spatial
resolution by ALMA and Herschel (Indebetouw et al. 2014;
Zanardo et al. 2014; Matsuura et al. 2015). Higher-resolution
observations may be able to detect a region of NS-heated dust.
The James Webb Space Telescope(JWST, Gardner et al.
2006), The Giant Magellan Telescope(GMT, Johns et al. 2012),

The Astrophysical Journal, 864:174 (24pp), 2018 September 10
and The European Extremely Large Telescope(E-ELT,
Gilmozzi & Spyromilio 2007) will allow for signiﬁcantly deeper
searches using both imaging and spectral observations in the IR
and optical. However, it remains uncertain if the compact object
in SN1987A is bright at IR or optical wavelengths. A point-like
source of a few Le is expected from reprocessing of thermal
X-ray emission from an NS surface into UVOIR, if not obscured
by dust clouds (Section 5.7).

The Advanced Telescope for High ENergy Astrophysics
(Barcons et al. 2015, 2017; Collon et al. 2015) will be unable to
spatially resolve SN1987A and any emission from the
compact object will be blended with the ER emission. In
addition, Orlando et al.
the X-ray
emission from the ER will fade, but the central parts will
become brighter, primarily driven by interaction with the
reverse shock. This means that SN1987A will become brighter
in X-rays toward the center where the compact object
is
expected to reside. However, these difﬁculties will be partly
counteracted by the decreasing optical depth. The optical depth

2keV is expected to reach 3 by 2066±10(Alp et al. 2018).
The error bar accounts for asymmetries of the explosion, but
excludes any uncertainty in the explosion model, variance
introduced by the compact object being kicked by the
explosion, and CSM structure. At higher energies, this will
occur much earlier, as is relevant for a PWN.

6. Summary and Conclusions

We have placed upper limits on the compact object

in
SN1987A using observations at millimeter wavelengths from
ALMA; NIR from VLT; optical and UV from HST; and X-rays
from Chandra. We assume that the compact object would
appear as a point source in images and that it only contributes
to the continuum component in observed spectra. We also place
constraints on the bolometric luminosity of the compact object
by investigating the total energy budget of SN1987A. Our
main conclusions are as follows:

the geometry of

1. The only model-independent results are the direct flux
limits. They are corrected for absorption, but do not
include information about the reprocessing of the absorbed
emission or
the system. The most
constraining limit in the millimeter range of ALMA is
0.11mJy at 213 GHz. The deepest UVOIR limits are from
the spectra taken by VLT/SINFONI in the NIR and HST/
STIS in the optical. The allowed luminosity of the compact
object in the UVOIR band is approximately 1 Le. The
erg s−1,
X-ray limits allow luminosities less than
but are very sensitive to the assumed spectrum.

2. The total energy budget of SN1987A places a bolometric
limit of 22 Le on the compact object if our line of sight is
free of dust, or 138 Le if dust-obscured. This is based on
assumptions and models of the emission reprocessing, but
relies on a minimal 1D spherical model of the geometry.
3. The limits can be used to constrain the effective local
(unredshifted) blackbody temperature of an NS. Only the
limit of 3.8 MK from the dust-free bolometric limit is
close to constraining any theoretical predictions, which
typically are in the range 3–4 MK. This can be taken as a

Circular Polarimetry of SN1987A

A.1. Observations

555

0l =

All observations were acquired with FORS2 mounted at the
Cassegrain focus of the UT1 VLT. The observations were
obtained in imaging polarimetric mode (IPOL), through the
nm, FWHM=
V_ HIGH FORS2 standard ﬁlter (
123.2nm) and with two different quarter-wave retarder plate
angles of θ=±45° per epoch, during four epochs: 2015
February 15, 16, 18, and 23. We obtain four exposures per
angle, each of 350 s. On the night of February16,
the
instrument was rotated by 90°. In IPOL mode, the image is
split by the Wollaston prism into two orthogonal polarized
outgoing beams, ordinary (o) and extraordinary (e), and the
MOS Slitlets strip mask is inserted to avoid overlapping of the
beams. One of the observations is shown in Figure 9.

A.2. Methods

All

frames are bias-subtracted using the corresponding
calibration bias frames. A flat-ﬁeld correction is not performed
because of the flat-ﬁeld effect(Patat & Romaniello 2006;
O’Brien 2015), the additional polarization caused by the color
dependent offset to the nominal retarder plate position, and
the effect of the incomplete retardation of the quarter-wave
plate(O’Brien 2015) gets canceled out when calculating
the circular polarization using two angles. For each epoch,
we group the science frames according to the quarter-wave
retarder plate angle, split the ordinary and extraordinary beams,
and create separate science frames, align them, and calculate
the median of the four exposures. Finally, we investigate the

20

circular polarization of SN 1987A by performing aperture
photometry with a set of different aperture radii, centered at the
position of SN 1987A (Figure 9) in ordinary and extraordinary
beams using the DAOPHOT.PHOT package, and calculating
the circular polarization from the determined fluxes. We ignore
the observations of February18, because of variable weather
conditions, which makes aperture photometry difﬁcult. We
determine the amount of circular polarization by the equation
below, as described in O’Brien (2015):

where f o and f e are the measured fluxes in the ordinary and

propagating the photometry uncertainties.

A.3. Results

We calculated the circular polarization of SN 1987A
from fluxes determined by performing aperture photometry
using different aperture radii of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5pixels
(250 mas pixel−1), centered at the position of SN 1987A. We
found that the circular polarization is consistent with zero.
Figure 10 shows the circular-polarization, Stokes V values for
the different aperture radii. We are unable to determine an
upper limit on the circular polarization of the central ejecta
because the angular resolution is insufﬁcient for resolving the
structure of SN1987A. This leaves the circular polarization
from the compact object unconstrained.

The Crab was also observed using the same setup but for a
shorter duration. We are unable to detect any circular
polarization in the Crab Nebula, which possibly implies that
the method is relatively insensitive. A possible explanation for
this is that the phase-averaged polarization is essentially zero.

Appendix B

Finding Algorithm

Searches for point sources in the ejecta are made using the
DAOPHOT task daoﬁnd. The most important input parameter
for daoﬁnd is the local noise level (sigma). For ALMA
images, this is set to the off-source noise in the images. We
veriﬁed that
this method gives essentially the same noise
estimates as measurements of
the noise in the visibility
amplitudes. The parameter sigma for the UVOIR images is
chosen to account for both the sky background and the Poisson
noise of the ejecta. We note that both contributions are of
comparable magnitude. The sky background is determined by
setting a 3σ threshold such that essentially no noise peaks pass

Figure 10. Circular polarization of SN 1987A measured using different
aperture radii of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5pixels (250 mas pixel−1). The circular
polarization is consistent with 0%.

while as many real sources as possible are detected. This
transition is clearly seen as a break in the detection-threshold
relation(Davis 1994). The ejecta Poisson noise is set to the
square root of the maximum photon count
in the original
detector pixels within the search region. The parameter sigma
is then computed as the square root of sky background and
ejecta noise is added in quadrature. It is veriﬁed that the sample
deviation of small segments of the central ejecta is comparable
to the computed sigma. The effects of super-resolving when
drizzling and instrument gain on the Poisson noise properties
are accounted for by including a multiplicative correction factor
for the geometric mapping and another factor for the gain.

Limits are determined by inserting artiﬁcial PSFs and ﬁnding
the PSF flux such that it just crosses the 3σ threshold of daoﬁnd.
The procedure is then repeated inside the search region at intervals
of 12.5 mas, which is chosen to be the half-pixel size of the WFC3
and NACO images. At a few points, the detection threshold is
crossed without added artiﬁcial sources,
implying that point
sources are detected. These are all just slightly above the detection
threshold of 3σ and are interpreted as structure in the ejecta. The
limits in these points are set to the maximum flux of a PSF that is
consistent with the observation. None of the threshold crossing
events are spatially coincident in several adjacent ﬁlters and they
are not signiﬁcantly increasing the upper limits.

Appendix C

X-Ray Ejecta Absorption

X-ray absorption by SN ejecta is explored in detail using 3D
neutrino-driven SN explosion models (Wongwathanarat et al.
2013, 2015) in an accompanying paper(Alp et al. 2018). One
of the main conclusions is that the optical depth of the SN
ejecta for X-rays below 10keV is very high at the age of
SN1987A. For a discussion of the transport of the absorbed
energy, see Section 4.5. Here, we use the absorption estimates
based on the B15 explosion model(Woosley et al. 1988) for
our X-ray analysis. The B15 model is a single-star model that
was evolved to core-collapse in one dimension without mass
loss. It explodes as a blue supergiant with a mass of 15.4 Me
and is designed to represent SN1987A.

From the models, we compute the column number densities
(NSN) of H, He, C, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe using the

the asymmetries of the SN explosion. Instead, we focus on
the direction-averaged column number densities and the
hydrogen number densities corresponding to the 10th and
90th percentiles of the optical depth, which are shown in
Table 7. The percentiles are used to represent the variance
introduced by SN explosion asymmetries. Even though the
hydrogen column number density N HSN(
) is relatively low, the
25~
high metallicity of the ejecta results in an optical depth of
at 2keV at current epochs.

Appendix D

Spatial Alignment

All observations need to be accurately registered for us to
use the position determined in Section 3.1, which is needed to
deﬁne the search regions for the images and the extraction
regions for the spectra. Only ALMA has good enough absolute
astrometry. The other observations are aligned with the HST
observations using either nearby stars or the ER, as described
below.

ALMA has an absolute astrometric accuracy of less than
∼10 mas. The accuracy is determined by measuring the phase
rms and using it to estimate the phase transfer error, which
likely results in a quite conservative estimate. Applying a self-
calibration gain table to a point source and measuring the
offset, and considering the accuracy in measuring baselines
both yield uncertainty estimates that are smaller than 10 mas.
Both NACO images are mapped onto the HST/WFC3
images using the IRAF tasks geomap and geotran. We
choose 10 bright stars in the common FOV, using polynomial
ﬁtting functions, and a general geometry, which consists of
shifts, scale factors, a rotation, and a skew. This aligns the
images and resizes them to a common pixel size of 252 mas2.
The magniﬁcation increases the pixel size from the original
detector scale of 13.272 mas2, but

measurements because the FWHM of the point-spread function
(PSF) is
mas. Comparisons of NACO and HST images
25~ mas at the
show that the spatial alignments are better than
position of SN1987A, and the rotations and skews have a
negligible impact on the region relevant to this work.

The SINFONI images are aligned by ﬁtting an elliptical band
with a Gaussian radial proﬁle to the ER. The center of the
ellipse is then matched with the HST image position presented
in Section 3.1. The accuracy is better than 20 mas, which is
estimated using the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix.
Alignment using nearby stars is not possible because the small
FOV of SINFONI does not extend much beyond the ER. The
hotspots are also poorly resolved and faint in the SINFONI
images, which is why an elliptical band is used to ﬁt the ER as
an extended source.

The position of SN1987A in the STIS observation is
determined by mapping onto the HST images. The R.A. is
determined with respect to a nearby, isolated reference star that
was used for the spacecraft pointing when performing the ﬁve
individual slit observations. Spectral lines from the ER are used
to match the decl. with the HST images. This is done by ﬁtting
Gaussians to the north and south 1D proﬁles of the ER in
the slits. The position of SN1987A is known relative to the
ER from Section 3.1. The ﬁve slits are ﬁrst matched
individually, allowing the sample variance to serve as an
estimate of the statistical uncertainty. The average position of
the ﬁve alignments is then used to align all slits. The 1σ
uncertainty in the ﬁnal decl. of all slits is 0.14 pixels or 7.0 mas.
The ER in the Chandra observation is modeled by ﬁtting an
ellipse of sinusoidal intensity along the azimuth and Gaussian
radial proﬁle (Section 3.6.1), which is also used for alignment.
There are no point sources visible in the Chandra FOV that
can be used for alignment. The error in position using this
method is ∼40 mas, which is small compared to the PSF
FWHM of ∼700 mas of Chandra/ACIS. The uncertainty of
the position is determined by simulating samples from the
model and then applying the same ﬁtting method to resample
the position.

Observations Used for Astrometric Registration of

Appendix E

SN1987A

The observations that are used to determine the position of
SN1987A are listed in Table 8. The WFC3 observations are
reduced as described in Section 2.4. The previous observations
are described in Larsson et al. (2011).

Appendix F
Chandra PSF

The Chandra PSF is created using MARX 5.3.2(Davis et al.
2012), which is called from the CIAO task simulate_psf.
The PSF is created for the position of SN1987A on the CCD
chip, 22 pixels off-axis (approximately the distance between the
default aimpoint and optical axis), using an input spectrum
extracted from the source region. The quantum efﬁciency of the
detector is included by disabling the ideal option. Simulation
of the readout streak and pileup are both performed. The
extended option is disabled because the PSF is used as a
convolution kernel. The PSF is simulated onto a pixel size of
502 mas2 and statistical fluctuations of
the simulation are
reduced by making 200 iterations. The default value of 70 mas
for
the parameter AspectBlur, which is the measured
uncertainty of the aspect solution, is used because it better
matches the observation according to the statistical likelihood.
We note that this is smaller than the “merely suggested” value of
∼280 mas,32 which is based on a limited number of observa-
tions(Primini et al. 2011). The source of this additional blurring
for at least some observations is currently not fully understood.
