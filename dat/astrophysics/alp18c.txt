Abstract

The material expelled by core-collapse supernova (SN) explosions absorbs X-rays from the central regions. We use
SN models based on three-dimensional neutrino-driven explosions to estimate optical depths to the center of the
explosion, compare different progenitor models, and investigate the effects of explosion asymmetries. The optical
depths below 2keV for progenitors with a remaining hydrogen envelope are expected to be high during the ﬁrst
−2 E−2, where t4 is the time since
century after the explosion due to photoabsorption. A typical optical depth is 100 t4
the explosion in units of 10,000 days (∼27 years) and E is the energy in units of keV. Compton scattering
dominates above 50keV, but the scattering depth is lower and reaches unity at ∼1000 days at 1MeV. The optical
depths are approximately an order of magnitude lower for hydrogen-stripped progenitors. The metallicity of the SN
ejecta is much higher than that in the interstellar medium, which enhances photoabsorption and makes absorption
edges stronger. These results are applicable to young SN remnants in general, but we explore the effects on
observations of SN1987A and the compact object in CasA in detail. For SN1987A, the absorption is high and
the X-ray upper limits of ∼100L☉ on a compact object are approximately an order of magnitude less constraining
than previous estimates using other absorption models. The details are presented in an accompanying paper. For
the central compact object in CasA, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant effects of our more detailed absorption model on the
inferred surface temperature.

1. Introduction

Core-collapse supernova (SN, core-collapse unless otherwise
stated) explosions expel large amounts of material into their
surroundings. The ejecta dominate the absorption for X-rays up
to the young SN remnant (SNR) stage. To accurately analyze
X-ray observations, it is important to estimate the optical depth
as a function of energy along the line of sight. Most X-ray
absorption models(e.g., Wilms et al. 2000; Gatuzz et al. 2015)
have been developed in order to account for photoabsorption
by the interstellar medium (ISM) and the column densities are
often obtained by retrieving the hydrogen column number
density NISM(H) from H I surveys(Dickey & Lockman 1990;
Kalberla et al. 2005; Winkel et al. 2016; HI4PI Collaboration
et al. 2016). We use the notation NISM(H) instead of the
standard NH to differentiate NISM(H) from NSN(H), which is the
hydrogen column number density of the ejecta. Other methods
include letting NISM(H) be a free parameter that is ﬁtted or
) from observations of dust or molecular lines.
inferring N
It is very common to assume that the abundances of all other
elements, relative to hydrogen, are solar or representative
ISM abundances(e.g., Anders & Grevesse 1989; Grevesse &
Sauval 1998; Wilms et al. 2000). The main difference in young
SNRs is that
in
the ISM.

the metallicity is much higher than that

Here, we use three-dimensional (3D) neutrino-driven SN
explosion models to estimate the column densities of all
elements that have a signiﬁcant contribution to the optical
depth. Similar estimates have been made by other studies using
individual progenitors and less realistic SN models (Fransson &
Chevalier 1987; Seraﬁmovich et al. 2004; Orlando et al. 2015;
Esposito et al. 2018). Our results are generally in agreement with
previous works, but we explore 3D SN explosion models,

HISM(

quantify the uncertainties introduced by SN asymmetries, and
compare different progenitors. The need for more general and
detailed ejecta absorption models has been indicated in the
literature (e.g., Stage et al. 2004; Shtykovskiy et al. 2005; Long
et al. 2012; Posselt et al. 2013; Orlando et al. 2015). We focus on
the absorption toward the center of the SN, where the compact
object
is expected to reside, and also re-analyze X-ray
observations of the compact objects in SN1987A and CasA
using our absorption model.

SN1987A is the closest observed SN in more than three
centuries (for reviews of SN 1987A, see Arnett et al. 1989;
McCray 1993; McCray & Fransson 2016). It is located in the
Large Magellanic Cloud at a distance of approximately
50kpc(Panagia et al. 1991; Panagia 1999). SN1987A was a
TypeII-pec core-collapse SN and is therefore expected to leave
a compact object. The observed neutrino burst conﬁrms the
existence of a compact object (Bionta et al. 1987; Hirata et al.
1987, 1988; Bratton et al. 1988), but electromagnetic radiation
from the compact object has never been observed despite more
than 30 years of searches spanning the entire observable
spectrum. The X-ray absorption below a few keV in SN1987A
is very high at current epochs, which limits our ability to probe
the central parts of
these energies. An
accompanying paper(Alp et al. 2018) uses estimates from
the current work to model the X-ray absorption and presents a
detailed study of multiwavelength flux limits on the compact
object. The main result of the X-ray analysis is that the limits
are about 100L☉, depending on the assumed spectrum of the
compact object. This is approximately an order of magnitude
less constraining than previously published X-ray limits. The
difference, compared to previous absorption models,
is a
substantial increase of the column densities, particularly for the

energy range.

CasA is a SNR at a distance of 3.4 0.1
0.3

kpc, based on proper
motion and age data(Reed et al. 1995). CasA was created by a
TypeIIb core-collapse SN(Krause et al. 2008; Rest et al.
2011). Extrapolation of the proper motion of the expanding
ejecta estimates the explosion date of the SN to be around the
year 1670(Fesen et al. 2006). The SN was possibly observed by
John Flamsteed on 1680 August 16(Flamsteed 1725; Ashworth
1980; Hughes 1980; Kamper 1980). The central compact object
(CCO) created by the SN was detected in the ﬁrst light images of
Chandra (Tananbaum 1999; Pavlov et al. 2000; Chakrabarty
et al. 2001). The spectrum of the CCO has been interpreted as
thermal emission from a neutron star (NS) surface with a carbon
atmosphere(Ho & Heinke 2009). Fast cooling of the CCO has
been reported based on analyses of Chandra X-ray observation-
s(Heinke & Ho 2010; Elshamouty et al. 2013), but
the
signiﬁcance of the cooling has been discussed by Posselt et al.
(2013). Here, we simply repeat part of their analyses and explore
the difference introduced by using a more realistic absorption
model based on our 3D SN explosion models.

This paper is organized as follows. We introduce the 3D SN
explosion models in Section 2 and describe the methods in
Section 3. The estimated optical depths and abundances are
presented in Section 4 and the implications and uncertainties of
the results are discussed in Section 5. We provide a summary
and the main conclusions in Section 6. An investigation of the
effects of ejecta absorption on the interpretation of the observed
CasA CCO spectrum is provided in Appendix A.

2. Models

SN explosion models(Wongwathanarat et al. 2015, and
references therein) are used in order to estimate the X-ray
absorption in SNRs. Details regarding the models are listed in
Table 1 and ejecta compositions are listed in Table 2. We
(BSG) models
choose the B15 and N20 blue supergiant
because they are designed to match the progenitor properties of
SN1987A. Observations of SN1987A show that the progeni-
tor was a BSG(Kirshner et al. 1987; Walborn et al. 1987; West
et al. 1987; White & Malin 1987). The B15 model is used for
the analysis of the X-ray limits on the SN1987A compact
object(Alp et al. 2018) because it is the single-star progenitor
that yields the best agreement of light-curve calculations based

on self-consistent 3D explosion models, compared to observa-
tions of SN1987A(Utrobin et al. 2015; V. P. Utrobin 2018, in
preparation).

The L15 and W15 models are included in the analysis for the
purpose of extending the results to a case considering an
explosion of a red supergiant (RSG), and comparing these
results to the BSG cases, which should be of interest for the
X-ray analyses of more distant SNe. Finally, the IIb model is an
explosion of a bare helium core of a RSG. The model shows
similarities between the ejecta asymmetries and those deduced
from observations of CasA(Wongwathanarat et al. 2017), and
thus is used for our CasA CCO analysis. We will refer to B15,
N20, L15, and W15 as the non-stripped models.

2.1. Progenitors

All progenitor models are based on one-dimensional (1D)
evolution of non-rotating single stars. The B15 model represents
SN 1987A and was evolved without mass loss by Woosley et al.
(1988). The N20 model was artiﬁcially constructed by combining
the core(Nomoto & Hashimoto 1988) and envelope(Saio et al.
1988) of two different stars. The combination was made by
Shigeyama & Nomoto (1990) and designed to match the
properties of the progenitor of SN 1987A. The L15 model was
computed without mass loss by Limongi et al. (2000) and the
W15 model is the s15s7b2 model of Woosley & Weaver (1995).
The IIb model is created by removing all but 0.5M☉ of the
hydrogen envelope of the W15 model to avoid the dynamical
consequences of the hydrogen shell and to allow the star to
explode as a TypeIIb SN, which was the type of the CasA
SN(Krause et al. 2008; Rest et al. 2011).

2.2. Early Evolution

The short time between the start of core-collapse to ∼10 ms
after bounce was treated by dedicated simulations. The B15
model was collapsed using a Lagrangian hydro-code by Bruenn
(1993) and the N20, L15, and W15 models were collapsed
using the PROMETHEUS-VERTEX code(Rampp & Janka 2002)
in one dimension(Wongwathanarat et al. 2013).

The simulations then were continued (Wongwathanarat et al.
2010b, 2013) from ∼10ms after core bounce, past the shock
revival at ∼250 ms, and extended to about 1s after shock revival
in three dimensions. These 3D simulations were performed using
the PROMETHEUS code(Fryxell et al. 1991; Müller et al. 1991)
with suitable tuned neutrino heating at the inner boundary. When
mapping from 1D to 3D, perturbations with an amplitude of 0.1 %
were introduced by hand(Wongwathanarat et al. 2013). The 3D
simulations were run on axis-free Yin–Yang grids(Kageyama &
Sato 2004; Wongwathanarat et al. 2010a) with an angular
resolution of 2°. Because of computational
the
innermost regions corresponding to radial velocities of less
than ∼10kms−1 were removed from the simulation (Scheck
et al. 2006; Wongwathanarat et al. 2013).

limitations,

2.3. Intermediate Evolution

We let intermediate times refer to the time between the end
of early stages at ∼1 s and the beginning of late times at ∼105 s
(∼1 day), which was followed by Wongwathanarat et al.
(2015). The ﬁve models were mapped onto a larger Yin–Yang
grid with the same angular resolution of 2° and a relative radial
resolution higher than 1% at all radii. The inner boundary was
initially set to 500km and was continuously moved outward to

relax time step constraints imposed by the material at small
radii with high sound speed. The outer boundary was moved so
that the ejecta remain within the grid and was set to 109km by
the end of the simulations.

2.4. Late Evolution

Shortly before the shocks break out from the progenitors
(t  104 s), we continue the 3D simulations with a new version
of the PROMETHEUS-HOTB code that includes a description of
β-decay. The grid remains unchanged compared to the
intermediate evolution. However, in this part of the simulation,
we employ a radially outward moving grid, which reduces the
numerical diffusion between neighboring grid cells due to the
lower relative velocities of the radially expanding ejecta. We
continue the simulations until ∼150 days for the non-stripped
models and ∼18 days for the IIb model. At later times, we do
not expect signiﬁcant effects of the β-decay on the structures,
because the ejecta become transparent
to the released
γ-radiation and because most of the radioactive material has
already decayed(for details, see M. Gabler et al. 2018, in
preparation).

2.5. Asymmetries

All models possess strong asymmetries that are created as a
result of non-radial hydrodynamic instabilities behind the
stalled shock, where neutrinos deposit
the energy of the
supernova explosion during the ﬁrst seconds after core
bounce(Wongwathanarat et al. 2015). This innermost region
is dominated by iron-peak elements and form fast-rising
plumes, which are initially rather similar for all models. In
the carbon–oxygen layer,
the plumes are not extremely
decelerated in all models except for the N20 case, which
results in considerably more compressed structures in the N20
model. More pronounced differences between the models
develop at the interface between the carbon–oxygen core and
the helium layer, where Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities after the
passage of the shock change the morphology of the expanding
ejecta. Considerable evolution of the morphology also occurs
after the shock has decelerated in the hydrogen envelope. A
strong reverse shock is launched upstream into the expanding
inner ejecta, which decelerates and compresses the ejecta. The
IIb model evolves very similarly to the W15 model, except no
reverse shock is formed at the helium–hydrogen interface. This

3

results in stronger and larger-scale asymmetries, higher overall
ejecta velocities, and a sharper inner radius of the ejecta
(because of the absence of an extended low-velocity tail of the
radial distribution) in the IIb model. During the time covered
until the ﬁnal stage of our simulations, the β-decay inflates the
radioactive iron-peak ﬁngers signiﬁcantly. A comparison of the
asymmetries at 2s and tlate between all considered models is
provided in Figure 1. The plots also visualize the outcome of
different mixing and fragmentation histories of the initial
structures as a consequence of differences in the evolutionary
phases mentioned before.

Additionally, it has been shown that different asymmetries
develop even if the initial conditions are nearly identical for the
same progenitor because of the chaotic nature of hydrodynamic
instabilities(Wongwathanarat et al. 2015). Müller et al. (2017)
demonstrated by 3D simulations that pre-collapse large-scale
convective perturbations in the oxygen shell during the late
stages of stellar evolution can have a supportive influence on
the onset of
the explosion. These seed perturbations are
important because they help the development of violent
hydrodynamic mass motions behind the supernova shock,
which facilitate the outward expansion of the supernova shock
and of the neutrino-heated matter in its wake. More details on
the evolution of asymmetries can be found in Section5 of
Wongwathanarat et al. (2015) for the early to intermediate
phases, in M.Gabler et al.(2018, in preparation) for the late
phases of the non-stripped models, and in Section3.3 of
Wongwathanarat et al. (2017) for late stages of the IIb model,
which exempliﬁes the consequences of removing the hydrogen
envelope from the W15 model.

2.6. Nucleosynthesis

from 4He to 56Ni;

There were minor differences in the treatment of

the
nucleosynthesis in the different models. Starting from after
core bounce at ∼10 ms, the nucleosynthesis in the BSG models
was followed by a network of elements that includes protons;
the 13 α-nuclei
radioactive daughter
products; and a tracer nucleus X (Kifonidis et al. 2003;
Wongwathanarat et al. 2013, 2015). The tracer comprises
neutron-rich, iron-group elements and was produced in grid
cells where the electron fraction was below 0.49. The
radioactive products that were included were 44Ca and 44Sc
from b+ decay of 44Ti, and 56Fe and 56Co from b+ decay of
56Ni. The RSG and IIb models follow fewer nuclear species,

omitting 32S, 36Ar, 48Cr, and 52Fe in the burning network. Free
neutrons are followed in all simulations but are irrelevant to our
study of photoabsorption and Compton scattering.

3. Methods

The models consist of 3D maps of number densities of each
element, deﬁned from an inner radius to an outer radius. The
vast majority of the mass of the SN ejecta is inside the spherical
shell deﬁned by the simulation grid. We refer to this mass as

the ejecta mass Mej. The outer radius is set such that essentially
all of the ejecta are contained within the grid. The dynamics of
the material inside of the inner boundary are not followed in the
3D explosion simulations. This material includes the NS with a
baryonic mass MNS and its surrounding material. The mass that
is excluded from the simulation within the inner radius has
velocities below escape velocity at the end of our simulations
and is likely to fall back to the NS on a longer timescale. It is
therefore added to the mass of the compact remnant. Typical

masses are 0.01M☉ for the non-stripped models and less than
0.15M☉ for the IIb model. We veriﬁed that any realistic
contribution from the mass inside the inner cutoff has a
negligible impact on the results even if the material escaped.
The data are mapped from the Yin–Yang grids used for the
3D explosion simulations to spherical coordinate systems for
the current work. We denote the conventional radial coordinate
r but deﬁne f as the longitude ranging from 0 to 2π and q as the
is
latitude ranging from
better than 1% at all radii except within radii corresponding to
kms−1, where the resolution is better than
velocities v

spherical grids resolve the models well enough for accurate
estimates of the optical depth while not over-resolving the Yin–
Yang grids used for the 3D explosion simulations.

),
We denote a unit vector starting from the origin n
which will henceforth be referred to as “direction.” Contributions
from different directions are weighted by cos q throughout the
analysis to compensate for the varying angular resolution of the
spherical coordinate system. The expansions of all models are
assumed to be homologous after tlate and all presented values are
scaled to 10,000days (∼27 years). The column number density as
nNSN(ˆ) is computed by integrating the
a function of direction
column number density along all directions of the model speciﬁed
by the angular coordinates f and θ. The integration is carried out

where E is the photon energy, the summation index i represents
all chemical elements, SNs is the photoabsorption cross section,
and Cs is the Compton scattering cross section. The photo-
absorption cross sections below 10keV are taken from the
tables of Gatuzz et al. (2015).4 They compile cross sections
obtained using different analytic methods(Bethe & Salpeter
1957), the R-matrix method (Gorczyca 2000; García et al.
2005, 2009; Juett et al. 2006; Witthoeft et al. 2009, 2011;
Gorczyca et al. 2013; Hasoğlu et al. 2014), semi-empirical
ﬁts(Verner & Yakovlev 1995), and experimental values
(Kortright & Kim 2000). The tables cover energies from 0.01
to 10keV with 650,000 logarithmically spaced steps, which
results in a relative energy resolution of 10−5. Photoabsorption
cross sections from 10 to 100keV are computed using the
analytic ﬁts of Verner & Yakovlev (1995). The Compton
scattering cross section at energies higher than ∼10keV, which
is the binding energy of the K-shell electrons, is given by the
Klein-Nishina formula(e.g., Rybicki & Lightman 1979).

We reduce the number of free parameters by making a
number of simpliﬁcations. We assume that the formation of
molecules and dust has a negligible impact on the X-ray
absorption properties (see Section 5.3). It is also assumed that
all atoms are in the neutral ground state. Cross sections for
single and double ionization are included in Table 2 of Gatuzz
et al. (2015) and general cases can be explored using the
analytic ﬁts of Verner & Yakovlev (1995) and Verner et al.
(1996). Detailed models of SN1987A show that the ejecta
indeed are mainly in neutral and at most in singly ionized states

et al. 2015).

(low ionization ions such as Mg II, Si II, Ca II, and Fe II,
Jerkstrand et al. 2011). This is also expected for young SNe in
general. For remnants like Cas A,
the situation is more
complicated. The effect of ionization above 0.3keV is small in
most cases, but quantitative estimates would require detailed
knowledge of the ionization state of the gas.

Another simpliﬁcation is that we group some of the elements
traced by the nucleosynthesis network. This is done because of
radioactive decay and because we aim to provide column
densities of elements that are abundant and included in publicly
available ISM models. We combine the number densities of
40Ca, 44Ca, 44Sc, 44Ti, and 48Cr and treat the combined number
density as 40Ca. The elements 44Ti, 44Sc, and 44Ca form a
radioactive decay chain with 44Ca as the stable product. The
difference between isotopes of the same element is negligible
because the cross sections are determined by the electrons. For
reference, the number of neutrons of an atom is not a parameter
in the analytic ﬁts of the photoabsorption cross sections(Ver-

4. Results

A complete absorption description requires knowledge of the
column densities of all elements for all directions. We do not
intend to provide a description at this level of detail. Instead,
we focus on direction-averaged column number densities and
optical depths in Section 4.1, with the purpose of providing
representative values for quantities of interest. The optical
depth variations along different directions are explored in
Section 4.2. This represents the level of variance of the optical
depth within a speciﬁc SNR. We superﬁcially investigate the
differences introduced by different compositions along differ-
ent lines of sight in Section 4.3. Results concerning Compton
scattering are contained in Section 4.4. A comparison of SN

are in the neutral ground state and that
the formation of
molecules and dust has a negligible impact on the relevant
absorption properties (Section 3).

All presented results are at a time of 10,000 days unless
otherwise stated. However, the column densities and optical
depths can be scaled to other epochs as ∝t−2, where t is the
time since the SN explosion, if the ejecta are assumed to
expand homologously. The models are evolved up to the point
when the ejecta start expanding homologously, implying that

Homologous expansion is a reasonable approximation until

over more than an order of magnitude because the dynamics
are sensitive to explosion energy, ejecta mass, and density
distribution of the ejecta and circumstellar medium along the
line of sight. For SN1987A, the inner ejecta along our line of

the reverse shock

2004). In general, theoretical models predict that the inner
ejecta expand freely for up to a few thousand years for simple
models of core-collapse SNe(e.g., Truelove & McKee 1999).
However, in extreme cases, such as for TypeIIn SNe and for
lines of sight crossing the dense inner ring of SN1987A
(Fransson et al. 2013), the timescales can be much shorter.

Direction-averaged optical depths for all models and the
individual contributions for the B15 model at 10,000 days are
shown in Figure 2. The optical depths are high and the ejecta
are opaque for soft X-rays for several decades after the
explosion. A typical optical depth for the non-stripped models
is 30 at 2keV.

The optical depth for the IIb model is approximately an order
of magnitude lower because the expansion velocity is higher,
which is a consequence of having removed all but 0.5M☉ of the
hydrogen envelope. The decrease in optical depth because of the
removed hydrogen is subdominant because the contribution
from hydrogen is small even in the non-stripped models.

The general behavior is that He, C, O, Si, Ca, and Fe are all
dominating in different models within certain energy ranges.
The differences are determined by the relative abundances of
the metals. However, the relative abundances of the metals are
uncertain because of
the
simulations (Section 5.3.1).

the sums. The blue B15 line is partially covered by the green L15 line in the photoabsorption regime and the red W15 line in the scattering regime. The non-stripped
models are very similar to each other and signiﬁcantly different from the IIb model, which expels the ejecta at higher velocities because all but 0.5M☉ of the hydrogen

Figure 3. (Left) Cumulative direction-averaged optical depth at 10,000 days at 2keV as a function of velocity for all models. The optical depth of the IIb model has
been scaled by a factor of 20 for visual clarity. The effect of the cutoff at 2400kms−1 for the IIb model is expected to be small (Section 3). The density gradient at the
inner boundary of the IIb model is very steep because of a much weaker reverse shock, which is a consequence of the lack of a hydrogen envelope. (Right)
Contribution to the cumulative 2keV optical depth per log(velocity) for the B15 model. Mathematically, this is d τ(2 keV)/d log (v), where v is the velocity. The
Compton scattering (CS) contribution and sum have been scaled for visual clarity. The bump at ∼2500kms−1 in the scattering contribution is from hydrogen. The
distribution is qualitatively similar for the other models.

The cumulative direction-averaged optical depth at 2keV as
a function of velocity is shown in Figure 3 (left) for all models.
The dominant contribution to the optical depth is from ejecta
with velocities in the range 400–2000kms−1 for the non-
stripped models. The velocity range is shifted to higher
velocities by a factor of ∼3 for the IIb model because of the
higher average ejecta velocity. We also analyze the contribu-
tions to the cumulative distribution from individual elements
(Figure 3, right) and ﬁnd that the general trend is that the
contributions from all metals are from approximately the same
velocities. There is a trend that contributions from heavier
elements are on average from velocities lower than those of
lighter elements. The effect of this is less than a factor of a few
in velocity, which is comparable to the spread in velocities for
individual elements.

4.2. Asymmetries of the Ejecta

SN explosions are highly asymmetric and a consequence is
that the absorption depends on the line of sight (Section 2.5).
The projections of the optical depths for all directions of the
B15 and IIb models are shown in Figure 4. All models show
pronounced asymmetric clumpy structures or ﬁlaments. The
variances in optical depths are caused by a combination of
varying amounts of ejecta expelled in different directions and
varying compositions of the ejecta.

We also visually inspected projections of column number
individual elements (not shown). The most
densities of
uniformly distributed elements are the light elements H, He,
and C, whereas the heavy elements Ca and Fe are the most
asymmetrically distributed. To a certain extent, the directions
of high abundances of heavy elements are anti-correlated with

2keV of the B15 (top) and IIb (bottom) models at 10,000 days. The projection
looks qualitatively similar at different energies for each of the models. The
relative strength of the different structures that can be seen varies across
absorption edges because of different compositions.

The non-stripped models are very similar, while the IIb model has lower optical
depths. The iron-peak elements in the IIb model are also more asymmetrically
distributed. This is clearly seen from the very wide CDF at 8keV.

light elements. We interpret this as rising clumps of heavy
elements that pierce through the outer shells of the progenitor
and leave holes or push the light elements into ﬁlaments. It is
often the case that the clumps consist of heavier elements,
whereas the smoother variations and ﬁlaments are lighter
elements from the outer layers of the progenitor.

Another

representation of asymmetries is the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of the optical depth. In the CDFs,
the asymmetries are correlated to the width of the distribution.
The optical depth CDFs at 0.5, 8, and 100keV are shown in
Figure 5. The qualitative and quantitative behaviors of the non-
stripped models are similar. The optical depths of the IIb model
are clearly lower, but the distribution of optical depths is also
wider. The most notable feature of the CDFs’ over all directions is
the very wide distribution at 8keV for the IIb model, which is the
result of the highly asymmetric distribution of iron-peak elements.
More quantitative measurements of the asymmetries are
given by the variations in optical depths at given energies for
each model, which are provided in Table 4. The conﬁdence
intervals represent the 1-σ intervals of the optical depth as a
function of direction, which are at a level of approximately
20%–40%. We also include the ratio of the upper bound to the
lower bound as a relative measure of asymmetry variance. The
optical depth for a given model and energy typically spans a
factor of 1.5–2. It is also clear from the variance measures that
the IIb model is more asymmetric, in particular around 8keV
where the iron-peak elements dominate the opacity.

4.3. Ejecta Compositions

The results up to this point have focused on the direction-
averaged optical depth and variance of the optical depth
introduced by both asymmetric distribution of material and
composition. It is possible to isolate the contribution to the
variance of varying composition, which affects the energy
dependence of the optical depth. We do not attempt to quantify
the distribution of abundances of all
individual elements.
Instead, we deﬁne the effective slope α by

trend is that

where σSN,eff is the effective cross section of the SN ejecta. The
general
lighter elements have steeper energy
dependencies and heavier elements have shallower dependen-
cies. Therefore, the effective slope can serve as a representation
of the variations in compositions as a function of direction. The
advantage of introducing α in place of the composition is that
the composition depends on 11 parameters (all elements).
The drawback is that it provides no insight into the relative
abundances of heavier elements, which determine the relative
strength of absorption edges. We choose to measure α as
the slope between 0.3 and 10keV.

Figure 6 shows the distribution of α for all directions. The
non-stripped models are similar and have distributions that
overlap almost completely, whereas the IIb model shows a
wider distribution of a. This is a consequence of

asymmetric distribution of iron-peak elements in the IIb model.
For all models, there is a signiﬁcant spread in the distribution,
which indicates that the composition is varying. It is worth
pointing out that even though the slope is deﬁned over the
range 0.3–10keV, absorption is often only important
in a
limited interval where the optical depth is around unity. This is
because any lower opacity leaves the spectrum relatively
unaffected, whereas higher depths are likely to completely
obscure the source.

4.4. Compton Scattering

In contrast

to photoabsorption, Compton scattering will
not destroy the photon, but will result in a down-scattering
of the photon energy, until photoabsorption dominates. This
was discussed for the early radioactive phase in SN1987A
dominated by 56Ni and 57Ni decay, as well as for pulsar input
(e.g., Ebisuzaki & Shibazaki 1988; Grebenev & Syunyaev
1988; Xu et al. 1988, and references therein). Here, we limit
ourselves to estimates of the optical depths and do not further
discuss the spectrum resulting from the scattering.

10 4

Figure 2 shows the contribution of Compton scattering to the
the scattering depth above
optical depth. At 10,000 days,
50keV is 1–3×10−2 for
the non-stripped models and
~ ´ - for the IIb model. The dominating contribution to
the scattering depth is by hydrogen and helium. The relative
contributions can be seen from the electron column number
densities provided in Table 3. Assuming homologous expan-
sion, the scattering depth at 1MeV is unity at ∼1000 days for
the non-stripped models and ∼150 days for the IIb model.

The total optical depths above 50keV are dominated by
Compton scattering. The spread in scattering depths can be seen in
Figure 5 and Table 4. The RSGs have lower asymmetry variances
in the scattering regime. The main reason for this is that scattering
is dominated by lighter elements, which are more uniformly
distributed in the more extended envelopes of the RSGs.

5. Discussion

5.1. Absorption Properties

The absorption to the central regions of SNRs is high for
X-rays for a long time after the explosion. If the ejecta expand
homologously, the optical depth below 2keV remains above
unity for more than a century for the non-stripped models
and reaches unity at 10keV at approximately 30 years. The
situation is very different
the IIb model. Because
the hydrogen envelope is stripped off, the SN explosion expels
the ejecta at a factor of three higher velocities, which results in
a factor of nine lower optical depths. The contribution of

Different compositions result in different effective cross sections. Thus, the
effective slope serves as a proxy for the composition.

hydrogen to the optical depth constitutes less than ∼10% of the
total photoabsorption depth above 0.3keV for all models
(Figure 2). The expansion velocity v is also connected to the
SN explosion energy E as v
, where M is the total
ejecta mass. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that higher
explosion energies or lower ejecta masses lead to higher
expansion velocities and lower optical depths.

µ

Another important property of ejecta absorption is that the
metallicity is much higher than standard ISM abundances. This
implies that the hydrogen column density commonly used by
X-ray astronomers is a poor parameterization of the absorption.
The effective cross section is much higher for high-metallicity
gas than for standard ISM compositions. The energy depend-
ence of the effective cross section is signiﬁcantly flatter for
metal-rich than metal-poor gas, primarily because high-
metallicity gas has more pronounced absorption edges, mostly
K-shell edges, in the 0.3–10keV energy range. The stronger
absorption edges are likely to be the most robust observational
signature of high-metallicity absorption, because the difference
in continuum absorption is likely degenerate with underlying
model components.

Compton scattering dominates the optical depth above
50keV and the energy dependence of the scattering depth is
weak for energies lower than 100keV. The transition energy of
50keV is higher than the typical value for ISM compositions,
where the transition occurs at ∼10keV. The reason for this is

the higher metallicity of the SN ejecta, which signiﬁcantly
increases the importance of photoabsorption and has a much
smaller effect on the scattering properties.

5.2. Comparison with Previous Estimates

In general, previous studies found SN ejecta absorption
properties comparable to our estimates. However, no previous
work has explored 3D SN explosion models, quantiﬁed the
uncertainties introduced by SN asymmetries, or compared
different progenitors.

Fransson & Chevalier (1987) modeled the absorption for
X-rays in SN1987A using the 15 M☉ 1D model 4A from
Woosley et al. (1988). They showed the photoabsorption
optical depth in their Figure 1 and found that the optical depth
reaches unity at 10keV at 18years. This can be compared to
our estimates for BSGs, which show that the optical depth at
10keV reaches unity at ∼30 years. However, they noted that
using the 25 M☉ model 8A(Woosley et al. 1988) resulted in
optical depths that are a factor of 2.2 higher, which better
agrees with our results. Fransson & Chevalier (1987) also
concluded that Compton scattering starts dominating over
photoabsorption in the 30–100keV range, depending on the
composition of the gas.

Seraﬁmovich et al. (2004) used the 15 M☉ 1D model 14E1 of
Blinnikov et al. (2000) to estimate the ejecta absorption in the
1000 year-old pulsar PSR B0540−69.3 in the Large Magella-
nic Cloud. They reported that the effective cross section for SN
ejecta is 40 times higher than the standard value for ISM
abundances (see Appendix B) and that the effect of ejecta
absorption is negligible because of the age of PSR B0540
−69.3, which agrees with our results.

Orlando et al. (2015) performed simulations describing
SN1987A and found an ejecta hydrogen column density of
∼3×1022 cm−2 at 30 years. This number is close to our
values of the hydrogen column number densities (Table 3).
However, they did not report the chemical composition of the
ejecta, which is critical for a complete absorption estimate.

Esposito et al. (2018) used the model lm18a7Ad of Dessart
& Hillier (2010, provided to them by S. E. Woosley). It is a 1D
model with a total ejecta mass of 15.6M☉. Esposito et al.
(2018) used the abundances
from the model, assumed
homogeneous distribution, and estimated the density based
on approximations. They reported a hydrogen column density
of 7.6×1021 cm−2 for the ejecta, which should result
in
absorption properties comparable to our estimates for the
abundances provided in their Table 2.

5.3. Sources of Uncertainty

There are several sources of uncertainty that we have
neglected. The presented uncertainties on the optical depths in
Table 4 only represent
the variance introduced by the
asymmetries for a given model. One of the purposes of
providing column densities for comparable models is to get a
handle on the uncertainties associated with the progenitor
properties, stellar evolution, and explosion simulations. The
sensitivity of
the results to progenitor models and early
explosion simulations can be estimated by comparing the four
non-stripped models. They were not tuned to represent the
same progenitor, only B15 and N20 were designed to match the
progenitor of SN1987A in broad terms(see Utrobin
et al. 2015). Our results show that
the general absorption

10

Alp et al.

properties of all non-stripped models are relatively similar. This
is most clearly seen from the CDFs in Figure 5 and the values
in Table 4. The differences between the direction-averaged
properties of the models are comparable to the asymmetry
uncertainties within each model. This indicates that the effects
of progenitor properties and asymmetry uncertainties are
comparable for a given SN type.

Observations of nearby SNRs ﬁnd dust masses of ∼0.1M☉
or larger in CasA(Rho et al. 2008; Barlow et al. 2010), the
Crab Nebula(Gomez et al. 2012; Owen & Barlow 2015), and
SN1987A (Matsuura et al. 2011, 2015; Indebetouw et al.
2014; Dwek & Arendt 2015). Molecules composed of metals
have also been detected in CasA(Rho et al. 2012), the Crab
Nebula(Barlow et al. 2013; Bentley et al. 2018), and
SN1987A (Kamenetzky et al. 2013; Abellán et al. 2017;
Matsuura et al. 2017). However, the formation of dust and
molecules from the ejecta material only has a small effect on
the X-ray absorption properties(Morrison & McCammon 1983;
Draine 2003). Photoabsorption in soft X-rays is dominated by
inner-shell absorption, which is approximately the same for
dust and molecules as
their constituents and Compton
scattering only depends on the electron column density.

Additionally, we do not consider the effects of the compact
object kick velocity. A full treatment would require investigation
of absorption to all positions that the compact object can have
been kicked to, but
the 3D kick velocity is rarely known.
Some insight into the possible effects of kick velocities on
absorption is provided by Figure 3, which shows at what radii
the gas contributes to the optical depth. For kick velocities of
∼500kms−1, the maximum effect on the optical depth is ∼50%
if the kick happens to be aligned with our line of sight. For
reference, we note that pulsars are inferred from observations to
have 3D kick velocities of ∼400±250kms−1(Hobbs et al.
2005; Faucher-Giguère & Kaspi 2006), with some extreme cases
up to 1600kms−1 (Cordes et al. 1993; Chatterjee & Cordes
2002, 2004; Hobbs et al. 2005).

5.3.1. Progenitor and Explosion Models

All results rely on the SN progenitors and explosion models.
These are not fully self-consistent and it is difﬁcult to exactly
quantify the uncertainties introduced by them. We ﬁnd it
unlikely that the model uncertainties have a major, qualitative
impact on our conclusions. What follows is a brief description
of some of the contributing factors.

The explosion models that we use do not include a longer-
lasting phase of simultaneous accretion and mass outflow
around the NS after the onset of the explosion, as suggested to
exist by present self-consistent models(Müller et al. 2017).
Having such a phase of accretion and outflow instead of the
spherical “wind” that boosts the explosion in the simulations, is
likely to lead to more extreme asymmetries in the innermost
∼0.1M☉ of the ejecta. Therefore, the inner half of the iron-
group matter is likely to be more asymmetrically distributed.
Additionally, the 3D simulations contain no information about
mixing below the grid scale, but this is not important for the
X-ray absorption properties because the absorption only relies
on the total column densities.

Overall, the explosion dynamics is roughly compatible with our
present-day knowledge of how neutrino-driven explosions work.
Moreover, the asymmetries we ﬁnd in the simulations are able to
produce the mixing needed to explain the light curve of
SN1987A(Utrobin et al. 2015),
the morphology of CasA

The Astrophysical Journal, 864:175 (15pp), 2018 September 10
(Wongwathanarat et al. 2017), or, roughly, the asymmetries of SiO
and CO molecules observed in SN1987A(Abellán et al.
2017). However, an important caveat for the SN1987A models
is that they are based on single-star progenitors. The progenitor of
SN1987A was most likely the result of a merger, which is
primarily supported by the triple-ring structure surrounding the SN
(Blondin & Lundqvist 1993; Morris & Podsiadlowski 2007;
Menon & Heger 2017; Urushibata et al. 2018). The mixing
properties of the merger models are different and the masses of the
helium and oxygen cores are also much lower than those for the
single-star progenitors. However, the set of progenitors considered
in our study covers a fairly wide range of pre-collapse proﬁles, and
one case (B15) has a core structure with similarities to the core
properties of some of the binary models of Menon & Heger (2017).
The relative abundances of the different metals are also
small α-nuclei networks(see
uncertain because of
Section 3.1 of Wongwathanarat et al. 2017). This uncertainty
only applies to the relative abundances of metals and leaves the
total mass and spatial distribution unaffected.

the

Model B15, despite its ability to yield efﬁcient mixing and to
explain the SN1987A light curve fairly well, is far from being a
perfect case for SN1987A. In particular, the NS mass is too low.
A baryonic mass of 1.25M☉ corresponds to a gravitational mass
of only ∼1.15M☉. It is extremely unlikely that SN1987A
produced a NS with such a record-low mass(see Özel &
Freire 2016). This problem is most likely due to the progenitor
structure for B15 rather than the explosion modeling.

5.4. Implications for Observations

The high X-ray absorption in young SNRs affects interpreta-
tions of observations. We have focused on CasA and SN1987A,
but the absorption estimates also apply to other extragalactic
SNRs. Processes that produce X-rays from young compact objects
are thermal surface emission, fallback accretion, and pulsar wind
activity. Ejecta absorption obscures any X-ray emission and is
generally applicable, but it is possible that extended sources, such
as powerful pulsar wind nebulae, produce a signiﬁcant amount of
radiation from outer regions where the absorption is expected to be
lower. Another remark on pulsar wind nebulae is that they produce
synchrotron emission that extends to high X-ray energies (for a
high-energy compilation of the pulsed emission, see Figure 28 of
Kuiper & Hermsen 2015) where Compton scattering is dominat-
ing. Given the low scattering depths, the obscuration due to
scattering is most likely only important during the ﬁrst few years.
Another source of high-energy radiation is from radioactive
elements synthesized in SN explosions that emit lines in the
Compton absorption regime when decaying. This was seen in
early observations of SN1987A(Dotani et al. 1987; Sunyaev
et al. 1987; Matz et al. 1988). The ﬁrst sign of radioactive line
emission at intermediate optical depths is the emergence of down-
scattered X-ray emission, which is then followed by the direct line
emission when the ejecta has expanded further. The time and
escaping fluxes of the radioactive emission convey information
about the level of mixing of the radioactive elements and could be
used to test the accuracy of the SN explosion simulations.

Ejecta absorption can potentially also explain the lack of
detection of K-shell emission lines resulting from electron capture
in radioactive elements produced by the SN (Leising 2001, 2006;
Theiling & Leising 2006). Radioactive K-shell lines have been
observed in G1.9+0.3, which is the remnant of a thermonuclear
SN(Borkowski et al. 2010). Because of the lower mass and

11

Alp et al.
higher expansion velocity of TypeIa SNe, the X-ray absorption
should be considerably smaller for a given age.

We focus on absorption toward the center of SNRs. The
absorption along lines of sight that pierce outer parts of the ejecta
have different properties. This is mostly relevant for spatially
resolved studies of SNRs. Figure 3 provides some insight into the
radial distribution of absorbing gas. We do not attempt
to
investigate all possible sightlines. The difference introduced by the
shifting line of sight is not simply a matter of geometrical scaling
because the metallicity is higher for paths into the center and
lower toward the outer boundary of the ejecta. An effect of this in
SN1987A can be seen in Figure 22 and23 of Fransson et al.
(2013). The penetration of the X-rays from the ring interaction is
considerably deeper in the directions of the outer hydrogen
envelope compared to the radial penetration in the core direction.
In SN1987A, the absorption is high and signiﬁcantly affects
observations of the compact object. The analysis is presented in
detail in a separate work(Alp et al. 2018). Here, we note that
the differences in optical depth for the different BSG progenitor
models B15 and N20 are less than a factor of two and the RSGs
also show comparable properties (Section 4). A difference of a
factor of two in the optical depth approximately corresponds to
a factor of two in the allowed luminosities. This uncertainty is
comparable to the other uncertainties discussed in Section 5.3.
The effect of absorption is expected to be relatively small for
the Galactic SNRs. We ﬁnd a negligible effect of absorption on
the interpretation of Chandra observations of the CCO in
CasA (Appendix A). However, observations of SNRs with
higher numbers of total counts or higher energy resolutions
should be able to disentangle small effects of ejecta absorption.
Our estimates also show that the low-energy X-ray emission
from a compact object in a future Galactic SN will be heavily
obscured for many decades. It is unlikely that even future
telescopes will be able to directly observe emission from newly
created compact objects at energies less than ∼5 keV during

6. Summary and Conclusions

Accurate models of absorption are critical for analyses of
X-ray observations of SNRs. We use 3D simulations of
neutrino-driven SN explosions(Wongwathanarat et al. 2013,
2015) to estimate the column densities of the most abundant
elements along the line of sight to the center of the ejecta. The
column densities are used to compute the optical depth for
X-rays due to photoabsorption and Compton scattering. This
provides both the amount and composition of the obscuring gas.
We use our absorption models to place new X-ray limits on the
compact object in SN1987A in an accompanying paper(Alp
et al. 2018), and re-analyze the X-ray spectrum of the CCO in
CasA (Appendix A). Our main conclusions are as follows:

1. The optical depth for X-rays is high for a long time after
the SN explosion. For the models with a hydrogen
envelope, the optical depth between 0.1 and 50keV is

were signiﬁcant. This is a result of the limited statistics

instrumental energy resolution, and

section and stronger metal edges for the absorption proﬁle.

CIAO 4.9 and CALDB 4.7.7(Fruscione et al. 2006) and follow
standard data reduction guidelines. No strong background
flares are detected and the data are ﬁltered by removing all
intervals that deviate from the mean by more than 4σ. All
source spectra are extracted from circular regions with radii
of 2 pixels (492 mas pixel−1). All background spectra are
extracted from annuli centered on the source position. The
inner radii of the annuli are 3 pixels and the outer annuli are 5
pixels. The spectra are binned such that the signal-to-noise
level is at least 10 in each bin. Spectral ﬁtting is performed
using XSPEC version 12.9.1p(Arnaud 1996).

A.2. Results

Our aim is to investigate if ejecta absorption has a signiﬁcant
effect on the interpretation of the observed spectra of the CCO
in CasA. To do this, we choose a model consisting of thermal
emission from an NS surface with a carbon atmosphere, which
is modeled using the XSPEC model carbatm(Suleimanov
et al. 2014). We use the model tbabs(Wilms et al. 2000),
with wilm abundances from Wilms et al. (2000) for the ISM
absorption. The ejecta absorption is modeled using the XSPEC
model tbvarabs(Wilms et al. 2000), which allows for
setting the individual abundances. We take the column
densities of the IIb model (Table 3) because it shows similarity
to CasA(Wongwathanarat et al. 2017). All column densities
are scaled to 340 years, assuming homologous expansion and
ignoring the SNR age difference of the observations. To study
an extreme scenario, we scale the average column densities by
a factor of 4.1. This value is the ratio of the 99.7th percentile of
the optical depth at 2keV to the direction-averaged optical
depth at 2keV. This can be interpreted as a 3σ upper limit on
the ejecta absorption for the IIb model. The result of scaling to
an age of 340 years and taking the 3σ upper limit is that the
optical depth at 1keV is ∼0.2, implying that the total effect of
ejecta absorption is expected to be small.

We perform the ﬁt of the model simultaneously to the three
observations. The results of all ﬁts are presented in Table 6.
First, we start by ignoring any ejecta absorption. The NS mass
is frozen to 1.647M☉ and the radius is frozen to 10.33km, to
allow for comparisons with previous works(Heinke &
Ho 2010; Posselt et al. 2013). The normalization of the NS
carbon atmosphere model is a ratio of the fraction of the surface
that is emitting (A) over the distance squared in units of 10kpc.
We leave the normalization free to allow for any normalization
errors, but tied it across all observations because we do not
expect
the emitting fraction or distance to change. For a

ISM hydrogen column density NISM(H) is left free because the
absorption toward CasA is uncertain(Keohane et al. 1996;
Salas et al. 2018), but it is tied across observations because it is
not expected to vary signiﬁcantly on these timescales.
Additionally, we ﬁnd no statistically signiﬁcant improvement
by leaving NISM(H) untied. The local (unredshifted) blackbody
temperature (T) is left free.

Next, we include the extreme-case 3σ ejecta absorption. The
best-ﬁt parameters are shown in the second segment of Table 6.
The additional ejecta absorption component has no signiﬁcant
impact and the ﬁt remains essentially unchanged. This is
expected because of the low optical depth of ∼0.2 at 1keV,
which implies that the difference should be very small.

the bulk expansion velocity or

To explore a case of signiﬁcant absorption, we add another
factor of 10 to the 3σ absorption. The factor of 10 is arbitrarily
chosen but the scenario could represent a case where the IIb
model overestimates
if
ﬁlamentary structures of higher density have formed along
the line of sight. The best-ﬁt values for this case are also
provided in Table 6. The ﬁt is statistically slightly worse but
still acceptable. The additional ejecta absorption is nearly
completely degenerate with the other components, particularly
the ISM absorption, but also the temperature and normalization
to a certain extent.

The conclusion is that the expected level of ejecta absorption
based on our models has an insigniﬁcant effect on the estimated
temperature of the CCO. The difference in inferred temperature
is less than ∼1% between the ﬁt without and with 3σ ejecta
absorption, which is lower than the statistical uncertainty.
Additionally, the effect is a similar level of decrease at all
epochs, which does not affect investigations of the cooling of
the CCO.

Appendix B

Comparison with ISM Absorption

A comparison of

the SN abundances with the ISM
abundances(Wilms et al. 2000) is provided in Table 3. It is
common in X-ray astronomy to quantify absorption by the
hydrogen column number density and to assume standard
abundances of all other elements with respect to hydrogen. This
assumption breaks down for ejecta absorption because the
metallicity of the SN ejecta is much higher than that of
the ISM. The result is that the effective cross section of the
SN ejecta is much higher, falls slower as a function of energy,
and the metal absorption edges are stronger. The effective cross
sections for the ﬁve models and the ISM, as well as the ratio of
the SN ejecta to ISM cross sections, are shown in Figure 7.

larger, show shallower energy dependencies, and have much stronger discontinuous absorption features.
