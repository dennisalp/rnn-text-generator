Abstract

Supernova 1987A offers a unique opportunity to study an evolving supernova in unprecedented detail over several
decades. The X-ray emission is dominated by interactions between the ejecta and the circumstellar medium,
primarily the equatorial ring (ER). We analyze 3.3Ms of NuSTAR data obtained between 2012 and 2020, and two
decades of XMM-Newton data. Since ∼2013, the ﬂux below 2keV has declined, the 3–8keV ﬂux has increased
but has started to ﬂatten, and the emission above 10keV has remained nearly constant. The spectra are well
described by a model with three thermal shock components. Two components at 0.3 and 0.9keV are associated
with dense clumps in the ER, and a 4keV component may be a combination of emission from diffuse gas in the
ER and the surrounding low-density H II region. We disfavor models that involve nonthermal X-ray emission and
place constraints on nonthermal components, but cannot ﬁrmly exclude an underlying power law. Radioactive lines

1. Introduction

Supernova (SN) 1987A is the closest observed SN in more than
four centuries (Arnett et al. 1989; McCray 1993; McCray &
Fransson 2016). It is a core-collapse SN located in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and was ﬁrst detected on 1987 February
23. The progenitor star, Sanduleak−69° 202(Sanduleak 1970),
was identiﬁed as a B3Ia blue supergiant(West et al. 1987). The
progenitor shaped the circumstellar medium (CSM) around
SN1987A and produced a triple-ring structure (Wampler et al.
1990; Burrows et al. 1995). This structure consists of two larger
ring (ER). Different
outer
explanations for this based on interacting winds (Blondin &
Lundqvist 1993; Martin & Arnett 1995), binary mergers (Morris &
Podsiadlowski 2007; Menon & Heger 2017; Utrobin et al. 2021),
or rapid rotation (Chita et al. 2008) have been proposed. The three
rings are nearly coaxial,
forming an hourglass-like shape
(Chevalier & Dwarkadas 1995; Larsson et al. 2019). They are
nearly circular but appear elliptical because they are viewed at an
inclination of ∼38°–45° (Crotts & Heathcote 2000; Tziamtzis et al.
2011). The X-ray emission that we study in this paper is primarily
due to the interaction with this complex CSM.

rings and a smaller equatorial

At early times, the ejecta from SN1987A propagated through a
low-density H II region inside of the ER, which gave rise to faint
radio and X-ray emission (Staveley-Smith et al. 1992; Chevalier &
Dwarkadas 1995; Hasinger et al. 1996). After approximately
3000 days, the ejecta started interacting with the denser ER. This
interaction produced a signiﬁcant brightening in all wave bands
(Bouchet et al. 2006; Park et al. 2006; Gröningsson et al. 2008; Ng
et al. 2008; Dwek et al. 2010). Notably, high-density clumps inside
the ER produced bright optical “hotspots” (Sonneborn et al. 1998;
Lawrence et al. 2000). More recent observations show that the
optical emission is declining and that new hotspots have appeared

1

outside of the ER (Fransson et al. 2015; Larsson et al. 2019).
Furthermore, the infrared (IR) emission has been declining since
∼9000days (Arendt et al. 2016, 2020), X-rays below 2keV
started decreasing at 10,000days (Frank et al. 2016; Ravi 2019),
and the radio blast wave is now reaccelerating (Cendes et al. 2018).
These observations all show that most of the blast wave is now
propagating past the ER, while the ER is being dissolved.

In addition to the long monitoring of SN1987A in radio,
optical, and X-rays, a potential GeV detection has recently been
reported using Fermi data (Malyshev et al. 2019; Petruk et al.
2019). A major uncertainty is if the emission is truly originating
from SN1987A because the angular resolution of Fermi
is
insufﬁcient to resolve SN1987A from other nearby sources. If
associated with SN1987A, the data suggest an increase in the
GeV ﬂux by a factor of ∼2 between 2010 and 2018, which could
indicate efﬁcient cosmic-ray acceleration in the shocks (Dwarkadas
2013; Berezhko et al. 2015).

The X-ray emission produced by the interactions with the ER
has been extensively studied in the literature (Burrows et al. 2000;
Michael et al. 2002; Park et al. 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2011;
Zhekov et al. 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010; Haberl et al. 2006; Dewey
et al. 2008, 2012; Heng et al. 2008; Racusin et al. 2009; Sturm
et al. 2009, 2010; Maggi et al. 2012; Helder et al. 2013; Orlando
et al. 2015, 2019; Frank et al. 2016; Miceli et al. 2019; Bray et al.
2020; Greco et al. 2021; Sun et al. 2021). For brevity, we only
summarize the most relevant ﬁndings from the previous studies.
The ER is resolved by Chandra, which allows for studies of the
morphology and expansion velocity. Comparisons with other
wavelengths show that X-rays below 2keV are generally more
strongly correlated with optical, whereas harder X-rays better
follow the radio evolution. The X-ray emission has been
interpreted as predominantly or completely of thermal origin.

The Astrophysical Journal, 916:76 (30pp), 2021 August 1
The detection of the FeK line complex clearly shows that thermal
emission is important at energies up to ∼10keV.

Thermal models for the X-ray spectra require multiple
components of different temperatures. This is not unexpected
given the complex structure of the CSM around SN1987A, but
it is difﬁcult to uniquely associate each spectral component
with one of the many possible emission regions. The most
likely origins for the X-ray emission are: the dense ER clumps,
the diffuse ER, the H II region, the reverse shock propagating
into the ejecta, and reﬂected shocks off the ER clumps.
However, it remains uncertain if there is a contribution from a
nonthermal component. Possible origins for an additional
component are shock-accelerated electrons, high-temperature
free–free emission, or a pulsar wind nebula (PWN).

In addition to the thermal emission, there are a number of
lines that result from radioactive decay (Diehl 2018). Explosive
nucleosynthesis in SN explosions produces unstable proton-
rich isotopes that decay by electron capture. This gives rise to
different types of radioactive lines, one of which is nuclear de-
excitation lines. The most prominent example at current epochs
is the pair of lines at 67.87 and 78.32keV, which are produced
chain (Grebenev et al. 2012;
by the
Boggs et al. 2015). Technically, Ti
decays into an excited
nuclear state of Sc44
, and these lines are emitted when the Sc44
nucleus de-excite to its ground state (Cameron & Singh 1999).
However, these lines are conventionally referred to as the Ti
lines.

asymmetries, as well as the initial
advantages of these nuclear radioactive lines are that
the
emission escapes the ejecta practically unattenuated at current
epochs (Alp et al. 2018a) and that the emission is proportional
to the mass. The proportionality constant is known through the
85yr lifetime (Ahmad et al. 2006) and is not dependent on any

Another type of radioactive line is electron capture K-shell
emission lines (Leising 2001). This is a result of the electron
capture process leaving a vacancy in the K-shell. When the

The line energies and, in particular, the electron capture
decay rates are often treated as constants, but depend on the
level of ionization (Mochizuki et al. 1999; Laming 2001;
Motizuki & Kumagai 2004). This is primarily signiﬁcant for
ionization to H-like, He-like, or completely ionized states. The
inner ejecta where the bulk of the radioactive elements reside
are not expected to be highly ionized (Jerkstrand et al. 2011).

Alp, Larsson, & Fransson

Therefore, the standard values measured for neutral atoms can
be applied to the radioactive line energies and decay rates
relevant for SN1987A.

Neutrinos were detected from the core collapse of SN1987A
(Hirata et al. 1987), which signaled the formation of a neutron
star. No further unequivocal evidence for the neutron star has
been presented, and it remains uncertain if it collapsed further
into a black hole. Numerous searches have been performed
(Graves et al. 2005; Manchester 2007; Alp et al. 2018a, 2018b;
Esposito et al. 2018; Cigan et al. 2019; Page et al. 2020; Greco
et al. 2021), but only tentative indications have been found.
Cigan et al. (2019) reported a possible sign of localized energy
input by a neutron star in a 679GHz ALMA image. They
suggested heating by thermal surface neutron star emission
(Alp et al. 2018b; Page et al. 2020) or the emergence of a
PWN, which was also suggested by Zanardo et al. (2014).
Recently, Greco et al. (2021) interpreted the X-ray emission
above 10keV as indications of a PWN.

In this paper, we study new NuSTAR data from 2020,
together with archival NuSTAR data from 2012 to 2014
(Boggs et al. 2015; Greco et al. 2021). To extend the energy
range and time span, we also include archival XMM-Newton
observations spanning nearly two decades. These XMM-
Newton observations have previously been analyzed in a
number of separate studies focused on different aspects of the
data (Haberl et al. 2006; Heng et al. 2008; Sturm et al. 2010;
Maggi et al. 2012; Sun et al. 2021.)

The main focus is the interpretation of the 0.45–24keV
spectrum and a possible contribution from a nonthermal
component, which could be connected to the GeV emission or
44
a PWN. We analyze the radioactive Ti
lines using NuSTAR and
and Sc44
place limits on the radioactive Mn
lines using XMM-
Newton. NuSTAR is also used to constrain the pulsed fraction
and put a deep upper limit on the contribution from a compact
object. Finally, we put the compact object limit into context by
comparing it with previous multiwavelength observations.

This paper

is organized as

follows. We present

the
observations constituting the main data set in Section 2 and
the methods used for the analysis in Section 3. The results are
contained in Section 4 and discussed in Section 5. We provide a
summary and highlight
the conclusions in Section 6. Two
independent parts of the analysis are separated into appendices.
In Appendix A, we search for pulsed emission in the 2012–2014
NuSTAR data. We analyze the radioactive K-shell lines from
55
using 2000–2003 XMM-Newton data in
Appendix B. Finally, we explore the calibration uncertainties
of NuSTAR and XMM-Newton in Appendices C and D.

2. Observations and Data Reduction

We focus on the NuSTAR (Harrison et al. 2013) observa-
tions of SN1987A but include XMM-Newton (Jansen et al.
2001) data to extend the lower energy bound to 0.45keV and
resolve the X-ray line emission. Accurate modeling of the line
emission is important for the interpretation of the entire X-ray
spectrum.
Including XMM-Newton data also extends the
temporal baseline for ﬂux measurements back to 2003. We
use XMM-Newton instead of Chandra primarily because we do
not need to spatially resolve the ER. Instead, we prioritize the
better photon statistics provided by the larger effective area of
XMM-Newton. For the data reduction and analysis, we use
HEAsoft 6.27.2.

Note. The net source counts in each of the two NuSTAR modules are given by CA and CB. Counts are given for two different energy ranges as indicated by the
subscripts. The observations with 0 counts are results of no bins (after binning to a minimum of 25 counts per bin) passing the energy range requirement as
implemented by the ignore task in XSPEC due to short exposures.

2.1. NuSTAR

The NuSTAR telescope has an energy range of 3–78.4keV
resolution of 18″ (FWHM). The spatial
and an angular
resolution is insufﬁcient to resolve the ER (∼1″) but clearly
separates SN1987A from any other sources. The energy
resolution has an FWHM response of 0.4keV at 10keV and
0.9keV at 60keV. This spectral resolution allows for the
separation of isolated lines and line complexes from the
continuum but does not resolve ﬁner structures or crowded
spectral regions. NuSTAR has two mirror assemblies and two
corresponding focal plane CCD modules (FPMs), referred to as
FPMA and FPMB. The two parallel setups are practically
identical but all data are analyzed separately and only
combined for presentation purposes.

We use all on-axis NuSTAR observations of SN1987A
(Table 1), which constitute a total exposure time of 3.3Ms. The
majority of the data are from 2012 to 2014. These were previously
lines (Boggs et al. 2015) and the
used to study the radioactive Ti
continuum (Greco et al. 2021). To complement these data, we
obtained new observations in 2020 May, which allow us to study
the recent temporal evolution. There are 17 individual observations
in total, but these constitute eight groups of observations that are
quasi-simultaneous (within two weeks; see Table 1). Henceforth,
the observations within each group are treated as simultaneous, but
the data are not combined except for presentation purposes.

44

The NuSTAR data reduction largely follows

standard
procedures. To reduce the data, we use NuSTARDAS 1.9.2
and NuSTAR CALDB version 20200726. First, calibrations and
ﬁlters are applied using the nupipeline task. The exposures
are ﬁltered for passages through the South Atlantic Anomaly.
This is a trade-off between exposure time and background. We
check the SAA ﬁlter reports and use the options saacalc=1,
saamode=strict, and tentacle=yes.

Spectra are then generated using the standard task nupro-
ducts. Source counts are extracted from a circular region
centered on SN1987A, shown in Figure 1. We choose a radius
of 30″, which is recommended for weaker sources by the

NuSTAR Observatory Guide.3 This results in an encircled
energy fraction of approximately 50%. SN1987A is relatively
weak above 8keV, which is the energy range that is most
important for the analysis. Background regions are selected
from the same CCD chip as the source. The vicinity of
SN1987A is free of strong NuSTAR sources, but bright X-ray
sources outside the ﬁeld of view (FoV) introduce stray light
into the FoV (Madsen et al. 2017b). In general, we aim to select
background regions that are squares with sides of 4 5, while
excluding a region around SN1987A and stray light. The
excluded region around SN1987A is a circle with a radius of
90″ (see Figure 1).

We limit the energy range used for the continuum analysis to
3–24keV. Both the ﬂux and effective area quickly decrease
toward higher energies, resulting in a signal-to-background
ratio (S/B) lower than 0.3. The low S/B above 24keV results
in a very high sensitivity to background systematics. Finally,
the spectra are grouped to at least 25 counts per bin.

2.2. XMM-Newton

D ~

E

XMM-Newton operates six instruments in parallel: the pn
CCD (Strüder et al. 2001), MOS1 and MOS2 (Turner et al.
2001), two grating spectrometers (den Herder et al. 2001), and
the optical monitor (Mason et al. 2001). Here, we focus on the
pn CCD and the reﬂection grating spectrometers (RGSs). The
pn camera covers 0.3–10keV with a spectral resolution of
E
20–50, which is comparable to the NuSTAR energy
resolution. The RGSs cover 0.35–2.5keV and provide
E
to resolve the large
number of lines in this energy range. The angular resolution is
approximately 6″ (FWHM)
for both pn and the cross-
dispersion direction of the RGSs, which does not resolve the
ER. The RGS apertures extend across the entire 30′ FoV along
the dispersion direction, but
the effective area decreases

200–600, which is sufﬁcient

Notes. The net source counts in the different instruments are given by CRGS1, CRGS2, and Cpn. All counts are for the standard energy ranges we use for the analysis (see
text). The RGS counts are for ﬁrst order only. The differences between RGS1 and RGS2 are primarily driven by the different nonoperational CCDs. The total counts in
the second-order spectra are 45% of the ﬁrst-order counts for RGS1 and 26% for RGS2.

other sources are confused with SN1987A. Contamination
along the dispersion direction of the RGSs can be identiﬁed by
comparing the dispersion angle to the energy estimate from the
RGS CCD readouts.

We primarily focus on the most

recent XMM-Newton
observations for the joint NuSTAR-XMM analysis but include
13 publicly available XMM-Newton observations in total for a
longer temporal baseline (Table 2). Due to modest levels of
pileup (detailed below), we only use CCD data from the pn

CCD, and not the MOS CCDs (Turner et al. 2001). Pileup is
not present in the RGS data.

For the data reduction, we use XMM SAS 18.0.0 (Gabriel
et al. 2004) with XMM CCF updated on 2020 August 3. Most
steps of the data reduction follow default standards. We
reprocess the data with the latest calibrations and ﬁlter the data
for high-background intervals (Table 2).

For the pn data, we extract source spectra from a circular
region centered on SN1987A with a radius of 30″, shown in
Figure 2. This is a typical source extraction radius and results in

an encircled energy of 80%–90% depending on energy (lower
for higher energies). A larger source radius would only increase
the signal marginally while lowering the S/B. For reference, a
source radius of 90″ results in an encircled energy of 90%–
95%, while increasing the background from ∼1% to almost
10%. Backgrounds are extracted from circular regions from the
same CCD chip (#4) with radii of approximately 60″
(Figure 2). The very high S/B implies that
the choice of
background has a negligible impact on the analysis. The RGS
spectra are constructed using the default source and back-
ground regions. A heliocentric correction to the photon
energies is also applied to the RGS data by default.

We pay special attention to pileup in the CCD spectra. Pileup
occurs when multiple photons hit the same or adjacent pixels
within the same readout frame. The results are that some
photons are rejected as invalid events, and an artiﬁcial
hardening of the spectrum as the energies of multiple photons
are combined. Pileup affects approximately 5% of the events
when the photon ﬂux peaks around the year 2014. This is
estimated using the task epatplot, which compares the
observed event patterns with expected pattern distributions.

signiﬁcantly affect the ﬁts. The bins with the most photons
have statistical uncertainties as low as 1%. We use the task

for pileup, which is enabled by the option correctforpi-
leup=yes. The ancillary response ﬁles (ARFs) are then
generated using the standard task arfgen.

The CCD spectra are grouped to a minimum of 25 counts per
bin using specgroup. Additionally, we impose a minimum
bin size corresponding to one-third of the energy resolution
FWHM using the parameter oversample=3. The RGS
spectra are also binned to a minimum of 25 counts per bin, but
using the general task grppha. The large number of photons
allows for this binning without signiﬁcantly downsampling the
energy resolutions of the RGSs.

We limit the energy range of the pn data to 0.8–10keV. The
lower bound of 0.8keV is higher than the lower calibration
limit of 0.3keV. We ignore data below 0.8keV because of
inconsistencies between the pn and RGS spectra of up to 5%

close to strong lines, which are likely due to calibration
uncertainties. The pn spectral bins have individual statistical
uncertainties as low as ±1% at low energies, which implies that
slight calibration issues could signiﬁcantly reduce the goodness
of ﬁt. The calibration accuracy is known to decrease toward
lower energies
see also
Figures D1 and D2), possibly due to the lowest-energy internal
calibration line of pn being at 1.5keV (Strüder et al. 2001). We
choose the 0.8keV limit as a trade-off between using as much
data as possible and introducing calibration tensions into
the ﬁts.

(Plucinsky et al. 2008, 2017;

We use RGS data from both RGS1 and RGS2, and ﬁrst and
second order. An RGS1 image showing the dispersed data is
provided in Figure 3. The two ﬁrst-order spectra cover the
energy range from 0.45 to 1.95keV, whereas the second-order
spectra range from 0.70 to 1.95keV. The low-energy cutoff of
0.45keV implies that we include the strong N VII Lyα line at
0.50keV, below which very few photons are detected.
Additionally, the parts of the RGS spectra that coincide with
nonoperational CCDs are excluded.

3. Analysis

We use XSPEC 12.11.0 for spectral ﬁtting and use the
photoabsorption cross sections of Verner & Yakovlev (1995).
We follow the XSPEC convention of the photon index Γ being
given by µ -G
E , where N is the photon ﬂux density and E
the photon energy. Furthermore, the spectral binning of at least
25 counts per bin allows for the use of c2 statistics.

N

Conﬁdence intervals are computed using the error
command in XSPEC. All intervals are 90% unless otherwise
stated, whereas one-sided limits are 3σ. The error command
the c2 value reaches a given
varies the parameters until
threshold. We adopt a critical value of 2.706, which is
commonly used in X-ray analyses. However, we stress that this
technically only represents the 90% interval for one parameter
of interest (Avni 1976; Cash 1976; Lampton et al. 1976). The
same argument applies to the 3σ limits, for which we use a
corresponding threshold of 7.740.

The Astrophysical Journal, 916:76 (30pp), 2021 August 1

We use different combinations of data sets for different
purposes. For the ﬂux estimates, we prioritize good ﬁts to
individual epochs. Therefore, we only use NuSTAR data for
NuSTAR ﬂuxes and pn and RGS data for XMM-Newton
ﬂuxes. For the spectral analysis, we perform joint ﬁts to
NuSTAR and RGS data. We omit the XMM-Newton/pn data
in these ﬁts due to calibration uncertainties, which could
introduce systematic effects. The signiﬁcance of the calibration
uncertainties is exacerbated by the large number of photons in
the pn data. We discuss the magnitude and characteristics of the
instrumental uncertainties further in Appendix C. Furthermore,
Appendix D investigates the effects of including pn in the data
analysis, as well as explores a number of other alternatives for
how to manage the systematic uncertainties. The primary
conclusion is that different choices affect the best-ﬁt values
quantitatively but the qualitative scientiﬁc conclusions remain
unchanged.

For all ﬁts, we leave a free cross-normalization constant
between different
instruments to accommodate calibration
uncertainties. The cross-normalizations also allow for some
freedom between the NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observa-
tions, which are separated in time. These constants are
generally ﬁtted to values within 0.9–1.1, with most values
being close to unity. For some ﬁts, the constants deviate by
more than 10% from unity, but this is predominantly due to the
time difference between some of the NuSTAR and XMM-
Newton observations. This shows that the cross-normalizations
primarily capture calibration uncertainties and to some extent
also the temporal evolution between nonsimultaneous observa-
tions. Importantly, these constants do not drift to unreasonable
values, which would indicate problems with the ﬁts.

3.1. Spectral Modeling

For spectral modeling, we consistently use the same base
model unless otherwise stated. It consists of an absorption
component, a Gaussian smoothing kernel, and three shocked
plasma components.4 We use the Tuebingen-Boulder inter-
stellar medium (ISM) absorption model (TBabs; Wilms et al.
2000), gsmooth for smoothing, and vpshock for the plasma
emission. We use three duplicates of the shock component to
properly capture the range of temperatures that contribute to the
spectrum in the 0.45–24keV range (Section 4.2 and Appendix D).
Below, we describe the components in more detail.

The absorption component has only one free parameter, which
is the H column density (NH). We stress that this is the total H
density, including both atomic H and molecular H2 (Willingale
et al. 2013). Solely for the absorption, we adopt the Milky Way
ISM abundances of Wilms et al. (2000). Implications of this on
the estimated NH are discussed in Section 3.2.

The Gaussian smoothing represents the broadening of the
spectral lines due to the bulk and turbulent motion of the
emitting plasma (Appendix of Dewey et al. 2012). The amount
of Doppler blurring in units of energy is proportional to the
energy. This implies that the exponent (α) for the gsmooth
energy dependence is always frozen to 1. Thus, the only free
parameter of the smoothing component is the magnitude of the
blurring measured by s of the Gaussian kernel. Freezing α to 1
implicitly assumes that the emission is produced by gas with
the same bulk velocity. Neither assumption is likely strictly

fulﬁlled. However, we ﬁx it at 1 because we ﬁnd negligible
improvements when leaving it as a free parameter.

The vpshock component (Borkowski et al. 2001) is based on
calculations of X-ray spectra using an SN blast-wave model. The
main parameters are the shock temperature (T), ionization age (τ),
and emission measure (EM). The EM is implemented as the
XSPEC normalization but can be converted to an EM using a
distance of 51.2kpc to SN1987A (Panagia et al. 1991; Mitchell
et al. 2002). The vpshock model also allows for variable
abundances (Section 3.2). The model assumes an adiabatic, one-
dimensional plasma shock with constant temperature propagating
into a uniform CSM. This is clearly oversimpliﬁed compared to
the complex ER structure. At X-ray energies below ∼2keV, the
shocks producing the emission in SN1987A are also likely
radiative and not adiabatic (Pun et al. 2002; Gröningsson et al.
2008). A radiative shock produces softer emission compared to an
adiabatic shock at the same temperature, as well as different line
ratios (Nymark et al. 2006). These effects add additional
systematic uncertainties into the absorption and abundance
estimates discussed below. The vpshock model also assumes
a Maxwellian electron velocity distribution and no cosmic-ray
modiﬁcations. Accelerated cosmic rays could diffuse upstream
and form a shock precursor that decelerates the gas ahead of the
shock (Borkowski et al. 2001). This would lead to a lower
temperature than in the standard, nonmodiﬁed shock of the same
velocity.

3.2. Fixed Parameters

There are a number of spectral parameters that we keep
constant throughout the time range spanned by our observa-
tions. These parameters are the ISM absorption column density,
line broadening, elemental abundances, and redshift (Tables 3
and 4). We initially perform a ﬁt to determine these parameters.
This is done to avoid having to ﬁt all spectra simultaneously
with an excessive number of free parameters. All these constant
parameters are primarily constrained by the RGS spectra and,
to some extent, the pn spectra. Thus, for this particular ﬁt, we
simultaneously ﬁt the model to three XMM-Newton observa-
tions: 9423, 10,141, and 11,192days (Table 2). The choice of
these observations offers a trade-off between exposure time,
covering the NuSTAR epochs, and a short enough time range
during which spectral variations are moderate.

For this ﬁt, we tie all parameters that are expected to be
constant. Each observation epoch consists of one pn spectrum
and four RGS spectra. Among these ﬁve spectra, the plasma
temperature,
ionization age, and EM are tied across the
instruments. The setup is the same for each of the three plasma
components. These plasma parameters are not tied between
observations because they evolve signiﬁcantly with time. The

latter), which are too high to result in statistically acceptable ﬁts
to the XMM-Newton (mainly RGS) data. Additionally, optical
extinction estimates show that the LMC contribution is greater
than the Milky Way contribution (Fitzpatrick & Walborn 1990;
France et al. 2011). This implies that the X-ray absorption to
SN1987A should be even higher
than the Galactic H I
estimates.

There are two likely contributing factors to our apparent
underestimation of NH. First,
the employed adiabatic model
(Section 3.1) produces harder spectra than radiative shocks
(Nymark et al. 2006). This could artiﬁcially suppress NH in order
to produce a softer absorbed spectrum. Second, we use the
Galactic abundances of Wilms et al. (2000) for the absorption
component to reduce complexity. In reality, the gas along the line
of sight could be of lower metallicity, especially the LMC
absorption component. This would also have the effect of
lowering the ﬁtted NH to compensate for an assumed metallicity
that is too high. However, we note that our X-ray estimate of NH
is comparable to those obtained by other X-ray analyses. For
21cm−2, and

ences are small in light of the different modeling techniques and

1021cm−2 may be underestimated due to systematic

uncertainties, but we use it in all subsequent ﬁts because it

We leave the abundances of all trace elements to their default
values, namely 1.0 relative to our adopted ISM abundances. All
ﬁts are insensitive to these trace elements. We test this by
setting the abundances of all trace elements to 0.0 using the
command NEI_TRACE_ABUND. The c2 value ﬂuctuates by a
few, and all ﬁtted parameters are practically unchanged.

3.3. Flux Estimation

To estimate ﬂuxes, we use the model and parameters described
above. The model is ﬁtted simultaneously to all spectra within the
groups of NuSTAR observations and within each XMM-Newton
observation. The free parameters are the temperatures, ionization
ages, and EMs for each of the shock components, and a free
cross-normalization between the instruments. The NuSTAR data
are unable to robustly constrain the coolest plasma component.
Therefore, we freeze its parameters to the values from the ﬁts to
the XMM-Newton data that are closest in time. This component is
almost completely below the lower energy limit of NuSTAR and
does not affect the ﬂuxes signiﬁcantly. The parameters of each
plasma component that are ﬁtted for are tied across instruments
because the spectra are (quasi-)simultaneous. The average reduced
ﬁt statistic is c = 0.93
with an average of 347 DoF for the
NuSTAR epochs. The corresponding numbers for the XMM-
Newton observations are c = 1.2

and 1555 DoF.

We measure ﬂuxes using the XSPEC component cﬂux,
which has a parameter that corresponds to the ﬂux. After ﬁtting
the model, the cross-calibration constant is replaced by cﬂux,

and the model is reﬁtted. This results in a ﬂux estimate from
each spectrum, which also captures the calibration differences
between the instruments. We report the weighted average as the
best-estimate ﬂux, but
the individual ﬂux measurements
provide a handle on the level of systematics (Appendix C).
All reported ﬂuxes are observed (not correcting for ISM
absorption) due to the uncertain amount of absorption and to
allow for comparisons with previous studies.

3.4. Continuous Temperature Model Setup

In addition to the standard model, we use a more complex
model for the joint NuSTAR and RGS spectral analysis. It is
the same as the base model except
the three shock
components are replaced by a distribution of shocks over a
continuous temperature interval (Zhekov et al. 2006, 2009),
analogous to the XSPEC model c6pvmkl (Lemen et al. 1989;
Singh et al. 1996). The distribution of shock EMs is given by

ability to capture the complex underlying physics. It has only

4. Results

4.1. Light Curves

We report observed ﬂuxes in a number of different energy
bands. For NuSTAR, we study the 3–8, 10–24, and 3–24keV
ranges. The 3–8keV is the “hard” band in XMM-Newton and
Chandra contexts. XMM-Newton ﬂuxes are provided in the
0.5–2, 3–8, and 0.5–8keV bands, in line with previous studies
(e.g., Frank et al. 2016). Additionally, we also compute the
0.45–0.7keV ﬂux, which is dominated by N VII and O VIII
Lyα. All NuSTAR ﬂuxes are provided in Table 5, whereas the
XMM-Newton ﬂuxes are provided in Appendix E.

The light curves are shown in Figure 4. In addition to
NuSTAR and XMM-Newton, we show the HST R-band
(WFPC2/F675W, ACS/F625W, WFC3/F625W; Larsson
et al. 2019), 4.5 μm Spitzer (Arendt et al. 2020), and 9GHz
radio (Cendes et al. 2018) light curves. The two most recent
HST data points are previously unpublished, but are computed
using the same methods as the other data points and include
only the ER emission. The observations were obtained on 2019
July 22 (11,837 days) and 2020 August 6 (12,218 days).

temporal evolutions.

It is apparent that the 3–8keV light curves and the 9GHz
radio show similar
the
10–24keV component increases at a lower relative rate. We
note that the 0.5–2keV ﬂux clearly starts decreasing after
around 10,000 days and that the rise of the 3–8keV ﬂux slows
slightly after 11,000 days. This is also reported by Sun et al.
(2021) using XMM-Newton data, as well as in a preliminary
study of recent Chandra observations (Ravi 2019). These
spectral changes are captured by the hardness ratios shown in
Figure 5. This illustrates how the 3–8keV ﬂux becomes
increasingly dominant, with the spectra hardening in the
XMM-Newton energy range and softening in the NuSTAR
range. Finally, we note that the 0.45–0.7keV evolution is more
strongly correlated with the decaying optical ﬂux than the
0.5–2keV light curve.

The offset of ∼10%–15% between the NuSTAR and XMM-
Newton 3–8keV light curves reveal a systematic difference

(Appendix C). However, for our conclusions, we focus on the
evolution as observed by the same instrument, which should be
free from large systematics.

There are indications of variability of approximately 5%
between the NuSTAR epochs on timescales of a few weeks
(among groups 1–3 and 5–7). We caution that these variations
might be due to observational uncertainties,
instrumental
origin, or the data reduction process.

4.2. Standard Shock Model

We ﬁt the spectral model with three shock components to all
NuSTAR and RGS data sets. Figure 6 shows the best-ﬁt model,
its three components, and data from the ﬁrst NuSTAR epoch
(9331 days). The standard model provides an adequate ﬁt, and
no additional component is statistically necessary (Section 4.5).
the 0.45–24keV spectrum cannot be
adequately modeled by a two-shock component model. This

For completeness, we provide all best-ﬁt parameters, ﬂuxes of
shock components, and ﬁt statistics in Appendix F. We caution
that
the ionization ages for the three components may be
unreliable. This is most evident
the mid-temperature
component, which has a pegged ionization age at all epochs
(Table F1). In particular, there appears to be too much freedom
in the ﬁts when the ionization ages of the three components are
completely free. It is also probable that the ﬁtted ionization ages
are sensitive to underlying model uncertainties (Section 3.1).
The ﬁtted parameterization (Equation (2)) of the ionization age
used in the continuous shock model
is likely more robust
(Section 4.4).

0.5–2keV, whereas the hard is 3–8keV. These error bars only include the statistical uncertainty because ratios are computed using homogeneous instrumental setups
in each band.

Figure 6. Upper panel: unfolded observed spectra (absorbed but corrected for the instrument responses) from NuSTAR (blue), RGS (orange), and the model (black) in ﬂux
space. The NuSTAR data are plotted up to 65keV (just below the Ti
lines), but the ﬁts are performed using only data up to 24keV. For visual clarity, we show the sum of the
six individual NuSTAR exposures from the ﬁrst epoch at 9331days and only the ﬁrst-order RGS1 data from 9423 days. Both the NuSTAR and RGS data are also rebinned
(represented by the horizontal error bars). The vertical error bars are s1 intervals. The thin dashed lines are the low- (light gray), mid- (gray), and high-temperature (dark gray)
shock components that constitute the model. The dotted green line is the nonthermal synchrotron prediction from Berezhko et al. (2015). It is not part of the ﬁtted model but is
overplotted for reference. The synchrotron component is shown for 9280 days, close to the predicted time of the synchrotron maximum. Although the green synchrotron
prediction appears to match two bins around 20keV, an additional component is not statistically motivated (Section 4.5) and the synchrotron prediction is only marginally
consistent with the data above 24keV (Section 5.4). Lower panel: normalized residuals between data and model. This difference is computed in count space, implying that the
model is forward-folded and then compared to the data. The nonthermal synchrotron component (dotted green line) is not part of the model used for computing the residuals.

4.3. The Fe Kα Line

Due to the importance of the FeK lines, we show the
integrated FeK complex in Figure 8. The FeK blend is clearly

detected and implies that at least a signiﬁcant fraction of the
emission at high energies is thermal (see further Section 5.3).
The observed line centroid in the NuSTAR data is ∼6.59keV

and ∼6.66keV in the XMM-Newton data. We note that Sun
et al. (2021) performed a more detailed, time-resolved analysis
of the Fe line. They ﬁnd that the line centroid increases from
around 6.60keV at 8500days to 6.67keV at 12,000 days.

(2012)

A line energy of 6.66keV approximately corresponds to
Fe XXIII, which is consistent with a thermal origin of temperature
>1 keV (Makishima 1986; Kallman et al. 2004). Its identiﬁcation
is only indicative, and the spectrum clearly has
as Fe XXIII
contributions from a range of ionization levels. For reference,
Maggi et al.
reported an emission-line centroid of
6.60±0.01keV and a width of ∼100eV. From this, they infer
the presence of ionization stages from Fe XVII to Fe XXIV, which
is in agreement with our result.

Our model spectrum is completely dominated by the 4keV
shock component at these energies (Figure 6) and it captures the
line proﬁle well. Previous, more careful XMM-Newton analyses
of the Fe line have reported that there is a signiﬁcant contribution
of lower ionization levels around 6.5keV, which is not captured
by a thermal shock model (Sturm et al. 2010; Maggi et al. 2012).
Maggi et al. (2012) suggested that this could originate from
ﬂuorescence from near-neutral Fe, including Fe in the unshocked
ejecta. We do not investigate this in detail, but Figure 8 shows that
any low-ionization contribution is clearly much weaker than the
dominant component from the thermal shock model.

4.4. Continuous Shock Model

In this section, we report

the results of the continuous
temperature shock model (Section 3.4). The EM distributions
are shown in Figure 9. The distributions at all epochs are
qualitatively similar, with three peaks at shock temperatures
around 0.3, 0.9, and 4keV. The isolated peak around 4keV
appears to be robustly separated from the lower-temperature
components. The reduced c2 for all ﬁts are in the range
1.05–1.15, with an average number of DoF of 1685.

We caution that the apparent bimodality separating the 0.3 and
0.9keV peaks is only marginally signiﬁcant. We draw this
conclusion because some ﬁts using different initial conditions ﬁnd
solutions with a single, broad hump ranging from 0.3 to 1keV.

Figure 8. Spectral ﬁts around the FeK complex in count space. The panels are
structured similarly to Figure 6. For visual clarity, the data shown are the sum
of all NuSTAR data (blue crosses) and the sum of the eight XMM-Newton/pn
observations after 8500 days. The summed data are not suited for detailed
spectral ﬁtting. Instead, we overplot
to the NuSTAR data at
9920 days, which is close to the average best-ﬁt. The solid (NuSTAR) and
dashed (XMM-Newton) black lines are the same underlying model but produce
different ﬂuxes because of the different instrumental responses. We stress that
the large amount of data (∼500 photons per bin in NuSTAR) makes even small
ﬂux and energy differences appear highly signiﬁcant. The bin size is 0.04keV
for both NuSTAR and XMM-Newton. For reference, the absolute energy
calibration around the FeK complex is 0.04keV for NuSTAR (Madsen
et al. 2015) and 0.01keV for XMM-Newton/pn.

visual clarity, but the τ parameterizations for the different NuSTAR epochs are
similar. The vertical dotted lines are the temperatures for the ﬁrst (blue; 2012
September) and last (gray; 2020 May) NuSTAR epochs that are obtained by
ﬁtting the standard model with three shock components. We note that the mid-
temperature lines close to 1keV are almost overlapping. The points are the
ﬁtted τ for the respective plasma components, and the triangles are lower limits
in cases where τ is unconstrained. All parameter values from the ﬁts using three
shock components are provided in Table F1.

These solutions are only marginally statistically worse. Regardless
of the detailed structure of the distribution below 2keV, it is still
clear
there is a contribution from a broad range of
temperatures in the range 0.3–0.9keV. We reiterate that the
shock model relies on a number of assumptions, which introduce

that

additional uncertainties (Section 3.1). It is not computationally
feasible to perform a formal error analysis for the EM distribution.
Consequently, we note that some of
the EM distribution
variability between epochs could be insigniﬁcant. For analyzing
the temporal evolution, the light curves (Section 4.1) and three-
shock model ﬁts (Section 4.2) are more robust.

As noted in Section 4.2,
the free ionization ages for the

The ﬁt of the parameterized ionization age for the continuous
model discussed here is likely more robust, but we caution that
systematics certainly are present at some level, in particular for
shock temperatures as low as 0.3keV, because these shocks
are likely not adiabatic (Section 3.1).

Figure 9 also shows the best-ﬁt temperatures for ﬁts using
the standard three-shock-component model. Only temperatures
for the ﬁrst and last epochs are shown, but similar temperatures
are obtained for all data sets (Figure 7). This indicates that the
simpler three-component model captures the same three peaks
in the EM distribution reasonably well. The slight shift of the
coolest component to ∼0.5keV, in contrast to ∼0.3keV for
the continuous model, could possibly be explained by a bias
due to the absorption. The absorption drastically reduces the
number of photons below ∼0.7keV, which implies that it
could be statistically favorable to ﬁt the coolest component to
slightly higher temperatures when the model is restricted to
only three shock components.

4.5. Constraints on Nonthermal Emission

We ﬁnd no indications of a nonthermal contribution to the
X-ray spectrum. The thermal models describe the data well and
neither replacing the hottest plasma component with a cutoff
PL nor adding an additional PL component results in a better
model. Below, we motivate this conclusion in more detail.

First, we use the standard three-shock model, but replace the
hottest shock component with a cutoff PL. This phenomen-
ological cutoff PL can be interpreted as a hot 10–20keV free–
free component or synchrotron emission, or to potentially
represent a PWN. The photon index of the cutoff PL is frozen
to Γ=2 to prevent degeneracies with the shock components.
This value for Γ is similar to that of the Crab Nebula (Bühler &
Blandford 2014). We verify that choosing Γ=1.5 or 2.5 does
not signiﬁcantly affect the conclusions.

Freezing the photon index effectively forces the cutoff PL to
dominate at higher energies. The cutoff energies and normal-
izations are left free and ﬁtted to all NuSTAR epochs. This ﬁt
focuses on higher energies and, therefore, we omit the RGS data
and instead freeze the coolest shock component. All nonthermal
components are harder than the average shape of the thermal
spectra. This
that any nonthermal contribution is
increasingly subdominant toward lower energies (e.g., Figures 6
and 10). Thus, the RGS data will not affect the hard nonthermal
components.

implies

Alp, Larsson, & Fransson

Importantly, the Fe abundance needs to be free in these ﬁts
but still constant across different epochs. This is necessary
because the Fe abundance was ﬁtted using the three-shock
model (Section 3.2), where the hottest component captured the
FeK line complex. With the hottest component replaced, the
Fe abundance will naturally need to increase. This is because
the cutoff PL dominates at those energies, and the line strength
is proportional to the abundance.

+1.8 0.6

We show a comparison of the three-shock model, continuous
temperature model, and two-shock plus cutoff PL model in
Figure 10. From the ﬁts of the cutoff PL model, we obtain an
average ﬁtted cutoff energy of 8keV and an Fe abundance of
+2.0 0.5
1.0 relative to the LMC Fe abundance. For reference, the
1.1 for Γ=1.5 and
corresponding Fe abundances are
2.0 for G = 2.5. Statistically, the goodness with the Γ=2
+2.5 0.8
cutoff PL is c = 2594
for 2778 DoF, compared to c = 2597
for 2771 DoF for the three-shock model. However, we consider
the Fe abundance to be unreasonably high (further discussed in
Section 5.3) and a strong indication that
the thermal
contribution around 6.5keV is underestimated using this
model. Furthermore, the ﬁts to different epochs result in cutoff
energies ranging from 2.4 to 13keV and normalizations
spanning a factor of 3. This is compensated by changes in the
best-ﬁt temperature of the warmer of the two shocks from 1.5
to 5.4keV. These factors all indicate that it is possible to
include a nonthermal component, but it is not statistically nor
physically motivated and adds unnecessary complexity to the
model. We note that we consider adding a cutoff PL as
introducing additional complexity because it is composed of a
qualitatively new component even though,
the
number of DoF is reduced from 2778 to 2771.5 Therefore,
we reject the model with the cutoff PL.

formally,

Another possibility is to simply add a nonthermal component
to the three-shock model. In this case, a cutoff energy cannot be
constrained, so we add a PL with Γ=2. We note that the Fe
abundance remains frozen to our adopted standard value of
0.62 of LMC because the hottest shock component still
dominates around 6.5keV. Fitting yields an improvement of
for 1 additional DoF (2770 DoF in total)
cD = -2.71
compared to the standard three-shock model. This means that
the PL results in a negligible improvement, and it
is not
motivated to include it.

2

To put a limit on the nonthermal emission, we start from the ﬁt
above with the additional PL component with Γ=2. By ﬁtting
simultaneously to all observations, we obtain one average upper
limit instead of an upper limit at each epoch. The upper limit is
computed by ﬁnding the PL normalization that results in an
relative to the best ﬁt (using the XSPEC
increase of cD = 7.740
task error). We take the ﬂux of the PL component with this new
normalization as a 3σ upper limit. The resulting limits are

These limits are clearly model dependent, as

further
discussed in Section 5.3. A very conservative, model-
independent limit is to consider the total ﬂuxes as upper limits
(Table 5), with the 10–24keV range likely being the most
relevant.

5 Each shock component has three free parameters, whereas the cutoff PL has
two as Γ is frozen, and the Fe abundance is free when ﬁtting the cutoff PL
model.

tions because SN1987A is not detected in this energy range,

for the compact object but, naturally, also applies to any other

the analysis of Boggs et al. (2015), but with the inclusion of our
new data.

Following the baseline case of Boggs et al. (2015), we tie
the ﬂuxes, energies, and widths of the two lines. This can be
done because the relative ﬂuxes (96.4 93.0) and energies

(78.32 keV 67.87 keV) are given by the relative yields and
transition energies,
respectively. The widths are simply
proportional to the energy. This implies that both lines are

5.1.1. Emission from the ER Clumps

Previous studies of

following.

the ER clumps have shown the

1. Optical and ultraviolet (UV) observations resolve the
hotspots in the ER and show slow, radiative shocks with
velocities up to ∼700
-
km s 1 into clumps with preshock
104 cm−3 (Pun et al. 2002;
densities of up to ´6
Gröningsson et al. 2008; Larsson et al. 2019).

2. There is a clear east–west asymmetry in the X-ray
emission (Frank et al. 2016; Cendes et al. 2018). The
X-ray emission below 2keV is stronger to the west and
follows the optical ER emission. This implies that the ER
clumps dominate the <2 keV X-ray ﬂux.

3. The inferred ER radii in optical and X-rays also indicate
that the <2 keV X-rays originate from the same region as
the optical ER (Frank et al. 2016; Larsson et al. 2019).
Furthermore, the <2 keV radius appears to separate into
two components after 6000days when divided at
0.8keV, with the <0.8 keV component expanding the
slowest.

4. Simulations of shock interactions with the ER clumps
reveal a complex picture (Borkowski et al. 1997; Pun
et al. 2002; Orlando et al. 2015, 2019). The interactions
clearly disrupt the clumps, disperse the clump material,
and produce both radiative and adiabatic shocks of
varying temperatures. The temperatures are expected to
range from ∼0.2 to 1keV depending on the shock
velocities, densities, and incidence angle.

In this paper, we have presented new light curves of the soft
X-ray emission (Figure 4). These are in line with previous
conclusions and further corroborate the hypothesis that the soft
X-ray emission is primarily produced in the ER clumps. Figure 4
shows that X-rays below 2keV have a similar evolution as optical
and there are indications that the 0.45–0.7keV light curve is more
strongly correlated with the optical emission than the 0.5–2keV
emission after 10,000 days. This may be explained as a result of
the cooling time (tcool) depending on the shock velocity (Vs) and
density (n) as

for shocks faster than 500
fraction of the X-rays above ∼2keV is expected to follow the

5.1.2. Emission from the Low-density Regions

In addition to studies indicating that the X-ray emission
below 2keV originates from the ER clumps, the X-rays above
2keV likely originate from a region of wider latitudinal extent
and lower density. This is primarily motivated by the following
arguments.

1. Already in 1997, HST observations revealed Lyα and Hα
emission extending to±30° above and below the ER
(Michael et al. 1998). Later, radio and X-ray observations
showed similar latitudinal extents (Ng et al. 2009, 2013;
Cendes et al. 2018). This is also consistent with VLT
observations, which show Hα emission extending

5. Discussion

5.1. Physical Interpretation of the Thermal Emission

Thermal shock models adequately describe the observed X-ray
spectra. We ﬁnd no indications of a nonthermal component in the
spectrum. Instead, we favor an interpretation where the low- and
mid-temperature components originate from the ER clumps, while
the high-temperature component
is produced in low-density
regions. The ER clumps could give rise to a range of temperatures
as a result of varying incident shock angles, hydrodynamic
disruption of the clumps, and a mix of radiative and adiabatic
shocks of varying temperatures. The low-density regions refer to
both the diffuse gas between the ER clumps and the high-latitude
H II region. This interpretation is motivated by a number of
independent simulations and observations across the electro-
magnetic spectrum. We present these points separately for the ER
clumps in Section 5.1.1 and low-density regions in Section 5.1.2,
before tying things together in Section 5.1.3.

in 2012
(Fransson et al. 2013). Later VLT observations continue
to show similar velocities (Larsson et al. 2019).

2. In contrast to the <2 keV X-rays, the asymmetries of the
>2 keV X-rays follow the radio torus and are brighter to
the east. The new optical emission beyond the ER is also
stronger to the east, indicating stronger interaction at high
latitudes in this direction (Larsson et al. 2019).

3. The inferred ER radii in radio and X-rays indicate that the
>2 keV X-ray and radio emission is produced by shocks
km s 1 (Frank et al. 2016;
with velocities of ∼3000
Cendes et al. 2018). We note that small discrepancies
between the X-ray and radio radii could be due to a
combination of limited spatial resolution, projection effects,
and overlap between different components (energies) in
X-rays.

4. X-ray emission from the fastest shocks moving in the
low-density regions are expected to produce a faint, broad
component in the line proﬁles. This could potentially
reveal
the relative contributions of different shock
velocities to the X-ray emission below 2keV. A 20%
contribution from a broad component corresponding to a
velocity of ∼9000
km s 1 has been reported by Dewey
et al. (2012), but the limited energy resolution and line
blending complicate analyses. The X-ray line proﬁles
have also been successfully ﬁtted without a broad
component (Zhekov et al. 2009). We do not investigate
the line proﬁles in detail but obtain good ﬁts using
models without
component.
However, optical and UV lines show directly that a
km s 1 component is present (Michael et al.
∼13,000
1998; Fransson et al. 2013). For these very fast shocks,
the slow equipartition between the electrons and ions
likely leads to a considerably lower electron than ion
temperature, which we discuss below.

We present the 3–8 and 10–24keV light curves to 2020 in
Figure 4. The 3–8keV X-ray light curve follows the radio light
curve relatively well. The 10–24keV light curve has a ﬂatter
evolution, but this is likely the effect of a slight decrease in
temperature (Figure 7), rather than an indication of a different
physical origin (Section 5.3). This shows that the X-ray light
curves agree with the picture painted by the previous,
independent observations.

5.1.3. The Combined Picture

The points above, along with further pieces of information,
form a combined picture. Assuming equipartition between
electrons and protons behind the shocks, the temperature is
related to the shock velocities by

with the temperature, one needs to assume that the emission in the
0.5–2keV band has contributions from both slower radiative
shocks, also emitting in the optical, and faster, adiabatic shocks
emitting mainly in X-rays. Deviations from equipartition could
also be contributing. This is primarily relevant for the hottest
component and is described in more detail below. We note
that Frank et al. (2016) ﬁnd an expansion velocity of -

Finally, to connect the higher velocities seen by Frank et al.
(2016) in the 2–10keV band to the 4keV component that we
ﬁnd, one has to assume only partial equipartition of the ion and
electron temperatures behind these faster shocks. Slow equilibra-
tion behind fast shocks has been inferred from supernova

In addition to the temperatures, the densities inferred from
the ﬁtted parameterized ionization age (Section 4.4) are
comparable to previous estimates. Based on optical data, the
densities of the unshocked ER clumps are estimated to reach
104 cm−3 (Pun et al. 2002; Gröningsson et al. 2008).
´6
Furthermore, modeling based on radio and optical data ﬁnds
densities of 103cm−3 in the diffuse ER (Mattila et al. 2010)
and a density of 102cm−3 in the surrounding H II region
(Chevalier & Dwarkadas 1995; Lundqvist 1999). Our estimates
are uncertain but capture the trend of a decreasing ionization
age as a function of increasing energy. This is an indication that
cooler, slower shocks originate from regions of higher density.
There are a number of observables that are not completely
explained by our model. We are unable to provide a natural
reason for why the temperature distribution produced by the
clumps would be bimodal. It could simply be that the apparent
bimodality is a smoother broad distribution in reality.
Furthermore, we assume that
the hottest component arises
from regions spanning a wide range of densities. Thus, it is
somewhat surprising that the temperature distribution shows
such a narrow peak around 4keV. A possibility is that the
relatively homogeneous H II region dominates this component.
However, given the complexity of the system, we believe
that these are minor issues. There are also signiﬁcant modeling
uncertainties underlying the shock model used for the analysis,
temperatures below ∼1keV where radiative
especially at
losses become important (Section 3.1). In addition, other
emission components, such as the reverse shock propagating
back into the ejecta, are predicted to contribute at some level at

the current epochs (Orlando et al. 2015, 2019). This is likely an
underlying component, which is absorbed into our three-
component interpretation.

The spectra from different epochs are relatively similar
except for a decrease in temperature of the hottest component
in the last epoch (Figure 7). The geometry is too complex for
detailed predictions of the temporal evolution. We simply note
that a slight decrease in temperature is physically reasonable
based on a general deceleration of the ejecta and the blast wave.
Therefore, a completely thermal interpretation of the spectrum
is consistent with the observed temporal evolution.

To summarize, the combination of all available information
implies that the X-ray emission likely is of purely thermal
origin. This emission would be produced by shocks with
typical temperatures of 0.3–0.9keV in the ER clumps and
4keV in the surrounding diffuse ER and H II region. However,
we conclude by cautioning not to overinterpret the data. This is
simply our favored simpliﬁcation of a clearly more complex
reality.

5.2. Previous Thermal Modeling

Our spectral analysis indicates the presence of three compo-
nents. Only a few previous analyses have used three shock
components (Zhekov et al. 2010; Dewey et al. 2012; Maggi et al.
2012). In contrast, most earlier studies found bimodal temperature
distributions (Zhekov et al. 2006, 2009; Dewey et al. 2008) or
used two shock components (Haberl et al. 2006; Heng et al. 2008;
Sturm et al. 2010; Park et al. 2011; Helder et al. 2013; Frank et al.
2016; Bray et al. 2020).

We provide a comparison of our ﬁtted temperatures with a
selection of literature values in Table 6. Our ﬁts ﬁnd higher

16

maximum temperatures than most other analyses, especially at
comparable epochs. Notably, even the previous analyses with
continuous temperature models only found two peaks. The
differences are primarily due to the wider energy range provided
by NuSTAR, which we show in Appendix D (Table D1).

Some previous ﬁts found comparable maximum tempera-
tures at epochs earlier than ∼7000 days, before the ER
interaction peak. This is likely because the continuum from the
surrounding low-density region was dominant even below
∼5keV, which is the range where other analyses are primarily
sensitive. In addition to the values in Table 6, Maggi et al.
(2012) mention that the hottest temperature is >3.5 keV in
XMM-Newton observations from 7000 to 9000 days, but they
did not present a complete spectral analysis. There appears to
be a trend that XMM-Newton data result in higher temperatures
than Chandra data,
likely due to the higher high-energy
sensitivity of XMM-Newton. This strengthens the argument
that NuSTAR data are required to more robustly ﬁt shock
components with temperatures above ∼3keV (see Appendix D
for further details).

5.3. Nonthermal Emission

it

remains possible that

Even though we favor a thermal interpretation of the X-ray
emission,
there is a nonthermal
contribution. In Section 4.5, we showed that a model where the
hottest shock component is replaced by a cutoff PL provides a ﬁt
of comparable quality to the purely thermal model. However, an
important feature for the interpretation of the X-ray spectrum is
the FeK line complex around 6.4–6.9keV (Figure 8).

The presence of a clear FeK line in the observed X-ray
spectrum implies that at least part of the hard X-ray emission is of

The Astrophysical Journal, 916:76 (30pp), 2021 August 1

thermal origin. The strength of the line predicted by the thermal
model is proportional to the ﬁtted Fe abundance. Therefore, in
principle, it is possible to accommodate an additional nonthermal
component by increasing the Fe abundances. This results in a
higher modeled thermal line-to-continuum ratio, which would
then need an additional nonthermal continuum component to
properly match the observed line-to-continuum ratio. Conse-
quently, the Fe abundance would be artiﬁcially suppressed if we
attempt to ﬁt a purely thermal model to a spectrum that has a
signiﬁcant fraction of nonthermal emission.

0.62 0.01

0.56 0.31

We ﬁnd that our best-ﬁt Fe abundance of 0.62 relative to the
LMC (Table 4) provides adequate ﬁts to the FeK line
(Figure 8; see also Sturm et al. 2010; Maggi et al. 2012). We

on optical spectroscopy (Mattila et al. 2010). If there is a
signiﬁcant nonthermal contribution, we expect a substantially
lower ﬁtted Fe abundance.

The correlation between the 3–8keV and radio light curves
(Figure 4) could be interpreted as a suggestion that (part of) the
hard X-rays are nonthermal. However, the 10–24keV light
curve rises much more slowly than the 3–8keV light curve.
This is opposite to what would naively be expected if the hard
X-rays are of nonthermal origin. The 10–24keV ﬂux would be
expected to increase faster because thermal X-rays would
contribute more to the 3–8keV than the 10–24keV range in
relative terms. In this scenario, it is implicitly assumed that the
thermal ﬂux would not increase as fast as the radio ﬂux, based
on comparisons between radio and soft X-rays. Because the
10–24keV ﬂux increases more slowly than 3–8keV, a
nonthermal model would need to have a contrived spectral
evolution, which we disfavor against a simple, slight decrease
in maximum temperature in a completely thermal model.
Following the above arguments, we conclude that

the
evidence for a nonthermal component is weak. Instead, we
use the data to compute upper limits (Sections 4.5 and 4.6) as
constraints on a nonthermal component. These limits constrain
cosmic-ray acceleration and the properties of the compact
object, as discussed below.

5.4. Cosmic-Ray Acceleration

The shocks from the CSM interactions around SN1987A are
expected to accelerate relativistic particles (Berezhko et al.
2011, 2015; Dwarkadas 2013). The relativistic electrons from this
acceleration process are thought to produce the observed radio
emission and it is possible that the same nonthermal synchrotron
component extends
to X-ray energies. From a theoretical
perspective, Berezhko et al. (2015) present a prediction for the
nonthermal X-ray contribution associated with cosmic-ray accel-
eration. Using their model for cosmic-ray acceleration (Berezhko &
Ksenofontov 2000, 2006), they ﬁnd a peak 35–65keV ﬂux of ´5

Recently, it has been reported that a brightening GeV source
has been detected by Fermi/LAT, possibly associated with
SN1987A (Malyshev et al. 2019; Petruk et al. 2019). The GeV

emission could be of either hadronic or leptonic origin. In the
hadronic scenario, accelerated protons interact with protons in
the ISM and produce neutral pions, which decay into gamma-
rays. On the other hand, a leptonic origin implies relativistic
bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton scattering by accelerated
electrons. The scenario that most directly affects the observed
X-ray emission is if the GeV emission is leptonic and a
signiﬁcant part of the X-ray emission is nonthermal. In this
case, a steep rise in the GeV emission would be correlated with
a more rapid increase in the (hard) X-ray light curve due to an
increasing nonthermal component.

The observed GeV light curve increases by at least a factor
of 2 between 2012 and 2018 (Malyshev et al. 2019; Petruk
et al. 2019). This time range roughly coincides with the ﬁrst
and last NuSTAR observation. Both the X-ray and radio light
curves continue to smoothly increase at steady rates by factors
of ∼1.5 over this time interval (Figure 4). Notably, the high-
energy X-ray component above 10keV is the ﬂattest and
barely increases during this time. Therefore, we conclude that
there is no obvious correlation between any part of the X-ray or
radio light curve with the GeV increase. This indicates that the
GeV emission is of hadronic origin or unrelated to SN1987A.

5.5. Limits on the Compact Object

The upper limit on a nonthermal component in the NuSTAR
data places new constraints on the compact object at hard X-ray
energies and complements the multiwavelength limits pre-
sented in Alp et al. (2018b). Currently,
the only tentative
indication of a neutron star is the bright spot observed in a
679GHz ALMA image (Cigan et al. 2019). This could
potentially be the result of local dust heating by thermal
emission from a neutron star, as suggested in Alp et al.
(2018b). A PWN can also match the observation, but this
model is practically unconstrained and can ﬁt almost any data.
Therefore, we ﬁnd no reason to favor the PWN model over
passive thermal neutron star heating. However, we stress that
the conclusions from the ALMA image are uncertain due to a
low S/B, possible structure in the underlying dust emission,
and poorly constrained spectrum and luminosity of the possible
source. More data are needed to clarify the nature of the ALMA
hotspot.

Recently, Greco et al. (2021) interpreted the 2012–2014
NuSTAR data as indications of a PWN and rejected a purely
thermal interpretation of the data. This is in stark contrast to our
results. As we show in Section 4.5, we are unable to motivate a
model with a nonthermal component.

We also search for pulsed emission between 10 and 20keV
(Appendix A), which could be present
if a PWN is
contributing. No pulsations are detected, and the pulsed
fraction is constrained to less than 15% of the total source
ﬂux between 10 and 20keV.

Adding a PWN component to a thermal model will, of course,

Finally, any proposed model for the compact object

in
SN1987A must
form a coherent physical picture with
observations at other wavelengths and the total energy budget
of the system. Due to the excellent observational coverage, the
allowed bolometric luminosity of the neutron star is con-
strained to be lower than 10–100 L (Alp et al. 2018b). The
quoted luminosity interval accounts for the uncertainty in the
amount of newly formed dust in the ejecta along the line of
sight.

Our 35–65keV ﬂux limit provides the deepest constraints on
any X-ray emission from a compact object in SN1987A. X-ray
emission from the compact object is affected by absorption
because it resides close to the center of the ejecta (Alp et al.
2018a). The high metallicity of the SN ejecta results in
photoabsorption dominating up to ∼30keV. This implies that
the cross section above 30keV is dominated by Compton
scattering and that the opacity at these energies is many orders
of magnitudes lower than in the 0.3–10keV band. We estimate
the 35–65keV absorption using a three-dimensional neutrino-
driven SN explosion model (Alp et al. 2018a), speciﬁcally the
B15 model from Wongwathanarat et al. (2015). This is the
same absorption model as was used for SN1987A by Alp et al.
(2018b). We ﬁnd that approximately 5% of the 35–65keV ﬂux
is expected to be absorbed at 10,000 days, which we henceforth
correct for. For reference, the optical depth to the center of the
ejecta at current epochs is ∼100 at 1keV, ∼3 at 5keV, and
∼0.03 at 50keV (Alp et al. 2018a).

The absorption-corrected 35–65keV limit

is ´ -
10 14
ergs−1cm−2 (Section 4.6) and corresponds to approximately
1034ergs−1 (7 L ) for a distance of 51.2kpc. This is
´2
equivalent to a fraction of ∼0.05 of the Crab Pulsar (excluding
the Nebula; Bühler & Blandford 2014) and is the most
constraining direct limit on a Crab Pulsar-like spectrum. This is
deeper
than previous hard X-ray limits but does not
qualitatively affect any conclusions in Alp et al. (2018b).

6. Summary and Conclusions

We have studied new NuSTAR observations of SN1987A
obtained in 2020 and performed a combined analysis with
archival NuSTAR data from 2012 to 2014 and XMM-Newton
data from 2000 to 2019. This combination covers a wide X-ray
interval ranging from 0.45 to 78keV. In conjunction with the
long temporal baseline, it provides a unique X-ray view of the
complex SN1987A system.

The X-ray light curves in different energy bands have
evolved signiﬁcantly over the past few epochs. The 10–24keV
ﬂux remained practically constant between 9300 and
12,000days (2012–2020). In contrast, the 3–8keV ﬂux was
rising but has tentatively started to ﬂatten after 11,000days
(2017). Previously published radio light curves only extend to
10,942days (2017; Cendes et al. 2018), but followed the rising
phase of the 3–8keV emission up to that point. The 0.5–2keV
emission has clearly decreased since 10,000days (2015). In
particular, we ﬁnd that the correlation between optical and
X-rays is increasingly strong for decreasing X-ray energies.

We favor a purely thermal description of the X-ray spectra.
Acceptable ﬁts require three shocked plasma components at
temperatures of approximately 0.3, 0.9, and 4keV. We obtain
very similar
results using a model with a continuous
temperature distribution. Previous studies have mostly used

18

two components with temperatures of approximately 0.5 and
2.5keV. The difference is most likely due to the extended
energy range offered by NuSTAR, which has not been used for
ﬁts of purely thermal spectra in previous studies.

Our favored interpretation associates the 0.3 and 0.9keV
components with the dense ER clumps, whereas the 4keV
emission originates from the diffuse ER gas and the high-
latitude H II region. There is no obvious explanation for why
the ER clumps would produce emission at
two distinct
temperatures. The bimodality between the 0.3 and 0.9keV
components is, however, uncertain and could be the manifesta-
tion of a smoother broad distribution.

We ﬁnd no evidence for a nonthermal contribution to the
X-ray data, neither from the temporal nor spectral analysis. The
10–24keV ﬂux does not follow the synchrotron radio light
curve, which would be the most natural expectation if the X-ray
emission is increasingly dominated by synchrotron emission
from shock-accelerated electrons at higher energies. The
spectral ﬁts do not improve when a PL is added, and the clear
FeK line complex is also well captured by a purely thermal
model. Replacing the hottest
thermal component with a
nonthermal component results in a statistically acceptable ﬁt
but requires an unreasonably high Fe abundance. Furthermore,
the thermal
interpretation forms a consistent picture with
temporal, spectral, and spatial multiwavelength information
from the literature. However, we note that this does not ﬁrmly
exclude a, possibly weak, nonthermal contribution.

A brightening of SN1987A at GeV energies has recently been
reported (Malyshev et al. 2019; Petruk et al. 2019). We ﬁnd no
clear correlation between the GeV and X-ray emission. This
indicates that
the GeV emission is dominated by hadronic
processes or unrelated to SN1987A. However, in the leptonic
scenario, predictions for the level of X-ray emission and the high-
energy synchrotron cooling cutoff are both uncertain. This leaves
the leptonic channel possible but requires it
to be consistent
10 14ergs−1cm−2
with the observational upper limits ( ´ -
10 14ergs−1cm−2 from 35 to
from 10 to 24keV and ´ -
65keV).

Even if a faint nonthermal component is present, it is more
likely to be shock-accelerated synchrotron emission or the
high-energy tail of a free–free component. We also constrain
the pulsed fraction of the 10–20keV ﬂux to be less than 15%
(Appendix A).

The NuSTAR data constrain the 35–65keV luminosity
of the compact object in SN1987A to be lower than ´2
1034ergs−1 (7 L ; ´ -
10 14ergs−1cm−2). We put this into
context by comparing the limit with previous multiwavelength
observations. These show that the bolometric luminosity of the
compact object must be lower than 10–100 L (range due to
uncertain properties of the dust). Currently, an ALMA image at
679GHz is the only tentative hint of a neutron star
in
SN1987A, which needs to be veriﬁed with higher quality data.
Our analysis shows that NuSTAR observations are required
for a complete X-ray view of SN1987A. NuSTAR is the only
instrument sensitive enough to detect the X-ray continuum
above 10keV, which affects the interpretation of the entire
X-ray spectrum. The optical depth to the compact object is
currently ∼1 at 10keV, which implies that practically no
X-rays of lower energy escape unless clumping is stronger than
simulations indicate. This means that NuSTAR could be the
most sensitive telescope to search for X-ray emission from a
potential neutron star. If the GeV emission keeps increasing, it
is also possible that a nonthermal component will emerge in the
NuSTAR range. Future NuSTAR observations of SN1987A
are therefore critical to complement the regular monitoring at
other wavelengths.

Search for Pulsed Emission

We search for pulsed X-ray emission from SN1987A as this
would be the smoking gun of a pulsar. For this timing analysis,
we use the observations from 2012 to 2014 (all NuSTAR
epochs except for the last). Restricting the temporal baseline to
two years improves the sensitivity. A number of
factors
contribute to this. First, a shorter temporal baseline requires a
lower resolution in rotational period because period errors
propagate proportionally to the baseline. Second, a lower
resolution in the pulsar spin-down rate is required because this
also propagates into the phase solution. Furthermore, limiting
the time range to two years reduces the risk of including more
complex phenomena not
included in the modeled phase
solution, such as nonlinear spin evolution or discrete glitches.
Finally, including the 2020 data only increases the total number
of photons by <10%.

Before performing a detailed search for pulsed emission, we
visually inspect the light curves. The light curve from the 2013
June 29 observation is shown in Figure A1 as an example (the
other light curves are similar). There are no indications of
variability within individual observations. A priori, a detection
is also unlikely given our favored model for SN1987A and
limited data quality. However, a rigorous search for pulsed
emission is motivated by the importance of a potential
detection and the fact that the expected spin period cannot be
probed visually.

A.1. Data Reduction

the events

The reduction of this data was performed separately and used
the latest software at an earlier time of analysis, speciﬁcally
NuSTARDAS 1.8.0 and CALDB version 20180126. We
transform the timestamps of
to Barycentric
Dynamical Time (TDB) at the solar system barycenter using
the task barycorr (for an overview of measures of time, see
Eastman et al. 2010), with JPL Planetary Ephemeris DE-405.
We combine the data from the FPMA and FPMB modules
and restrict the energy range to 10–20keV. Below 10keV,
Chandra images clearly show that
the ER dominates. The
optical depth through the ejecta is also very high below 10keV
(Section 5.5). The upper 20keV limit is imposed to optimize
the S/B.

We extract source photons from a circular region with a
radius of 75″ pixels, which optimizes the signal-to-noise ratio.
No background sample is necessary for the timing analysis.
The source region contains a total of 22,381 events, and the
number of source events is estimated to be ∼10,000, assuming
a spatially uniform background.

A.2. Timing Analysis

Overall, our timing method is similar to that of the Fermi
pulsar search Einstein@Home (Clark et al. 2017). Here, we
provide an overview of the method and motivate the choice of
parameters.

The source extraction radius of 75″ is relatively large
compared to the 18″ FWHM of the telescope, which implies
that a large number of background events are included. This is
not an issue because we assign a weight to each event based on
the likelihood that it is produced by SN1987A (Bickel et al.
2008; Kerr 2011). The likelihood is computed by considering

the position of the event, the background level, and the known
point-spread function of the telescope.

To test the signiﬁcance of pulsed emission, we use the H-test
introduced by de Jager et al. (1989). The test is named after
Hart (1985) and belongs to the class of tests for uniformity on
the circle (Rayleigh 2020; Beran 1969). The H-test is designed
to be powerful for typical, general pulsar pulse proﬁles, which
is useful when the pulse proﬁle is unknown. The null
cumulative distribution function for the H-statistic is accurately
known from simulations (de Jager & Büsching 2010). The H-
statistic from different observations can be summed incoher-
ently, and its approximate null distribution is also known (de
Jager & Büsching 2010).

To reduce computational complexity, we divide the total
exposure of 2.8Ms into 32 time intervals with an average
exposure of 90ks. A search is performed on each interval
separately, and the test statistics are then combined incoher-
ently. The incoherent summing over long timescales is possible
because the timing accuracy of NuSTAR is stable to within ∼2
ms (Madsen et al. 2015; see Bachetti et al. 2021 for a recent
signiﬁcant improvement to <100 μs).
The neutron star spin is characterized by the period (P) and
spin-down rate ( P). We search all periods from 30ms to 1ks.
For reference, the temporal resolution of NuSTAR is 3ms
(Madsen et al. 2015), and the deadtime per event is 2.5ms
(Bachetti et al. 2015; Bachetti & Huppenkothen 2018).
For each P, we search P from 0 to a maximum limit on P.
This limit is either set by the spin-down luminosity (L) or the
spin-down age (tsd), depending on which is more constraining
for a given P. The spin-down is related to the luminosity by

adopt parameter values of L=10,000 L , M=1.4

R=12km (Özel & Freire 2016). This spin-down luminosity
is much higher than the bolometric limit on the order of 100 L
(Alp et al. 2018b), but
the spin-down luminosity could
potentially be much higher than the bolometric luminosity
(Abdo et al. 2013; Caraveo 2014).

A.3. Results

We detect no pulsed emission from SN1987A and verify
that the observed HT distribution is consistent with the null
distribution. Instead, we put a constraint on the pulsed fraction
of the emission in the 10–20keV range. We compute the limit
by simulating a pulsed signal. The signal is modeled by a single
Gaussian with a duty cycle of 20% (FWHM).

Assuming the 10–20keV emission to be from a PWN, the 3σ
upper limit on the source pulsed fraction is 15% (background
subtracted). Importantly, however, the 10–20keV range certainly
includes photons from ER interactions. This implies that the upper
limit on the pulsed fraction of the compact object emission is less
constraining than 15%. For example, if the thermal-to-PWN ﬂux
ratio is >7,
the pulsed fraction is completely unconstrained
because a 100% pulsed fraction would go undetected.

line is absorbed by the ejecta to a varying degree
sensitively depending on the spatial Mn
distribution. The
amount of absorption is modeled by an average “effective” optical
depth. At the relevant epochs, only the outermost Mn
on the
near side is observable (Alp et al. 2018a, 2019). Therefore,
dedicated detailed computations are necessary to estimate the
amount of absorption. Leising (2006) estimated the amount of
absorption of the 5.9keV line by the ejecta using the 10HMM SN
model (Pinto & Woosley 1988). This model is one-dimensional
and has additional mixing introduced by hand. It was designed to
successfully match many observables
in
particular the X-ray and gamma-ray properties during the ﬁrst
few years (Alp et al. 2019). At the relevant epochs, the effective
optical depth is ∼1.2 at 5.9keV for the modeled Fe55
distribution.
Combining this with the ﬂux limit results in a 3σ upper limit on
the initial Fe55 mass of

unable to draw a ﬁrm conclusion. If astrophysical, the ﬂux
would point toward an initial Fe55 mass of

We stress that the interval is a purely statistical 1σ interval.
Systematic uncertainties are certainly also signiﬁcant, particu-

Systematic Uncertainties

The calibration of X-ray instruments is known to be slightly
inaccurate with errors of approximately 5%–10% (Plucinsky
et al. 2008, 2017; Ishida et al. 2011; Madsen et al. 2017a). In
general, the calibration errors are energy dependent, implying
that spectral shapes are affected in addition to the overall
normalization. We introduce free constants between different
instruments when ﬁtting simultaneously, which capture overall
normalization errors. This approach does not address the
energy dependence but is still conventionally used in X-ray
analyses.

The calibrations are known to be variable and depend on
epoch, observing conditions, and underlying spectrum. There-
fore, we investigate the spectral difference between NuSTAR
and XMM-Newton/pn using our data. We do this by ﬁtting a
simpliﬁed version of the thermal shock model. This model is
the same as the standard model but with only one shock
component. This is sufﬁcient because we only perform the
comparison in a reduced energy range from 3 to 8keV. To
quantify the calibration differences, the temperature of this
single component is untied between NuSTAR and pn (with τ
and the EM remaining tied).

We ﬁt this model to all epochs and provide the resulting
temperatures and ﬁt statistics in Table C1. The average
NuSTAR temperature (k TB AB) is 2.79keV compared with the
average pn temperature (k TB pn) of 2.39keV. This difference is
clearly systematic as all TAB are signiﬁcantly higher than Tpn.
When the temperatures are tied, the average cross-normal-
ization between NuSTAR (CAB) and pn (Cpn) is
=C0.88 pn
CAB. The corresponding factor is 0.71 when the temperatures
are untied. Consequently, the absolute magnitude difference
between NuSTAR and pn is approximately 0.88. The
remaining difference when the temperatures are untied is
primarily due to the connection between the temperature and
the EM. This shows that both the normalization and spectral
shapes are different between NuSTAR and pn.

Table C1 also shows the improvement

in ﬁt statistics
obtained by untying the NuSTAR and pn temperatures
compared with tying the temperatures. The average difference

at each epoch of
differences are signiﬁcant. This value is only computed from

results to other epochs, which implies that

Due to the calibration uncertainties, we omit the pn data
from the detailed spectral analysis to avoid biases. We motivate
this further and explore the effects of including pn data and a
number of other choices
for managing the calibration
uncertainties in detail in Appendix D below. Finally, we also
note that the pn data are corrected for modest levels of pileup
(Section 2.2), which could affect the accuracy.

In addition to the systematic differences between NuSTAR
and pn, the analysis is also affected by calibration uncertainties
between pn and RGS at low energies. The differences between
these instruments have previously been studied by dedicated
calibration programs (Plucinsky et al. 2008, 2017). Small
differences are clearly visible in the observations of SN1987A
(see Figures in Appendix D), but
these cannot be easily
modeled due to the more complex spectrum at low energies. A
simpliﬁed method of avoiding part of the problem is to raise the
lower limit of the pn energy range slightly. We choose 0.8keV
as a trade-off between using as much data as possible and
introducing calibration tensions into the ﬁts.

In addition to the instrumental calibration errors, there are
systematics introduced by the data reduction and methods. For
example, Frank et al. (2016) also analyzed the XMM-Newton
observations up to 10,141 days. We ﬁnd better agreement
within a few percent at 0.5–2keV and at earlier epochs (around
8000 days), but up to 10% higher 3–8keV ﬂuxes at later times.
There is a large number of factors that could contribute to these
differences: source and background regions, data calibration
version, choice of underlying model, free parameters, ISM and
model abundances, amount of absorption, cross sections, and
pileup corrections.

For these reasons, we add a systematic uncertainty to our
X-ray ﬂuxes. This is added in quadrature to the systematic error
in Figure 4, but we report both separately in tables. We adopt a
ﬁducial systematic uncertainty of 8% (of the total ﬂux), which
we believe is a reasonable estimate. This particular value is the
typical difference we ﬁnd in our comparisons between
independent analyses. It also agrees with cross-calibration
programs between different instruments (e.g., Madsen et al.
2017a; Plucinsky et al. 2017). We do not rely on this value for
any quantitative analysis. The purpose is solely to serve as a
reminder of the systematics, which are often left implicit.

Finally, we note that

these systematics only apply to
comparisons between parameters from different instruments,
data reductions, or methods. The systematic errors are likely
signiﬁcantly lower for analyses of homogeneously estimated
parameter values. Importantly,
the ﬂuxes

Alternative Setups for the Spectral Analysis

Appendix D

In this section, we explore different possibilities for handling
the cross-calibration uncertainties in the spectral analysis. We
try different spectral models, treatments of instrument differ-
ences, and data sets. A summary is provided in Table D1, and
the ﬁts are described below. Importantly, even though the best-
ﬁt values are slightly different, our main conclusions remain
unchanged regardless of how the data are analyzed.

D.1. Models Used for Comparisons

The models we present here are the standard model with
three shocks and a simpliﬁed version with only two shock
components. We ﬁt this model to RGS, pn, and NuSTAR data
simultaneously as well as separately to data from only two of
the instruments. This leads to four possible setups for each of
the models. All parameters apart from constant cross-normal-
ization factors are tied between the instruments in these ﬁts.
The ﬁtted energy ranges are the same as presented in Section 3.

the different shock components in order of increasing temperature, identiﬁed by the subscripts. The last model has different NuSTAR and XMM-Newton temperatures
for the hottest component. The NuSTAR temperature is T3, whereas the XMM-Newton temperature is TX. The statistical errors (not shown) for the temperatures vary
by approximately a factor of 2 for the different setups. More data generally reduce the uncertainties and the different data sets naturally primarily affect the
components within the energy ranges of the instruments.

In addition to the ﬁts with two and three shock components,
we investigate a variation of the three-shock model. For this
model, the temperatures of the hottest component are coupled

3, where T3 is the NuSTAR temperature and TX is
the XMM-Newton temperature. The factor of 0.88 is obtained
from the ﬁt to the overlapping 3–8keV region of the third
epoch at 9424days (Table C1). This version of the model with
different temperatures for the hottest components is only ﬁtted
to RGS, pn, and NuSTAR data simultaneously.

There are a number of other possible variations for
connecting the NuSTAR and pn data. In addition to the ﬁts
presented below, we have explored constraining the cross-
normalizations, completely decoupling the temperatures, and
additionally untying the EMs of the hottest components. The
trend is naturally that gradually increasing the amount of
freedom improves the ﬁt quality, but the results are similar for
all setups.

D.2. Results

The ﬁt statistics and temperatures of the above setups are
provided in Table D1. We present the ﬁt statistics to all data
combined, the average temperatures, and the goodness of ﬁts to
the third epoch (9424 days; NuSTAR and XMM-Newton are
separated by one day). We also show ﬁts of four of the models
in Figure D1 where the models are identiﬁed by Roman
numerals (see Table D1).

First, we compare ModelsI andII. These are the models
with two and three shock components, respectively, that are
ﬁtted to data from NuSTAR, RGS, and pn. It is clear that two
components (Model I) are insufﬁcient to model the combined

results in a substantial improvement in the goodness of ﬁt.

the inferior ﬁt using two components is primarily driven by the
<2 keV range, as can be seen in Figure D1. This is also clear
from the temperatures of the two cooler components of the
three-shock model. Both cool components have temperatures

addition of a third component does not signiﬁcantly change the
broadband model continuum shape. This implies that conclu-
sions regarding the continuum are relatively independent of the
third shock component. However, a third component is clearly
motivated by the statistical
improvement. We note that
improved ﬁts can be achieved by allowing for more freedom
by freeing the constant parameters (Section 3.2) or more
conservative data-ﬁltering criteria (which reduces the number
of photons; e.g., Sun et al. 2021), but exploring all
these
possibilities are not within the current scope.

Figure D1 subﬁgure II can also be compared with subﬁgure III.
Both use the same standard three-shock model. The difference
between these models is that ModelII is ﬁtted to all data, whereas
ModelIII is ﬁtted to NuSTAR and RGS data. We note that
ModelIII is the primary standard model used for the main
analysis. The pn data in subﬁgure III have been overplotted and
only rescaled by a factor of 0.95 to minimize the residuals. It is
clear from the residuals that there are systematic offsets between
the NuSTAR and pn data (as quantiﬁed in Appendix C above).
This is especially clear in the overlapping region. Furthermore, the
pn data are in excess of the model in the 3keV region, which is a
consequence of the differences in spectral slope. The conse-
quences of these difference can be seen in the residuals of
subﬁgure II and the worse ﬁt statistic.

The rescaling of temperatures alleviates a signiﬁcant part of the

andIV, introducing the pn data to the ﬁts introduces 1005 DoF

from 0.3keV, but only 0.8–10keV data are used for the analysis throughout the paper.

In addition to the decrease in overall ﬁt quality for
ModelIV, the average cross-normalization constant between
the NuSTAR and XMM-Newton data is 0.82. These ﬁts use
the three-shock model, but NuSTAR is quite insensitive to the
two cooler components. This means that the EM of the hottest
component is degenerate with the cross-normalization con-
stant, which implies that the connection between the NuSTAR
and pn data is relatively weak. Consequently,
the hottest
shock components are largely decoupled between NuSTAR
and pn, which partly defeats the purpose of including the pn
data. In light of this, we conclude that adding the pn data
worsens the ﬁt quality,
introduces biases, and adds little

information because the components are required to be
relatively uncoupled.

Despite the above arguments, including pn data remains a
possible alternative. In principle, it is possible that the pn data
are more accurate than NuSTAR data. However, the incon-
sistencies in the overlapping region between NuSTAR and pn
show that
there must be signiﬁcant calibration errors. The
excess above 10keV in NuSTAR, which is more pronounced
when pn data are included, cannot be a result of instrumental
calibration because the ratio between the data and model is
much higher than 10%. It is possible that the ﬁt attempts to
capture calibration inconsistencies at the expense of producing

24

The Astrophysical Journal, 916:76 (30pp), 2021 August 1

Alp, Larsson, & Fransson

Figure D1. (Continued.)

an artiﬁcial excess above 10keV. This could happen if both the
instrumental
inconsistencies and artiﬁcial excess are of
comparable statistical signiﬁcance.

Importantly, including pn data does not affect the scientiﬁc
conclusions qualitatively. The pn data lower the temperature of
the hottest component from ∼4 to ∼3–3.4keV. Naturally, this
leads to an increased excess in the NuSTAR data above 10keV.
This does not imply that the origin of such an excess is physically
different. Even in this case, we argue that it most likely is the
hottest part of the thermal emission. Simply adding a fourth
thermal component to the model does not provide stable ﬁts as the
temperatures vary irregularly across epochs. We note that the
continuous temperature model has sufﬁcient freedom to allow for
a broader temperature distribution. This model ﬁts the data well
and is discussed in Appendix D.3 below.

25

Instead, to characterize the shapes of the NuSTAR spectra,
we ﬁt a two-shock model to all NuSTAR epochs with no
other data sets. The ﬁtted temperatures are 1.8±0.3 and
5.9±0.7keV (these intervals are standard deviations among
the eight epochs) with a total ﬁt statistic of c = 2599
for 2771
DoF. We also inspect the residuals and ﬁnd that the ﬁts are very
good. This shows that the NuSTAR spectra can be well ﬁtted
with a thermal model with temperatures up to ∼6keV.
Temperatures around 6keV are not unreasonably high because
a faint, hot component with temperatures of up to 20–49keV is
expected from the reverse shock (Section 5.1.3).

2

Moreover, in Section 4.5, we show that the NuSTAR data
alone do not favor the inclusion of an additional PL component,
implying that thermal models are fully sufﬁcient to model the
NuSTAR data. This mean that
there is no support for two

Only four epochs are shown for visual clarity but the remaining epochs show similar behaviors. Upper-right panel: NuSTAR (blue), RGS (orange), pn (green), and the

minimize the residuals. Lower panel: same as upper right but also ﬁtted to the pn data. The upper-right ﬁt corresponds to the solid orange line in the upper-left plot,
whereas the lower-panel ﬁt corresponds to the dashed orange line. As in Figure D1, the pn data are shown from 0.3keV, but only 0.8–10keV data are used for the
analysis throughout the paper.

physically distinct components based on the NuSTAR data alone.
Therefore, it seems more likely that an excess, which is more
signiﬁcant when pn data are included, is a result of calibration
uncertainties or a high-energy tail of the thermal distribution.
Based on the above discussion, we favor excluding the pn data
from the spectral analysis, while noting that including the pn data
would not affect the conclusions qualitatively.

D.3. Implication of Adding pn Data for the Continuous Model

It

is also illuminating to explore ﬁts of the continuous
in addition to the discrete temperature

temperature model

models above. We show the results of ﬁts of the continuous
temperature model
to RGS, pn, and NuSTAR data in
Figure D2. Only a cross-normalization constant is allowed to
vary between the instruments (standard setup). The results are
qualitatively similar to ﬁts without the pn data and primarily
show a well-separated high-temperature peak and a broader,
possibly bimodal, peak below 2keV. The differences are
expected due to the large amount of freedom in the ﬁts and the
amount of data added by pn. This further strengthens the
argument
the
conclusions.

the pn data do not qualitatively affect

that

26

The Astrophysical Journal, 916:76 (30pp), 2021 August 1

Figure D2 also shows spectra and residuals of the continuous
model for the third epoch at 9424 days. We show ﬁts both with
and without the pn data. The temperature distributions for these
models both show contributions up to approximately 5keV,
above which the distributions quickly decline. It is clear that an
excellent ﬁt can be achieved using the continuous model when
pn data are not included. In particular, we note that the slight
excess visible above 10keV is well captured when the model
includes a faint temperature tail to ∼6keV.

The ﬁt including the pn data is also relatively good. It is
evident that the main issues for this ﬁt are the tensions between
the instruments, as can be seen in the overlapping regions. This
can also be seen in the ﬁt statistics. When pn data are included,
the ﬁt statistic for the third epoch increases by 267 for 126
DoF, for a total increase of 1954 for 1005 DoF across all
epochs. Despite the tensions,
is reasonable and the

the ﬁt

resulting temperature distribution is very similar to when pn
data are excluded.

This further corroborates the conclusion that a purely
thermal model is sufﬁcient. Of course, the investigations above
do not prove that other components are excluded. They only
show that additional components are not necessary.

XMM-Newton Fluxes

We provide ﬂuxes in four energy bands for all XMM-
Newton observations in Table E1. These ﬂuxes, except for the
full 0.5-8keV ﬂux, are plotted in Figure 4. The 0.45–0.7keV
range is dominated by the strong N VII Lyα (0.5003 keV) and
O VIII Lyα (0.6537 keV) lines. In the literature, 0.5–2keV is
commonly referred to as the “soft” band, while 3–8keV is the
“hard” band.

Appendix F

Best-ﬁt Parameters

Table F1 provides all best-ﬁt parameters for ﬁts using the
(Sections 3.1 and 4.2). The
standard three-shock model
temperatures are shown in Figure 7. We note that all t2 and
the last-epoch t1 only have lower limits. There also appears to
be slight degeneracies between τ and EM between different
shock components, which can be seen by the difference at
12,140days relative to the other epochs. However,
the

decrease in T3 in the last epoch appears robust. This is
supported by the light curves, hardness ratios, and continuous
model ﬁts.

In Table F2, we provide the observed (absorbed) ﬂuxes of
the individual components and goodness-of-ﬁt measures. These
ﬂuxes are the bolometric ﬂuxes of the components. Conse-
quently, they are much more uncertain than the ﬂuxes in energy
bands (Table 5) because the component ﬂuxes are more
sensitive to the underlying model.
