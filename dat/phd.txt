Abstract

A core-collapse supernova (CCSN) is an astronomical explosion that indi-
cates the death of a massive star. From observations, it is clear that a large
fraction of all massive stars undergoes supernova (SN) explosions, but de-
scribing how SNe explode has remained a challenge for many decades. A
key piece of the puzzle is the properties of the progenitor star.

The attached papers focus on comparing theoretical predictions with ob-
servations, primarily observations of SN 1987A. It is the closest observed SN
in more than four centuries, allowing for more detailed studies than for any
other SN. The papers investigate diﬀerent aspects of the SN phenomenon.
These individual studies are observationally diverse, but all attempt to an-
swer diﬀerent questions that are important for our understanding of the SN
process.

The properties of the progenitor star set the stage for the SN. Paper III
compares SN models based on diﬀerent progenitor stars with early X-ray
and gamma-ray observations of SN 1987A. The results help constrain the
evolution of the progenitor. In Paper IV, we searched for SN shock break-
outs (SBOs), which are the ﬁrst electromagnetic signals from CCSNe. The
discovered candidates convey information about the progenitors, test the
SBO theory, and indicate the presence of other types of X-ray transients.

The SN explosion mechanism itself is also integral to the analysis in
Paper III. The explosion models used in Paper III rely on some of the
most recent three-dimensional neutrino-driven SN models. The results lend
further support to the hypothesis that delayed neutrino heating is suﬃcient
to explode the vast majority of all CCSNe.

Much can also be learned about SNe by studying their remnants. The
remains of the core, the compact remnant, in SN 1987A has not yet been
detected. We have investigated how a compact object can remain hidden in
the ejecta in Paper I, using an absorption model from Paper II. We favor a
scenario where the compact object is a neutron star that is quiescent, dust-
obscured, and only emitting thermal emission. Paper V is another study of
SN 1987A, but focuses on the X-ray emission from the ongoing interactions

between the ejecta and circumstellar medium (CSM). The X-ray emission is
primarily generated by thermal processes in shocks produced by collisions
between the ejecta and the CSM. We found no evidence for any contribution
from relativistic particles or a neutron star.

Our description of CCSNe continues to improve but many questions
remain unanswered. Future observations will further our knowledge and
the models we have studied can be used for continued analyses. The next
generation of X-ray missions is very promising and a Galactic SN, which
would greatly accelerate the entire research ﬁeld, could occur at any time.

Introduction

Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are the violent deaths of massive stars.
They are extremely energetic and can shine as brightly as ten billion Suns.
CCSN explosions are only triggered in stars that are at least around ten
times more massive than the Sun. The driving mechanism that disrupts
the stars is only active for around one second, but supernovae (SNe) trap
this energy and shine brightly for several months. The remaining energy
is dissipated in the subsequent SN remnant (SNR) phase, which can be
slowly fading for thousands of years. Each CCSN explosion creates either
a neutron star or a black hole and typically expels several solar masses of
material into space at velocities of many thousand kilometers per second.

CCSNe play several important roles in astrophysics. They are important
producers of elements from oxygen to iron, crucially aﬀecting the chemical
evolution of galaxies and the Universe. Most of the matter that we see
around us has once been synthesized inside a star that expelled the material
in a SN explosion. The chemically enriched material that is expelled at high
velocities and its kinetic energy shape galaxies. These are the processes that
seed the next generation of stars and allow new planets to form. The neutron
stars and black holes, which are created by CCSNe, are among the most
extreme environments in the Universe. They allow us to test fundamental
physics in regimes that are impossible to probe anywhere else.

SNe have been observed by ancient astronomers long before they were
understood to be astrophysical explosions. Famous historical examples are
the Crab Supernova (SN 1054, Figure 1.1), Tycho’s Supernova (SN 1572;
Brahe 1573), and Kepler’s Supernova (SN 1604; Kepler 1606). The term
“supernova” was coined by Baade and Zwicky (1934), where they also “ad-
vanced the view that a super-nova represents the transition of an ordinary
star into a neutron star.” Much of the foundations of how elements are

created in stars and SN explosion were developed during the 1950s (Hoyle,
1954; Burbidge et al., 1957; Hoyle and Fowler, 1960). The ﬁrst outline of
how the liberated gravitational potential energy can be deposited into the
envelope and turn a central collapse into an explosion in most SNe was made
by Colgate and White (1966), Arnett (1966), and Bethe and Wilson (1985).
A particular event of major importance is SN 1987A, which is the closest
observed SN in more than four centuries. This has helped advance the
ﬁeld and allowed for observations of unprecedented detail. Another factor
that has helped progress the ﬁeld of CCSNe during the past few decades is
the rapid development of computational resources, allowing for much more
sophisticated simulations.

The level of this thesis is set such that it should be accessible to any
reader with a background in any ﬁeld of physics. This implies that parts of
the introduction to subﬁelds speciﬁc to astrophysics are at a relatively basic
level and that important fundamental concepts are reviewed. The experi-
enced reader will hopefully ﬁnd a couple of interesting notes and alternative
perspectives of familiar subjects.

1.1 Context

One of the critical questions in astrophysics that remains unanswered is how
massive stars explode. This has proven to be particularly diﬃcult to solve
because CCSNe are highly complex processes, which involve a number of
diﬀerent physical phenomena. In fact, it is one of the few physical processes
where all four fundamental forces are contributing at signiﬁcant levels. The
problem is further complicated by the very large dynamic range of timescales
and length scales. The evolution of a massive star spans millions of years
and the core collapse occurs on timescales of milliseconds. The detailed
physics also depends on interactions at a microscopic level in systems that
are larger than the Sun. Additionally, CCSNe are clearly three-dimensional
(3D) processes (Figure 1.2). As a consequence of the multifaceted physics
and dynamic ranges, accurate simulations based on ﬁrst principles have
remained computationally unfeasible.

Over the past decades, diﬀerent theories have evolved to describe dif-
ferent parts of the explosion process. These theories make observable pre-
dictions about the properties of the stars just before the explosion, the
particles and radiation emitted by the star during the explosion, and what
will remain after the bright SN starts to fade. The currently favored ex-
plosion mechanism is the delayed neutrino-heating mechanism (for reviews,
see Janka, Marek and Kitaura, 2007; Janka, Langanke, Marek, Mart´ınez-
Pinedo and M¨uller, 2007; Janka, 2012; Burrows, 2013; M¨uller, 2016; Janka,
2017; Burrows and Vartanyan, 2021). At best, it can successfully describe

4

Introduction

the explosion of the most common SNe.
It is clear that a small number
of more extreme SNe require additional processes to be active. Another
independent uncertainty is the accuracy of the progenitor models. SN sim-
ulations are fundamentally initial value problems and cannot be expected
to be more accurate than the progenitor models.

The aim of the work in this thesis has been to compare predictions of
SN theory with observations. The attached papers investigate observables
related to SN progenitors, the explosion mechanism, the formation of com-
pact objects, and interactions between the ejecta and surrounding material.
These comparisons allow us to test how accurate the current description
of CCSNe is. We have focused on comparing predictions of the delayed
neutrino-driven mechanism with observations of SN 1987A. There are sev-
eral properties of the theory that can be tested observationally, such as if
a neutron star or black hole remains after the explosion (Paper I), the 3D
structure of the ejecta (Paper II and III), and how the material is mixed
in the turbulent explosions (Paper III). We also search for the initial X-ray
ﬂashes associated with the onset of the SN explosion (Paper IV) and study
the processes present when the SN material collides with the surrounding
material (Paper V). These comparisons are a small subset of all observa-
tional criteria that any successful explosion theory needs to fulﬁll.

1.2 Conventions

Readers unfamiliar with astronomy might ﬁnd many unusual units and tech-
nical terms. The purpose of this section is to introduce some of the jargon
and mentally prepare the reader for some (sometimes confusing) conven-
tions. Astronomers generally use centimeter-gram-second (cgs) units but
there are also a number of additional units in diﬀerent subﬁelds that have
been introduced for special purposes. A list of common units is provided
in Table 1.1, and physical and astronomical constants in Table 1.2. Optical
ﬂuxes are often given in magnitudes. This is a historic measure of observed
ﬂux and must be calibrated using a given zeropoint. Without going into the
details, the important properties are that each change of 1 mag corresponds
to a change in ﬂux of a factor of 2.5 and the magnitude scale is reversed
(brighter objects have lower, more negative, magnitudes). It is worth em-
phasizing the distinction between magnitude (mag) and order of magnitude
(factors of 10). The unit Crab is sometimes used in X-ray instrumentation
and is simply the observed ﬂux of the Crab Nebula (Kirsch et al., 2005).
This is complicated by the fact that the observed ﬂux varies depending on
the given energy interval. The unit “beam” is mostly used toward longer

Astronomers also label diﬀerent intervals of the electromagnetic spec-
trum roughly following the conventions in Table 1.3. The dividing lines are
not strict and could vary slightly depending on context.
I note that as-
trophysicists rarely use the term microwave unless referring to the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB). Additionally, micron is sometimes seen in-
stead of µm and the wavenumber (inverse wavelength) can be used on rare
occasions, especially in mid-infrared (MIR) and far-infrared (FIR). The def-
inition of optical emission can also sometimes extend to more or less include
ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR). Visible light is sometimes used
to explicitly refer to the visible part of the spectrum. I will use optical for
visible light (i.e. excluding UV and NIR) and use UVOIR to refer to UV,

optical, and NIR combined.

Several of the bands are also subdivided. One of the most common is the
distinction between soft and hard X-rays. The limit between soft and hard
depends on context. If the current context is restricted to below 10 keV, soft
most likely refers to < 2 keV, whereas soft probably refers to < 10 keV if the
context extends to 100 keV. The UV band is sometimes separated into near-
UV and extreme-UV (or far-UV) and gamma-rays with (much) higher en-
ergies are often called (very-)high-energy gamma-rays. Lastly, wavelengths
of atomic and molecular transitions can be given in both vacuum and air.
The wavelengths in air are slightly shorter because of the refractive index
of air of 1.0003. Lines are often given in ˚Angstroms, which means that a
change of the fourth signiﬁcant digit can occur. For example, the important
oxygen line at 5007 ˚A can also be reported as 5008 ˚A.

Astronomers sometimes simplify the periodic table into hydrogen, he-
lium, and metals. These can sometimes be denoted X, Y, and Z, respec-
tively. This means that “metals” will exclusively be used in this meaning
of “everything heavier than helium”. Heavy metals most likely refers to
elements from silicon to around iron.

In the context of SNe and SNRs, it is common to refer to the radial
position in terms of velocity. This always implicitly assumes that the ejecta
are expanding homologously.

Astrometry and photometry are two common astronomical terms. Pho-
tometry means measuring the ﬂux of objects and is mostly used to refer
to ﬂux measurements in UVOIR bands. Astrometry means measuring posi-
tions in the sky. This may sound simple but deﬁning an accurate coordinate
frame is actually rather complicated. The International Celestial Reference
Frame (ICRF) is the standard reference frame. The International Astro-
nomical Union (IAU) standard is to include the epoch, which is the moment
at which the coordinates are valid. The ICRF is a realization of the Interna-
tional Celestial Reference System (ICRS). The ICRF has coordinates that
are ﬁxed in space but there are other frames that require an additional time

Introduction

that deﬁnes at which moment in time the frame is deﬁned. This time is
called the equinox. For example, the coordinate frame that is derived from
the Fifth Fundamental Catalogue (FK5) of stars has the standard equinox
J2000 (2000 January 1, noon Terrestrial Time).

When discussing the distribution of ﬂux over diﬀerent energy bands, it
is common to use the term spectral energy distribution (SED) instead of
spectrum. It is also common to multiply the ﬂux density measure (y-axis)
by the abscissa (x-axis) quantity in SEDs.

Power laws are often used to describe spectral shapes. Each power law
is characterized by a power-law index. This is often called photon index
in X-rays and gamma-rays but can be deﬁned in diﬀerent ways depending
on context. The diﬀerences are the sign and if it is giving the shape of the
photon number ﬂux density or (energy) ﬂux density, which shifts the photon
index by 1.

Chapter 2

Supernova Physics

The purpose of this section is to give readers an overview of the most relevant
physical processes. The physical processes are typically covered in physics
textbooks, but are important enough for this thesis to warrant a qualitative
review. More complete descriptions of these subjects can be found in, e.g.,
Rybicki and Lightman (1979), Cheng (2005), and Harris (2007).

2.1 Emission Processes

This section covers line emission, bremsstrahlung (braking radiation or free-
free emission), synchrotron emission, and inverse Compton scattering, which
are some of the most common emission processes in astrophysical contexts.
Illustrations of the emission processes are provided in Figure 2.1. Elec-
trons are generally more important than positive ions because of the higher
charge-to-mass ratio of electrons. Therefore, the processes are typically
thought of as electron-dominated but the following principles apply to par-
ticles of arbitrary charge.

In astrophysical contexts, line emission (Panel I of Figure 2.1) refers
to the emission of photons with characteristic energy. The term “line”
refers to the shape of such a spectrum. The photon energy is in most cases
determined by diﬀerences in energy levels of an atom when an electron
transitions from a level of higher energy to a lower energy level. The excess
energy is then emitted as a photon. This means that line emission is a
discrete emission process, whereas the other processes in this section are
continuum processes. However, the energy of these transitions is not always
exactly the same. The primary correction to the photon energy is given by
the Doppler shift determined by the relative velocity between the source and
the observer. Because blue photons are more energetic than red photons, the

The smaller gray spheres are electrons and the larger black
spheres are protons (or any positive nucleus in general). Dashed
lines are electron trajectories, the solid black line represents a
magnetic ﬁeld, photons are indicated by waves, and energy lev-
els are illustrated by dotted lines. Line emission (Panel I) occurs
when an electron transitions from a higher to a lower energy level
in an atom. Bremsstrahlung (or free-free emission, Panel II) is
the emission produced by a free electron that is deﬂected by a
positive ion. Synchrotron radiation (Panel III) is produced by
a fast electron gyrating in a magnetic ﬁeld. Inverse Compton
scattering (Panel IV) is when a fast electron interacts with a
photon and transfers energy from the electron to the photon.
See Section 2.1 for details about the emission processes.

IIIIIIIV2.1. Emission Processes

terms “blueshift” and “redshift” are often used to denote emission that has
been Doppler boosted to higher and lower energies, respectively. It is very
common to perform measurements of the Doppler shifts of lines to determine
the velocity of an object along the line of sight (radial velocity). Another
important property of emission lines is their widths, which are determined
by the radial velocity distribution of the individual atoms or macroscopic
objects that constitute the source. In most cases, this is dominated by the
thermal motion of atoms or the random motions of constituting objects.
However, in SNe, the widths of the lines are dominated by the bulk motion
of the outﬂow of the material from the center of the explosion. This means
that material that is bluer is on the near side, whereas the redder emission
originates from the far side. In addition to the energy shift and line width,
the line proﬁle is sometimes discussed. This is essentially just analyzing the
distribution of the emission at diﬀerent line-of-sight velocities.

Bremsstrahlung (Panel II of Figure 2.1) involves a fast electron being
deﬂected by a positively charged ion. This is often described in the frame
where the ion is stationary and the incoming electron is moving, which is
generally a good approximation of the observer’s frame because electrons
are moving much faster than the heavier ions. The acceleration of the
electron as it travels through the electric potential leads to the emission of
a photon and a corresponding energy decrease of the electron. In typical
astrophysical contexts, the emission is characterized by the electron density
and energy distribution, as well as the ion density. Notable properties are
that the emission depends on the product of the density of the electrons
and the ions, and that the photon energy depends on the electron energy.
Synchrotron emission (Panel III of Figure 2.1) is the emission produced
by a relativistic electron (see Section 2.3) in the presence of a magnetic
ﬁeld. The acceleration that gives rise to the helical path also gives rise to
photons with frequencies proportional to the gyration frequency and speed
of the electron. The total power emitted is a function of particle density, the
square of the particle energy distribution, and the square of the magnetic
ﬁeld strength. This process is also called cyclotron emission if the particle
is non-relativistic.

Inverse Compton scattering (Compton 1923, Panel IV of Figure 2.1)
is not strictly an emission process in the sense that photons are created.
Instead, inverse Compton is when a high-energy electron interacts with a
previously existing low-energy photon and transfers some of the energy from
the electron to the photon. This means that any ﬁeld of low-energy photons
could be reprocessed into high-energy photons by high-energy electrons,
which is why inverse Compton scattering is often categorized as an emission
process.
Importantly, the opposite scenario where a high-energy photon
imparts energy to a lower-energy electron is also possible. However, this

12

Chapter 2. Supernova Physics

is often considered an absorption process called Compton scattering (see
Section 2.2).

Lastly, it is worth pointing out that blackbody (thermal) emission is not
an emission process even though it is often used to describe the emission of
a source. Blackbody emission is emission from an opaque, non-reﬂective
source in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment. Blackbody
emission does not specify how the photons are created. A characteristic
is that the escaping spectrum is uniquely determined by the temperature of
the source. This is because the emitter is opaque and the photons are free to
exchange energy with the surroundings, which means that the photons will
adopt an energy distribution determined by allowed quantum states that
are solely dependent on the temperature (Blundell and Blundell, 2010).

2.2 Absorption Processes

This section covers Compton scattering, photoelectric absorption (photoab-
sorption), and dust absorption, which are common absorption processes in
astrophysical contexts. Illustrations of the emission processes are provided
in Figure 2.2. When discussing absorption, it is common to refer to the
interaction cross section. This is a measure of how likely the absorption
process is and is analogous to the classical cross section of macroscopic
objects.

Compton scattering (Panel I of Figure 2.2, see also Paper III) is simply
the opposite of inverse Compton scattering (Section 2.1). In the context of
this thesis, primarily Compton scattering is of importance because it is the
dominating interaction channel for photons with energies in the range of
30 keV–3 MeV. Throughout this energy range, the interaction cross section
per electron remains relatively constant. This means that (neutral) heavier
elements have Compton scattering cross sections that are proportional to
the atomic number. Another important property is that Compton scat-
tering does not destroy photons, whereas both photoabsorption and dust
absorption do.

Photoelectric absorption (Einstein 1905a, Panel II of Figure 2.2, see
also Paper II and III) is the process by which a photon is destroyed by an
electron that is originally bound to an atom. The electron gets unbound
by the incoming energy (which is why photoabsorption is also referred to
as bound-free absorption) and the excess energy is converted into kinetic
energy of the electron. For SN remnants, photoabsorption is important
because it is the dominating absorption channel for photons with energies
of 0.01–30 keV. The photoabsorption cross section is very sensitive to both
the atomic number of the absorbing atom and the photon energy. The cross

cesses. The smaller gray spheres are electrons and the larger
black sphere is a proton (or any positive nucleus in general).
Dashed lines are electron trajectories, photons are indicated by
waves, energy levels are illustrated by dotted lines, and the irreg-
ular gray blobs represent dust. Compton scattering (Panel I) is
when a photon scatters oﬀ an electron and transfers energy from
the photon to the electron. Photoelectric absorption (Panel II)
is the process in which a photon is absorbed by an atom and
the energy goes into a bound electron, which is liberated by the
energy. Dust absorption (Panel III) refers to the absorption of
photons by small particles consisting of a large number of atoms.
See Section 2.2 for details about the absorption processes.

section steeply increases as the atomic number cubed but quickly drops
toward higher energies as the inverse of the energy cubed.

Gas, Molecules, Dust, and Grains

Before outlining the properties of dust absorption, it is important to
make a distinction between the diﬀerent components of matter in SN
remnants. Gas almost always refers to gas dominated by monatomic
gas, which may or may not be an ionized plasma. If the material
consists of molecules such as CO, SiO, H2, it would most likely be
referred to as “molecules”, even though it is in a gaseous phase.
Grains and dust both refer to small particle solids of a few atoms to
a few microns in (linear) size. The compositions of these grains are
often uncertain but they are most likely composed of elements that
are abundant on Earth in solid compounds, such as carbon, oxygen,
silicon, and iron. For intuition, in everyday life, these grains are
more likely to be called soot or ﬁne sand.

Dust absorption (Panel III of Figure 2.2) is not strictly a physical ab-
sorption process at a microphysical level. However, because dust is ubiqui-
tous in space and the composition is poorly constrained, it is customary to
model the dust absorption by a parametrized absorption proﬁle (Cardelli
et al., 1989). Dust absorption is most important at UV wavelengths and
gradually decreases at longer wavelengths (Draine, 2003).

2.3 Relativity

The purpose of this section is to introduce a number of relativistic eﬀects
without going into the theory of relativity. An important prediction of
special relativity (Einstein, 1905b) is that nothing can move faster than
the speed of light in vacuum. The (kinetic) energy of an object can be
arbitrarily high, but the velocity will only tend toward the speed of light as
the energy goes to inﬁnity. Special relativity also describes the relation

E = mc2

(2.1)

that relates energy E of an object to its mass m by the speed of light in
vacuum c. This is important in a number of astrophysical contexts because
some processes are capable of converting a signiﬁcant fraction of the mass
into energy. It is also common to describe particles as relativistic or non-
relativistic. This depends on context but is roughly when the (classical)
kinetic energy is equal to the mc2 energy.

2.3. Relativity

15

General relativity (Einstein, 1916) only introduces signiﬁcant corrections
to Newtonian gravity (Newton, 1687) in very strong gravitational ﬁelds.
This only happens in relatively few systems in the Universe. Two examples
that are connected to SNe are neutron stars and black holes (see Section 3.6).
One consequence of general relativity is that measured quantities are dif-
ferent in diﬀerent frames and there are two particularly important frames.
First, the local frame is where quantities are measured at the position of
the massive object. These quantities can be denoted local, intrinsic, un-
redshifted, or actual. Second, the observer’s frame is “at inﬁnity,” which
implies far from the deep parts of the gravitational well. These quantities
are denoted redshifted, observed, or at inﬁnity.

The magnitude of the general relativistic eﬀects for a neutron star is
conveniently parametrized by the gravitational redshift parameter (Sec-
tion 9.3.1 of Becker 2009)

(cid:114)

gr =

RS(M )

R

(2.2)

(2.3)

where

RS(M ) =

c2

is the Schwarzschild radius, M the mass, R the radius of the neutron star,
and G the gravitational constant. For example, gr = 0.8 at the surface for
typical neutron star parameters where gr = 1 implies ﬂat spacetime. Let
the quantities in the observer’s frame be denoted by subscript ∞, then the
eﬀects on some common quantities are as follows:

• Length (e.g. radius or photon wavelength) R∞ = R/gr
• Time (diﬀerences) ∆t∞ = ∆t/gr
• Temperature T∞ = grT
• (Energy) ﬂux F∞ = g2
r F

Additionally, masses are not uniquely deﬁned in some contexts. For neu-
tron stars, it is common to refer to both gravitational and baryonic masses
(see Section 5.1 of Zhang et al., 2008). Gravitational mass is the mass that
enters into Newton’s law of gravity to describe the gravitational potential
(at distances not too close to the source). The baryonic mass is the mass
that would be measured if you took all particles from the compact object
and moved each particle to inﬁnity (very far away from the source) and
then measured its mass. For neutron stars, the gravitational and baryonic
masses could be diﬀerent. This is because a substantial fraction of the mass-
energy of a neutron star is converted into negative gravitational potential

16

Chapter 2. Supernova Physics

energy when the neutron star forms. Imagine a particle falling into a very
deep gravitational well. The particle would liberate negative gravitational
potential energy and convert it into kinetic energy as it accelerates into the
well. In a simpliﬁed picture of neutron star formation, this kinetic energy
is converted into heat that is subsequently radiated away, which leaves only
the negative gravitational potential energy. By the mass-energy equivalence
[Equation (2.1)], this means that the sum of the original baryonic mass is
higher than the gravitational mass, which is the sum of the baryonic mass
(the stuﬀ that actually makes up the star) and the negative gravitational
potential energy. For typical neutron star parameters, the ratio of grav-
itational to baryonic mass is around 0.9 [Equation (36) of Lattimer and
Prakash 2001].

Mass Diﬀerence and Binding Energy

It is no coincidence that the ratio of gravitational to baryonic mass is
similar to the gravitational redshift factor. The Newtonian binding
energy for a homogeneous sphere is

Eb =

3GM 2
5R → Mb =

3GM 2
5Rc2 ,

(2.4)

where the mass-energy equivalence [Equation (2.1)] was used in the
last step and Mb is the mass corresponding to the binding energy.
On the other hand, from Equations (2.2) and (2.3), we have that

(2.5)

where the approximation holds for RS (cid:28) R. From this, it is clear
that gr is approximately the ratio of baryonic to gravitational mass,
except for a factor of order unity.

2.4 Nucleosynthesis and Radioactivity

Nucleosynthesis means the combination of nucleons into new nuclei. Stel-
lar nucleosynthesis powers stars, which are stable thermonuclear furnaces
throughout their lives (Prialnik, 2000). They are held together by self-
gravity and the high pressures and temperatures allow for the atoms in the
core of the star to undergo fusion. Energy is released by fusing lighter ele-
ments into heavier elements up to 56Fe. Energy is liberated by increasing

2.4. Nucleosynthesis and Radioactivity

17

the (negative) nuclear binding energy. However, combining elements heav-
ier than 56Fe results in a net energy loss because 56Fe has the lowest mass
per nucleon1. This means that the stable thermonuclear fusion chain starts
with hydrogen burning and ends once 56Fe has formed. Explosive or SN
nucleosynthesis occurs during the ﬁrst few seconds after the onset of the
explosion (Hix and Harris, 2017). The radioactive elements created during
this period are of particular importance because they are the primary power
sources for the subsequent phases. When a radioactive element decays, the
atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting particles or radiation.

To avoid confusion, I emphasize the diﬀerence between half-life (often
denoted T1/2) and lifetime (often denoted τ ). The half-life is the time after
which half the original number remains, and the lifetime is equivalent to
an e-folding time (decreased by a factor of e ≈ 2.71828). It is also worth
noting that, in nuclear physics, helium nuclei are frequently referred to as
α particles, electrons as β particles, and positrons as β+ particles2. It is
common not to make a distinction between the emission from the decay,
and from prompt emission by the daughter nucleus. For example, the as-
trophysically important lines at 67.87 and 78.39 keV (Grebenev et al., 2012;
Grefenstette et al., 2014; Boggs et al., 2015) are often referred to as 44Ti
lines, even though they are promptly emitted as a result of nuclear tran-
sitions of 44Sc, which is the daughter product of 44Ti. Nuclear transitions
imply transitions in the energy levels of nucleons, and not the analogue for
electrons, which are more commonly observed. The transition 44Ti → 44Sc
itself is an electron capture transition, which is when p + e− → n + νe.

1The isotope 62Ni has the highest binding energy per nucleon (not contradicting be-
cause of the diﬀerence in proton and neutron mass), which is not formed because it has
no prominent formation channel in stars.

2This naturally explains the term γ-rays, which is another common product of nuclear

reactions.

18

Chapter 3

Core-collapse Supernovae

There are diﬀerent types of SNe that are divided into diﬀerent categories
depending on which process triggers the explosion. This thesis focuses on
CCSNe that are triggered by the collapse of the central iron core. I em-
phasize the period from just before core collapse to the early SNR phase
because of its relevance for this thesis.

3.1 Part of a Cosmic Cycle

It is important to highlight that SNe are part of a cosmic cycle that involves
the births, evolutions, and deaths of stars (Figure 3.1). The cycle is com-
pleted by the formation of the next generation of stars, which are seeded
by the deaths of the previous generation. An arbitrary starting point of
the cosmic cycle can be taken to be the interstellar medium (ISM, Draine
2003). For an evolved galaxy, such as the Milky Way, the ISM constitutes
approximately 10 % of the baryonic mass (i.e., excluding dark matter). The
physics of the ISM is in itself very rich and diverse. One of the most im-
portant connections between the ISM and other astrophysical phenomena
is star formation.

Exactly how stars form remains one of the open questions in modern
astrophysics. The challenge is to describe how the ISM with a mean number
density of around 1 cm−3 collapses to densities on the order of 1026 cm−3,
which is the number density in the center of the Sun. The problem consists
of overcoming both the gas pressure and magnetic pressure, as well as how
the angular momentum is transferred outward.

The next step of the cycle is stellar evolution (Prialnik, 2000). This is
more closely connected to SNe because the last stages of stellar evolution
determine the initial conditions for CCSNe. Of particular relevance for SNe

is the evolution of massive stars. The most basic description of the evolution
of stars relies on one-dimensional (1D) models (Figure 3.2) and simpliﬁed
treatments of the involved physics. This approach has successfully described
many of the general properties of stars. They are essentially self-gravitating
clouds of plasma with high enough temperatures and pressures in the inner
regions to sustain thermonuclear fusion. These simpliﬁed 1D models predict
that the structure of stars is stratiﬁed with progressively heavier elements
toward the center. However, the evolution of the late stages of massive stars
is more complicated than what is captured by simpliﬁed 1D models. The
most important parameters are initial mass, rotation, metallicity, and the
eﬀects of magnetic ﬁelds. In addition, many massive stars evolve as a part of
an interacting binary system. To simulate these processes, it is necessary to
capture physics ranging from very short to very long spatial and temporal
scales. These factors make detailed descriptions of stellar evolution very
challenging.

The following stages that involve the explosion and subsequent evolution
of the young SNR are explained in more detail in Sections 3.2–3.4. Here,
it is simply noted that the ﬁnal fate of the supernova is that the remnant
fades away and merges with the ISM. The end result is that much of the
material of the star is returned to the ISM. This is one of the main drivers
of the chemical evolution of the Universe (Woosley et al., 2002). The kinetic
energy deposited into the ISM also helps trigger the formation of the next
generation of stars and planets. The SNR evolution spans over timescales of
millions of years and the remnants expand to radii on the order of 100 ly. An
interesting point is that SNe occur roughly once every century in galaxies
similar to the Milky Way. From these numbers, it is clear that SNRs will
cover a large fraction of the total volume of a galaxy (McKee and Ostriker,
1977). This implies that SNRs are vital for shaping the ISM environment
in galaxies.

3.2 Core Collapse and Bounce

The study of SNe from the onset of core collapse to an outward explosion
has received much attention over the past decades (Janka, Marek and Ki-
taura, 2007; Janka, Langanke, Marek, Mart´ınez-Pinedo and M¨uller, 2007;
Janka, 2012; Burrows, 2013; M¨uller, 2016; Janka, 2017; Burrows and Var-
tanyan, 2021). CCSNe are termed core collapse because they are triggered
by the core of the star crossing a mass limit determined by the electron
degeneracy pressure. Degeneracy pressure arises from the Pauli exclusion
principle, which states that fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state
simultaneously. Eﬀectively, this implies that astrophysical objects that are

3.2. Core Collapse and Bounce

23

dense enough experience an additional pressure as a result of quantum me-
chanics, which prevents further gravitational compression. When the limit
is crossed, the core cannot withstand the force of gravity. This process is
self-enhancing, so once the collapse has started, the core and all outer layers
keep collapsing into a neutron star. The newly formed neutron star halts
the contraction, which expels the outer layers. This is what then appears
as a SN to observers. However, if neutron degeneracy pressure is overcome,
the star keeps contracting into a black hole.

Once the core collapse is initiated, the contraction increases the tem-
perature. The temperature increase leads to photodissociation of heavy
nuclei into α-particles, and, subsequently, ﬁssioning α-particles into indi-
vidual nucleons, eﬀectively depositing the energy released when fusing the
heavy nuclei. The photodissociation acts as an energy sink, which lowers
the temperature and facilitates further collapse. Thus, these eﬀects com-
bine to form a positive feedback loop. Throughout this process, electrons
are captured by protons, which form neutrons and electron neutrinos. The
neutrinos are able to escape freely during the collapse phase. The collapse
continues until neutron degeneracy pressure dominates, halting the collapse
and forming a neutron star, or, if neutron degeneracy is overcome, contract-
ing further into a black hole.

Gravitational Potential Energy

Fundamentally, CCSNe are powered by gravitational potential en-
ergy released by the contracting core. The energy liberated by ex-
plosive nucleosynthesis contributes at most a small fraction of the
released energy (Burrows, 2013). A simple back-of-the-envelope cal-
culation can be made by computing the change in gravitational po-
tential energy of the core. For a typical initial radius of 10,000 km,
a ﬁnal radius of 10 km, and a mass of 1 M(cid:12), Equation (2.4) gives
a change of binding energy of more than 1053 erg. Thus, the re-
maining question is how to convert approximately a few percent of
the released gravitational potential energy into the observed SNe
(Section 3.3).

A characteristic of CCSNe is the bounce shock associated with the re-
bound of the infalling matter when the proto-neutron star (PNS) is formed.
When the core density reaches nuclear densities of ∼1014 g cm−3, neutron
degeneracy pressure overtakes the other forces at play and the equation of
state suddenly stiﬀens within less than a millisecond (Burrows, 2013). This
is potent enough to reverse the infall to some degree by sending a shock
outwards and was thought to possibly prompt the ejection of the stellar

24

Chapter 3. Core-collapse Supernovae

mantle, i.e. trigger the SN explosion. Therefore, the bounce-shock mecha-
nism attracted much attention in the 1980s (Bethe, 1990).

However, the current consensus is that bounce-shock alone is insuﬃcient
to describe the explosion of any star (Janka, 2012; Burrows, 2013; M¨uller,
2016). The shock is launched from an enclosed mass of ∼0.5 M(cid:12), keeps
propagating outward for ∼70 ms, and reaches a peak radius of 100–200 km
before turning into an accretion shock with negative radial velocity. Energy
is tapped out of the escaping shock through photodissociation of infalling
heavy nuclei. Practically all modern simulations indicate that this is the
ﬁnal fate for the bounce-shock mechanism, i.e. stagnation deep inside the
core of the star (e.g. Mezzacappa et al., 2001). Nevertheless, even though
the bounce-shock mechanism fails to explode the star, it has important
consequences for subsequent processes.

3.3 Explosion Mechanisms

3.3.1 Delayed Neutrino Heating

Mental Image

Presentations (especially visualizations) of SNe often focus on the
high luminosity, which is to say the electromagnetic radiation. How-
ever, the total radiated energy in ordinary SNe is on the order of
1049 erg (e.g. Lyman et al. 2016, Dastidar et al. 2018). This is
only around 1 % of the total kinetic energy, which is on the order of
1051 erg (e.g. Janka et al. 2017 and references therein). The kinetic
energy is also the energy that is customarily referred to as the explo-
sion energy. As shown in Section 3.2, the total liberated energy is
on the order of 1053 erg. Approximately 99 % of this energy escapes
as neutrinos whereas the small fraction that is absorbed powers the
explosion.
The timescales are also quite diﬀerent from the intuitive notion of
an explosion. Whether or not the star collapses into a black hole,
or explodes and leaves a neutron star is determined during the ﬁrst
second after the bounce. The structure of the ejecta is determined
during the ﬁrst few hours. The hydrodynamic processes of the heated
ejecta are in some aspects quite similar to boiling water. All of this
happens before the SN becomes immensely bright, which is what
SNe are most known for. The radiation escapes on timescales of
tens of days because of the time it takes for photons to escape the
thick envelope and the continuous expansion of the ejecta.

3.3. Explosion Mechanisms

25

Much of the modern research has been committed to the study of the
revival of the initial bounce shock through neutrino heating, often referred
to as the delayed neutrino-driven mechanism (Colgate and White, 1966;
Arnett, 1966; Bethe and Wilson, 1985). Neutrino heating is the frontrunner
among the studied explosion mechanisms even though currently far from all
progenitors can be satisfyingly modeled.

In the wake of the bounce shock, the so-called gain radius emerges. For
radii smaller than the gain radius, neutrinos cool, whereas neutrinos heat for
larger radii (Bethe and Wilson, 1985). Eventually, the pressure behind the
shock is suﬃcient to give rise to an outward expansion, eﬀectively reviving
the stalled shock. The amount of dissociated nucleons exposed to strong
neutrino heating behind the shock keeps increasing because of matter being
accreted through the shock front and an increasing shock radius. These
eﬀects combined turns neutrino heating into a partly self-enhancing runaway
process (M¨uller, 2016).

It has been concluded that neutrino heating is insuﬃcient to explode
spherically symmetric stars (e.g. Fischer et al. 2010). However, it is estab-
lished that SNe are highly asymmetrical, being anisotropic from the very
ﬁrst moments of explosions as shown in Figures 1.1 and 1.2. Whether or
not multi-dimensional, particularly 3D, simulations result in successful ex-
plosions through neutrino driving is still an area of active research. It has
been shown that convection and instabilities lower the luminosity required
for an explosion in multiple dimensions by 12–50 % (recent work seems to
favor values in the lower end of the interval), with respect to one dimension
(Nordhaus et al., 2010; Hanke et al., 2012; Fern´andez, 2015; M¨uller and
Janka, 2015; M¨uller et al., 2016).

Going beyond 1D qualitatively alters the conditions for eﬀects such as
convection and non-radial sloshing motions. These hydrodynamical instabil-
ities evolve during the very ﬁrst moments of the explosion and play a critical
role in neutrino driving (Herant et al., 1992, 1994; Burrows et al., 1995; Fryer
and Warren, 2002, 2004). Comparisons between 1D and two-dimensional
(2D) simulations focused on instabilities have been made, showing that 2D
instabilities can be decisive for a successful explosion (Buras et al., 2006;
Marek and Janka, 2009). However, it is possible to ﬁnd plenty of cases of
both failed (e.g. Hanke et al., 2013; Tamborra et al., 2014) and successful
(e.g. Takiwaki et al., 2014; Melson et al., 2015; Lentz et al., 2015) explosions
in 3D.

How instabilities aid neutrino driving is a highly complex process. Ef-
fects such as radial Rayleigh-Taylor ﬁngers convect freshly heated material
from the gain layer further out towards the shock and lets newly infallen
matter down into the heating region. This leads to an overall increase
of temperature and pressure in the gain region, which in turn pushes the

26

Chapter 3. Core-collapse Supernovae

shock outwards. Altogether, it is believed that this triggers a self-sustaining
feedback loop, which eventually leads to the expulsion of the stellar man-
tle (Couch and Ott, 2013; Couch et al., 2015). In contrast, the non-radial
mass ﬂows dissipate kinetic energy in the form of heat, indirectly boosting
the outward, radial expansion and convective activity (Scheck et al., 2008;
Marek and Janka, 2009).

The large-scale asymmetries naturally originate from initial seed pertur-
bations. In particular, it has been advocated that strong seed perturbations
in the infalling oxygen or silicon shells indirectly enhances neutrino driving
(Arnett and Meakin, 2011; Couch and Ott, 2013; M¨uller and Janka, 2015;
Couch et al., 2015; M¨uller et al., 2016). A 3D explosion simulation used
the 3D initial conditions from M¨uller et al. (2017) and used 1D initial con-
ditions as a reference. It was concluded that the shock was revived using
3D initial conditions and that the 1D initial conditions yield no explosion
(M¨uller, 2016; M¨uller et al., 2017).

However, there are SNe that are signiﬁcantly more luminous than stan-
dard SNe (see Section 3.5). This is a problem for the delayed neutrino-
heating mechanism because neutrino-driven simulations indicate that a few
times 1051 erg might be an upper limit to the explosion energy that can
be achieved. Additionally, even though neutrino heating might be the lead-
ing hypothesis, the viability of delayed neutrino heating to explode the less
extreme SNe is also not generally accepted.

3.3.2 Other Mechanisms

Magnetorotational mechanism (MRM) is a magnetohydrodynamic eﬀect
that was, in its most fundamental form, developed during the 1970s (Bis-
novatyi-Kogan, 1970; Ostriker and Gunn, 1971; Meier et al., 1976; Bisnova-
tyi-Kogan et al., 1976). The basic concept is that a nascent PNS has a
high rate of rotation, close to the critical rotation of ∼1 ms. Any signiﬁ-
cantly faster rotation would render gravity unable to hold the neutron star
together. A strong magnetic ﬁeld is also required, approximately 1015 G or
more. Rotational energy from the PNS is then transferred into the man-
tle, depositing enough kinetic energy into the outer stellar layers for it to
be expelled, resulting in a SN explosion. Modern simulations have veriﬁed
that the outlined process is a viable method for expelling the outer layers
(Burrows et al., 2007). It is worth mentioning that MRM may power the
progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts (MacFadyen and Woosley, 1999).

However, because MRM requires a high spin, it is relatively straightfor-
ward to compare pulsar spins with those predicted by MRM theory. Results
show that only less than ∼1% of pulsars are possible MRM SN remnants.
So, even if MRM is a viable mechanism, it is constrained to a very small

3.4. Supernova Remnants

27

population. Therefore, an attractive hypothesis is that MRM powers the
most luminous SNe that have the most rapidly rotating cores (Burrows,
2013).

Alternative suggestions to neutrino heating for standard SNe involve
collapse-induced thermonuclear explosions (Burbidge et al., 1957) and jet-
driven explosions (Soker, 2010). Kushnir and Katz (2015) showed that
thermonuclear explosions are possible for some (tuned) progenitors in 1D
simulations. More ﬁnely tuned models indicate that it is possible to obtain
kinetic energies in the range 1049–1052 erg in 2D thermonuclear explosion
simulations (Blum and Kushnir, 2016). The jet mechanism relies on the
formation of jets by the material infalling onto the nascent neutron star
just after the core collapse to explode the star (Soker, 2017a,b).

3.4 Supernova Remnants

The transition of a SN to a SNR is often taken to be the time when the
emission is dominated by interactions with the surroundings rather than the
decay of radioactive elements created by the explosive nucleosynthesis in the
SN explosion. SNe eject large amounts of matter into space with typical
total kinetic energies of 1051 erg. Ejecta masses are normally in the range
∼4–20 M(cid:12). This means that a typical velocity is ∼3000 km s−1, which is
signiﬁcantly higher than the sound speed of the surroundings. The result is
that a shock wave expands through the circumstellar medium (CSM). The
shock surface serves as the eﬀective boundary of a SNR, which includes the
shock and the ejecta inside of it. Fundamentally, the SNR covers the time
span during which the kinetic energy of the bulk motion is reprocessed into
other forms (Lopez and Fesen, 2018).

The evolutionary stage of a SNR is often categorized depending on the
dominating physical processes (Draine, 2011; Vink, 2012). The important
physical parameters for the evolution of the ejecta are density, pressure,
temperature, and kinetic energy. This is further complicated by asymme-
tries in the ejecta and surrounding material. It is possible that parts of the
ejecta are still expanding freely whereas other parts of the ejecta already
have lost most of their kinetic energy.

The free-expansion (or ejecta-dominated) phase is the ﬁrst phase after
the explosion and lasts roughly until the swept-up mass exceeds the ejecta
mass. This is the only phase relevant to this thesis. Typical velocities of
the fastest SN ejecta are on the order of 104 km s−1, which is signiﬁcantly
higher than the local sound speed of ∼10 km s−1. Furthermore, the ejecta
density at early phases is much higher than the CSM density. This results
in a blast wave propagating outward while the ejecta expand approximately
freely. For a given ejecta mass Mej, CSM density n0, and explosion energy

28

Chapter 3. Core-collapse Supernovae

E51, it is possible to compute the time at which the swept-up mass exceeds
the ejecta mass (Draine, 2011)

Once the swept-up mass is comparable to the ejecta mass, the pressure in
the shell of shocked CSM roughly exceeds the thermal pressure of the ejecta.
This sends a reverse shock inward, which slows and heats the ejecta. It is
worth pointing out that the reverse shock propagates inward as measured
in mass coordinate, which means that it is reaching more of the inner mass.
However, the reverse shock could still be expanding outward in space, but
with a lower radial velocity than the ejecta at that radius. Throughout the
free-expansion phase, the density drops as t−3, and the part of the ejecta
inside of the reverse shock cools due to adiabatic expansion until the reverse
shock reaches it and shock heats it.

Cas A (Figure 1.1, left) is an example of a relatively young and nearby
SNR formed by a SN that was possibly observed by John Flamsteed on
16 August 1680 (Flamsteed, 1725; Kamper, 1980; Hughes, 1980; Ashworth,
1980). The neutron star created by the SN was detected in the ﬁrst light
images of Chandra (Tananbaum, 1999; Pavlov et al., 2000; Chakrabarty
et al., 2001) and does not contribute to the emission of the SNR. This
means that the radiation is powered by the conversion of kinetic energy
through CSM interactions.
In contrast, most of the energy input in the
Crab Nebula comes from the Crab Pulsar (Figure 1.1, right). This type of
nebula is sometimes referred to as a pulsar wind nebula (PWN).

In Cas A, the X-ray emission is mainly bremsstrahlung emission that
originates from gas heated by the reverse shock. The UVOIR is instead
dominated by line emission. In the shocked region, the atoms are ionized
by collisions with thermal electrons. The unshocked interior material is pho-
toionized by UV and X-ray photons from the shock-heated gas with tem-
peratures of several million degrees Kelvin (Milisavljevic and Fesen, 2015).
Cas A is a strong synchrotron source and is the brightest radio (below
100 GHz) source outside of the solar system.

3.5 Types of Supernovae and Their

Progenitors

Even the SNe that arise from the collapse of the iron core of massive stars
are subdivided into several subclasses based on the observed properties. The
classiﬁcation scheme (see Figure 3.3 for an illustration) is important because
SNe are often referred to by their classes. The label also carries information

3.5. Types of Supernovae and Their Progenitors

29

Figure 3.3. CCSN classiﬁcation scheme. See Section 3.5 for
more details on the diﬀerent SN types and their progenitors.

about diﬀerent physical and observational properties. The diﬀerent types
are also closely related to diﬀerent progenitor types. Much eﬀort has been
devoted to the association of diﬀerent types of SNe with observations of
diﬀerent progenitors, but this is a challenging task and is relatively certain
only for some classes (Smartt, 2009). Most of the deﬁning properties are
based on features in optical spectra and light curves. A review of the clas-
siﬁcation of all classes of SNe was recently made by Gal-Yam (2017). It is
worth emphasizing that capitalization is important (i.e. the labels are case
sensitive).

The SNe that show strong signs of hydrogen are classiﬁed as Type II SNe.
Most of these are Type II-P (plateau) SNe. The plateau refers to a period
after the peak during which the brightness stays relatively constant. Those
that show a linear decline post-peak are instead termed Type II-L. The
decline rate is practically always measured in magnitudes per unit time, so
“linear” actually refers to an exponential decline in ﬂux. There are also SNe
that initially show hydrogen signs but later transition into strong helium
lines. These are denoted Type IIb.

Type II-P SNe are thought to originate from red supergiants (RSGs).
Red here refers to the surface color and is essentially a measure of temper-
ature. The density and radii have important consequences for the observed
emission from SNe. A simpliﬁed picture is that SN progenitors are very lu-

Chapter 3. Core-collapse Supernovae

minous, which means that red stars need much larger radii to emit the same
amount of power as a hotter star. Therefore, RSGs have radii of 1000 R(cid:12),
whereas blue supergiants (BSGs) have radii of a few times 10 R(cid:12). This is
primarily a manifestation of diﬀerent densities because the total masses of
BSGs and RSGs are overlapping.

Type IIb SNe are explosions of stars that have lost much of their hydro-
gen envelope. It is possible that Type II-L also represents a class of SNe that
has lost part of the hydrogen. The hydrogen could be continuously shed oﬀ
by the star through its evolution or it could be reduced through interactions
with a binary companion. The consequences for the SN explosion are that
the ejected mass is lower and the expansion velocity is higher. Both of these
factors decrease the optical depth of the ejecta and allow more emission to
escape earlier.

CCSNe can also lack signs of hydrogen, in which case they are classiﬁed
as Type Ib. Additionally, there is a Type Ic class for the SNe that also show
no signs of helium. These are thought to have lost their outer envelopes
through binary interactions. This strips oﬀ the lighter elements and only
leaves the heavier elements in the inner regions. For completeness, there is
also a class called Type Ia, but these are not the result of core collapses in
a massive star.

There are also many more subclasses, such as Type Ic-BL (broad-lined),
superluminous SNe (SLSNe), Type IIn (narrow), and Type II-pec (peculiar).
Type Ic-BL SNe are similar to regular Type Ic but show broader spectral
lines and are thought to be connected to long-duration gamma-ray bursts.
Type IIn SNe show narrow hydrogen lines that arise from ejecta interacting
with the CSM. SLSNe are simply more luminous than normal SNe, often
by more than a factor of 100 (Gal-Yam, 2019). Both Type IIn and SLSNe
are classes that encompass SNe of more than one physical origin. The
Type II-pec are sometimes also called long-rising, slow-rising, or SN 1987A-
like (after the archetype SN 1987A). In contrast to Type II-P, these originate
from BSGs and possibly also intermediate yellow supergiants (Taddia et al.,
2016). Their slow rises are the results of their more compact structures.

A ﬁnal note is that these deﬁnitions are not clear-cut. For example, it has
been argued that very weak signs of hydrogen can be seen in spectra of Ib
SNe and that these should be included in the Type IIb class. Additionally,
the distinction between Type II-P and II-L is more continuous than what
is typically presented.

3.6 Compact Remnants

The compact remnants of SN explosions are expected to be neutron stars or
black holes. Neutron stars are primarily characterized by their mass, radius,

3.6. Compact Remnants

31

spin (rotational period), and magnetic ﬁeld strength, whereas only the mass
and spin are of astrophysical relevance for black holes. In addition to the
characteristics that are intrinsic to the object, the kick (velocity imparted
during the explosion) and interaction with the surroundings are important
observational properties and laboratories for extreme physical phenomena.
A successful CCSN requires the formation of a neutron star, but it is
possible that a small fraction of all SNe is fallback SNe (e.g. Ertl et al.,
2016; Sukhbold et al., 2016). Fallback SNe are those that form a neutron
star but subsequent fallback of material onto the neutron star makes it
collapse into a black hole. These SNe are predicted to be fainter than the
SNe that form stable neutron star remnants. It is also possible for a massive
star to collapse into a black hole with no associated explosion. These black
holes are referred to as direct collapse black holes and the collapses are
classiﬁed as failed SNe, which are not strictly a type of SNe. Detecting
stars the directly implode into black holes is much more challenging. No
unambiguous detection has been made but two candidates have recently
been reported (Reynolds et al., 2015; Adams et al., 2017).

One of the predictions for these formation channels is that successful
explosions should leave neutron stars with masses of 1–2 M(cid:12) and the black
holes should generally have masses above 5 M(cid:12). The mass gap between
2–5 M(cid:12) is thus simply a consequence of the lack of formation channel for
objects in the mass gap, which most likely would be black holes. There is
relatively robust observational evidence of the mass gap (Farr et al., 2011)
and it was replicated reasonably well in a study of remnants in 200 CCSN
simulations by Sukhbold et al. (2016).

3.6.1 Neutron Star Properties

Neutron stars constitute a very diverse group of objects but they all share
some general properties. Neutron stars have masses in the range 1–2 M(cid:12),
radii of 10–13 km, and spin periods of a millisecond to tens of seconds ( ¨Ozel
and Freire, 2016). Because of general relativistic eﬀects, the quantities are
dependent on where the measurement is performed and how much internal
energy that remains contained by the neutron star (see Section 2.3). A very
rough estimation of the diﬀerence by measuring the intrinsic properties is a
relative change of 20 % for most quantities.

Neutron stars also interact with the environment, which is the supernova
remnant for young neutron stars. The surface magnetic ﬁeld strengths of
neutron stars are ranging from 109 to 1015 G. The magnetic ﬁeld is often
modeled as a rotating dipole in vacuum (Gunn and Ostriker, 1969), but more
accurate descriptions are still being developed (e.g. Spitkovsky, 2006). The
magnetic ﬁelds act on the environment because neutron stars are rotating

32

Chapter 3. Core-collapse Supernovae

and the magnetic and rotational axes are generally not aligned. Faucher-
Gigu`ere and Kaspi (2006) estimated that the birth periods of typical pulsars
are 300± 150 ms. We note that the value is based on available observations
of Galactic pulsars and that it is model-dependent. Highly model-dependent
estimates of extreme, extragalactic SNe indicate that a small fraction of all
SNe produce neutron stars with spin periods between 1 and 10 ms (Nicholl
et al., 2017; Blanchard et al., 2020; Hsu et al., 2021).

Typical natal kick velocities of pulsars are on average ∼400 km s−1 but
can be even larger than 1000 km s−1 in some cases (Hobbs et al., 2005;
Faucher-Gigu`ere and Kaspi, 2006). A possible explanation for the kicks is
that the ejecta is expelled asymmetrically, which requires a velocity to be
imparted to the neutron star to conserve momentum (Scheck et al., 2006;
Wongwathanarat et al., 2010; Janka, 2017). Thus, kicks serve as a probe
of the explosion mechanism, but also complicate the association of older
neutron stars with their birth SNR.

3.6.2 Accretion

Accretion is the process by which material falls onto a central object (Frank
et al., 2002).
It is clear that infalling material would not emit radiation
unless accretion processes transform kinetic energy into radiation. Grav-
ity is the attractive force that pulls material inward but in practice, the
process is limited by angular momentum transfer and interactions within
the infalling material, which is where the energy is reprocessed into elec-
tromagnetic emission. This also makes it one of the very few ways that
black holes manifest themselves. It is worth mentioning that accretion is
not limited to the accretion of matter onto neutron stars and black holes.
Accretion processes are also responsible for the formation of galaxies, stars,
and planets.

Accretion Eﬃciency

In the context of compact objects, accretion is important because it
is one of the most eﬃcient processes of converting rest mass energy
to electromagnetic energy. Eﬃciency is usually measured in terms
of an eﬃciency parameter η deﬁned as the fraction of rest mass
energy released [see Equation (2.1)]. A comparison between diﬀerent
mechanisms can be made. The eﬃciency of chemical reactions such
as burning of coal is ∼10−8 %, that of nuclear fusion, speciﬁcally
4H → He (a typical stellar process), is ∼0.7 % whereas a typical
value for accretion is ∼10 %.

3.6. Compact Remnants

33

Compact objects that are actively accreting material are luminous elec-
tromagnetic sources. The radiation originates from an accretion disk or,
for neutron stars only, from interactions on the surface. The most com-
mon characteristics of accretion are X-ray emission and variability on short
timescales. The shortest timescale is approximately determined by the light
crossing time, i.e. the size of the object divided by the speed of light.

Accretion could occur in diﬀerent types of environments. For young
compact objects, the accreted material is most likely from the SN ejecta.
This is called fallback accretion and could be occurring continuously from
the SN explosion moment until thousands of years later (Rees, 1988; Phin-
ney, 1989; Evans and Kochanek, 1989). For older objects, a more likely
source of material is a binary companion that evolves into a stellar evolu-
tion stage where it expands. This expansion could cause the outer parts to
be more strongly attracted by the binary compact companion. A result of
this is the expanding star starts losing material, which is accreted by the
compact object. The accretion process is fundamentally the same in both
cases even though the situations are diﬀerent.

3.6.3 Pulsars

The term pulsar was originally coined to describe a mysterious object that
was observed to emit radio pulses at a regular interval of 1.33 s (Hewish
et al., 1968). This is a result of the combination of the strong magnetic
ﬁelds with the short rotational periods. The emission is observed to pulsate
because the radiation is beamed along the axis of the magnetic dipole. This
means that emission is observable from Earth only when the beams sweep
our line of sight. A consequence of this is that many neutron stars should
have beams of radio emission that are not observable from Earth, but an-
other possibility is also that not all neutron stars are radio pulsars. It was
later discovered that the pulsating emission can be observed in virtually
all wavelengths for some objects. A notable example is the neutron star
that resides in the Crab Nebula (B¨uhler and Blandford, 2014), which has a
period of 34 ms today.

It is common to assume that the observed bolometric luminosity (L)
of a pulsar is equivalent to the decrease in rotational energy (− ˙E), often
referred to as spin-down luminosity. This is very powerful and connects the
observed luminosity to the physical properties of the pulsar. If B is taken
to be constant and the pulsar is modeled as a rotating magnetic dipole in

34

Chapter 3. Core-collapse Supernovae

Figure 3.4. The colormap represents the pulsar luminosity
modeled by Equation (3.2) as a function of B and P . The black
points are Galactic pulsars (Manchester et al., 2005) and the
large white diamond is the Crab Pulsar. The red points clus-
tered at low periods are inferred from SLSNe (Nicholl et al.,
2017), whereas the two brown triangles at high magnetic ﬁelds
are for Type Ic-BL SNe (Wang et al., 2017). The parameters for
the last two classes of extreme SNe are highly model-dependent
and much more uncertain. The hollow squares show the birth
parameters for which light curves are shown in Figure 3.5.

where B is the equatorial surface magnetic ﬁeld strength, R the neutron

of light curves for luminous and rapidly evolving pulsars is shown in Fig-
ure 3.5. The parameters for this set of pulsars are also shown in Figure 3.4.
Notably, this shows that the set only spans a small fraction of the entire
pulsar parameter space, highlighting the diversity among pulsars. A some-
what intuitive interpretation for the light curves is that B determines how
fast energy is tapped from the reservoir, whereas P sets the total amount of
energy available. It is also worth noting that pulsars with the same B have
similar luminosities for t (cid:29) t(cid:48). In addition to the wide range of luminosi-
ties, it also visualizes the large range of timescales (t(cid:48)) for diﬀerent pulsar
parameters.

Finally, it is worth pointing out that pulsars can increase their spin rate
if they acquire angular momentum from an external source. The fastest
spinning pulsars are the millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with periods less than
approximately 10 ms. The prevailing explanation for their high spins is that
they are spun-up (“recycled”) by accretion from binary companion stars
(Alpar et al., 1982; Radhakrishnan and Srinivasan, 1982). The accreted
material could then bury the magnetic ﬁeld, which allows the pulsars to keep
their high spin. When the binary companion has died, only the millisecond
pulsar remains observable.

3.6.4 Thermal Surface Emission

All neutron stars are also expected to emit thermal emission from the sur-
face. The ﬁrst cooling stage of neutron stars is dominated by neutrino emis-
sion from the core. This means that the core temperature evolves almost
independently of the crust and that the core cools faster than the crust.
The neutron star then enters a stage of thermal crust relaxation when the
cooling wave from the core reaches the surface. This happens on a timescale
of a few years when the age of the neutron star is 10–100 years. The sur-
face temperature during these early stages is expected to be on the order of
millions of Kelvin. Observations of thermal relaxation would provide clues
to the physics of the interior of neutron stars (Gnedin et al., 2001; Shternin
and Yakovlev, 2008; Page et al., 2009).

1There is a typographical error in Equation (6) of Paper I. P should be P0 in that

equation, such that it matches Equation (3.4) above.

3.7. 3D Structure of SNe

37

One class of neutron stars, called central compact objects (CCOs), are
observed to only emit thermal radiation, show no signs of pulsar activity,
and are associated with SNRs. Spin-down rates of three CCOs have been
measured to be low, which implies low external magnetic dipole ﬁelds of ap-
proximately < 1011 G (Halpern and Gotthelf, 2010; Gotthelf et al., 2013).
This would be approximately an order of magnitude weaker than for most of
the observed pulsars (Manchester et al., 2005; Luo et al., 2015). Some CCOs
display anisotropic surface temperatures (Halpern and Gotthelf, 2010; Got-
thelf et al., 2013; Bogdanov, 2014; Rea et al., 2016). A possible explanation
for temperature anisotropies is that a stronger magnetic ﬁeld that aﬀects
the thermal properties is trapped inside the neutron star by fallback accre-
tion in the past (Ho, 2011; Bernal et al., 2013; Perna et al., 2013; Bogdanov,
2014).

3.7 3D Structure of SNe

Most of stellar evolution is typically assumed to be an approximately spher-
ical process. However, it is immediately clear from observations of SNRs
that they are clearly asymmetric (Hwang et al., 2004; Grefenstette et al.,
2017; Larsson et al., 2016; Abell´an et al., 2017). In addition to the asym-
metric morphology, the mixing of materials is also important. Mixing refers
to the breaking of the stratiﬁed radial structure (see Figure 3.2) and blend-
ing of regions of diﬀerent compositions. The mixing is important for the
explosive nucleosynthesis, for the emission from subsequent phases, and as
an important property of the explosion mechanism. The small-scale (micro-
scopic) mixing is also important for the formation of dust and molecules in
the ejecta. The spatial distributions of the heavy metals are sensitive probes
of the explosion mechanism because they are synthesized in the innermost
regions close to the explosion engine.

Exactly how and when the spherical symmetry is broken is an area of
active research. Hydrodynamic instabilities in neutrino-driven SN simula-
tions are capable of producing asymmetries that are qualitatively similar to
observed SNRs (Hammer et al., 2010; Janka, 2017; Wongwathanarat et al.,
2017; Gabler et al., 2021). These asymmetries can develop from almost
spherical progenitor models, but it is also possible that the instabilities de-
veloped during the explosion are seeded by violent convection in the last
stages of the evolution of the progenitors (Couch et al., 2015; M¨uller et al.,
2017; Yadav et al., 2020; Yoshida et al., 2021).

The clear breaking of all spatial symmetries on many length scales from
the very ﬁrst moments of explosion can be clearly seen in Figure 1.2. The ra-
dial convective instabilities, i.e. Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, on large scales

with the triple-ring nebula are just two stars unrelated to SN
1987A and happen to be projected close to SN 1987A.

eﬀectively transport ejecta from deep within the core through the outer hy-
drogen and helium layers resulting in strong mixing and breaking of the
stratiﬁcation developed throughout stellar evolution (Figure 3.2). Typical
velocities for the bulk of the iron-group elements are in the range 1000–
2000 km s−1. However, observations have shown that a smaller fraction
is accelerated to signiﬁcantly higher velocities (Arnett et al., 1989; Grefen-
stette et al., 2017). Velocities up to 4500 km s−1 for several 10−3 M(cid:12) of 56Ni
and other iron-peak elements have also been found in simulations (Hammer
et al., 2010).

3.8 SN 1987A

SN 1987A (Figure 3.6) was ﬁrst detected on 1987 February 23 (Kunkel
et al., 1987) and has been thoroughly studied ever since (for reviews, see
Arnett et al., 1989; McCray, 1993; McCray and Fransson, 2016). What

3.8. SN 1987A

39

makes SN 1987A unique is that it is located in the Large Magellanic Cloud,
which makes it the closest observed SN since Kepler’s SN in 1604 (Kepler,
1606). Consequently, SN 1987A is the only SN that allows astronomers
to perform detailed observations at late times and also allows us to detect
much fainter components that are otherwise too weak to be observed. For
example, it has been possible to spatially resolve the evolution of SN 1987A
(e.g. Wang et al., 2002; Larsson et al., 2016, 2019; Abell´an et al., 2017;
Cigan et al., 2019) and it is clear that the outer layers are powered by CSM
interactions rather than radioactive decay (Larsson et al., 2011). A mosaic
of this evolution is shown in Figure 3.7.

Additionally, it is the only CCSN where the early radioactive emission
has been observed in X-rays and gamma-rays (e.g. Dotani et al., 1987; Sun-
yaev et al., 1987; Matz et al., 1988), which is used for the analysis in Pa-
per III. One of the important implications of these observations is that the
radioactive material must have been mixed from the core where they are
formed to the outer layers (e.g. Pinto and Woosley, 1988). Large amounts
of dust have been detected in the ejecta (Matsuura et al., 2011; Indebetouw
et al., 2014; Matsuura et al., 2015; Cigan et al., 2019), which implies that
CCSNe could be important dust factories. Another consequence of the dust
is that our view of the innermost regions is partly obscured in UVOIR. This
is very important for our conclusions in Paper I.

Three rings that form an hourglass-like shape can be seen around SN
1987A, sometimes called the triple-ring nebula (Figure 3.6). The rings are
created by material expelled before the SN explosion and constitute part
of the CSM. The vast majority of the material expelled by the SN remains
inside the smallest inner ring. The central ring is the brightest at all wave-
lengths and is currently violently interacting with the ejecta. It is assumed
to mark the equator of the progenitor and is often called the equatorial
ring. The two outer rings are much fainter and are seen in some optical
images. There are also two very bright stars that are close to SN 1987A (in
sky projections) that are unrelated to SN 1987A. These stars are sometimes
referred to as Stars 2 and 3, where Star 1 would be Sanduleak -69◦ 202
(Walborn et al., 1987). Unintuitively, Star 3 is the one closer than Star 2,
possibly because Star 2 was more easily distinguishable in early images.

The progenitor was identiﬁed as Sanduleak -69◦ 202, which was a BSG
(West et al., 1987; White and Malin, 1987; Kirshner et al., 1987; Walborn
et al., 1987). Sanduleak -69◦ 202 was classiﬁed as B3 Ia with a tempera-
ture of 15,750 K, a radius of 40 R(cid:12), and a luminosity just above 100,000 L(cid:12)
(Walborn et al., 1987; Trundle et al., 2007; Smartt, 2009). The identiﬁcation
of Sanduleak -69◦ 202 as the progenitor and that it was a BSG were impor-
tant to our description of SNe. An important note is that it is still unclear
how a star could evolve and undergo core collapse with the observed prop-

Space Telescope. The ring is often called the equatorial ring
and is clearly structured on small scales. The ring increases
in brightness because the ejecta from the explosion (the clearly
evolving central point) slowly collide more violently with the
ring, which heats it and makes it brighten.

erties of Sanduleak -69◦ 202. There are also additional constraints, such as
the existence of the triple-ring nebula and its composition. One hypothesis
is that SN 1987A is the result of a binary merger 20,000 years before the
explosion (Blondin and Lundqvist, 1993; Morris and Podsiadlowski, 2007,
2009; Menon and Heger, 2017; Menon et al., 2019) or a rapidly rotating
progenitor (Chita et al., 2008).

Another major milestone associated with SN 1987A was the detection of
the prompt neutrino burst, which signaled the formation of a compact object
(Hirata et al., 1987; Bratton et al., 1988; Burrows, 1988). This is important
because it is a very ﬁrm prediction that underpins all of CCSN theory. This
was also the ﬁrst detection of astrophysical neutrinos and marked the birth
of multi-messenger astronomy (if solar neutrinos are excluded). However,
no electromagnetic signal from the compact object has been detected and
observations are able to put relatively strong constraints on the remaining
possibilities. This is the topic of Paper I.

42

Chapter 4

Observations

This chapter is an overview of key properties of diﬀerent kinds of astronom-
ical observatories. It is aimed toward physicists not familiar with observa-
tional astronomy. Paper I relies on observations spanning practically the
entire spectrum. Papers II and III are limited to X-ray and gamma-rays.
Papers IV and V exclusively use X-ray data and are to large extents exer-
cises in observational X-ray astronomy. I cover the entire electromagnetic
spectrum in this chapter, except for X-rays. This is presented separately
and in greater detail in the next chapter because of the focus on X-rays of
the attached papers.

It is important to make a distinction between the telescope and the in-
strument. The instrument refers to the device that detects the photons
collected by the telescopes. Many telescopes are equipped with several in-
struments with very diﬀerent capabilities. For ground-based telescopes (and
in exceptional cases also space-based), the instruments can be upgraded or
replaced, which could signiﬁcantly improve the scientiﬁc capabilities of the
same telescope. To avoid confusion, some facilities are referred to as obser-
vatories (particularly the space-based) and can have several telescopes.

There are several diﬀerent kinds of astronomical measurements. The
most intuitive is imaging, which just means taking a picture of a part of the
sky. Of great scientiﬁc importance are measurements of spectra. In general,
the spectra of diﬀerent astronomical objects carry much more information
than the corresponding images. A problem with obtaining spectra is that it
is observationally and technically more challenging. Additionally, photons
are also characterized by polarization. Polarimetric information is some-
times used to infer properties about special physical processes that give rise
to polarized emission. The aforementioned properties can also be combined,

43

44

Chapter 4. Observations

such as integral ﬁeld spectroscopy (imaging and spectroscopy) or spectropo-
larimetry (spectroscopy and polarimetry).

Another avenue of analyzing astronomical objects is by observing how it
varies over time. This includes SNe that are transients, meaning that they
appear and then disappear. But there are also numerous objects in space
that are variable, which means that they are persistent sources that have
some properties that change as a function of time. This could, for example,
be a change in the accretion rate onto a compact object or the change in
observed brightness of a star when an orbiting planet passes in front of it.

4.1 General Properties of Observations

Many general properties of telescopes are similar throughout the electro-
magnetic spectrum. The most obvious being the size of the telescope or the
eﬀective area. Sometimes eﬃciency is mentioned, which refers to the prob-
ability that an incoming photon is detected. To ﬁrst order, the eﬃciency is
the factor that converts the telescope area to the eﬀective area.

Another important characteristic is the angular resolution of a telescope.
This is roughly the minimum angular separation at which two individual
objects can be distinguished. It is worth emphasizing that the resolution
is rarely set by the pixel size and that it has nothing to do with the total
number of pixels, which is what is commonly used as resolution measures
for everyday images.

A concept that is closely related to the angular resolution is the point
spread function (PSF, or point response). This is how a point source of emis-
sion would appear as observed by the telescope. It is useful because many
sources at astronomical distances can be approximated as point sources.
The shapes of PSFs are often similar to Gaussians or the superposition of
two Gaussians.

What determines the angular resolution is in some cases technical diﬃ-
culties related to how the photons are measured. However, a fundamental
limit is set by diﬀraction, called the diﬀraction limit. Classically, this is the
interference that arises when waves encounter an obstacle. The diﬀraction
limit is proportional to the wavelength over the linear size of the object. In
the context of telescopes, the size is the telescope. This means that larger
telescopes oﬀer sharper images while also collecting more photons.

In addition to the angular resolution, it is also common to refer to the
spectral and temporal resolution of an instrument, if applicable. Spectral
resolution refers to the accuracy of the measurement of the photon energies
and temporal resolution is the accuracy of the photon arrival time mea-
surement. Spectral resolution is typically given by the smallest measurable

4.1. General Properties of Observations

45

energy diﬀerence ∆E over the photon energy E, or by resolving power,
which is the inverse of spectral resolution.

Other properties of astronomical measurements are the exposure and
ﬁeld of view. These are completely analogous to those of everyday pho-
tography. Typical astronomical exposures range from hundreds of seconds
to weeks. Fields of view also vary over many orders of magnitude. The
smallest pencil-beam observations cover less than 1 arcsec2 (a grain of sand
at a distance of 100 m) to all-sky monitors that cover 2π sr (half the sky).
All observations also suﬀer from background. This is typically a com-
bination of the noise from the instrument and the emission from other as-
trophysical sources. A standard step in almost every data reduction is to
subtract the background, often by sampling the background from a nearby
representative region free of source emission.

A complicated measurement that is an important characteristic of every
instrument is its sensitivity. This is essentially the minimum brightness
that can be detected in a given observation.
It is complicated because
it is a non-trivial combination of the resolutions, eﬀective area, eﬃciency,
exposure, background levels, source properties, and where in the ﬁeld of
view it is observed.

The atmosphere also aﬀects observations by absorbing and distorting
the incoming light. The most familiar atmospheric window where photons
are transmitted is the optical window, which peaks around what humans
can see. It extends from photon wavelengths of around 300 nm to 2.5 µm.
The majority of all observatories operate in this range. The second big
atmospheric window is in radio to sub-mm from around 30 m to 0.3 mm
(1 THz). This is why practically all of the big radio dishes are ground-
based. There are several narrower windows in the M-band at 5 µm, the
N-band between 8 to 13 µm and the Q-band between 17 and 20 µm. These
are much less used, partly because the thermal blackbody emission of the
atmosphere (around typical temperatures) peaks in this range. The remain-
ing wavebands are almost exclusively observed from space, or in rare cases
high-altitude airborne or balloon-borne instruments.

Another eﬀect of the atmosphere is that it blurs the view of the skies
at angular resolutions below approximately 1 arcsec. This is often called
atmospheric seeing and is an eﬀect of the atmosphere being dynamic and
non-homogeneous, which distorts the light through refraction. This is most
problematic for the latest and upcoming generations of ground-based optical
and NIR telescopes. To correct for atmospheric seeing, a technique called
adaptive optics has been developed. This basically means that the atmo-
spheric distortions are measured and small live mechanical adjustments are
made to the shape of the mirrors to compensate for the distortions at ad-
justment frequencies on the order of 1 kHz. One method of measuring the

46

Chapter 4. Observations

atmospheric distortions is to project a guide “star” using a laser.

Because of the absorption and distortion, it is common to construct
observatories at high altitudes. Humidity is also a key parameter when
choosing sites because water vapor limits observations in certain bands.

4.2 Individual Wavebands

4.2.1 Radio and (sub-)mm

Radio and (sub-)mm observations reveal objects that produce synchrotron
emission and dust emission. Examples of synchrotron sources are shocks
in SNRs and jets launched by accretion onto compact objects. The cold
dust emission peaks toward the shorter wavelengths and is ubiquitous in all
galaxies. Other notable observables are the spin-ﬂip of hydrogen at 21 cm,
the cosmic microwave background around 1 mm, and several molecular ro-
tational transitions toward shorter wavelengths.

Radio telescopes use large dishes that are relatively easy to construct
because the required precision of the dish only needs to be smaller than the
wavelength. This means that the collecting area of radio and (sub-)mm tele-
scopes are very large, with single dishes up to 500 m in diameter. However,
the long wavelengths also mean that the energy carried by each photon is
very low, and very large areas are required to reach competitive sensitivities.
It is also very uncommon for astrophysical objects to have a large fraction
of the total energy output at wavelengths longer than a few millimeters.

Long wavelengths also mean that the diﬀraction limit is very high, even
for the largest telescopes. A method of improving the angular resolution is
to measure incoming wavefronts using several dishes and then reconstructing
the complete waveforms, a method called aperture synthesis or interferom-
etry (Ryle and Hewish, 1960). The result is that the diﬀraction limit can
be reduced to the diﬀraction limit of an instrument with a size equivalent
to the longest separation between two dishes. The separations between the
dishes are called baselines. Even though the diﬀraction limit is equal to that
of the array as a whole, the arrays are typically sparse with a few dishes
spread out over a much larger area. This means that there eﬀectively are
holes in the synthesized aperture, from which the information has to be
reconstructed in the data processing.

Interferometry has been employed in radio for several decades and is
currently being pioneered in NIR. However, combining the data from dif-
ferent telescopes at higher frequencies than around 1 THz is much more
challenging and is still in its infancy. Two notable instruments in the
radio and (sub-)mm range are Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA,

4.2.

Individual Wavebands

47

Thompson et al. 1980; Perley et al. 2011) and the Atacama Large Millime-
ter/submillimeter Array (ALMA, Wootten and Thompson 2009).

4.2.2 Far- and Mid-Infrared

FIR and MIR cover emission from cool material (approximately below stan-
dard temperature), and atomic and molecular lines, a notable example is
the H2O ground state line at 179 µm. This wavelength range is diﬃcult
to observe because the relatively long wavelengths require large telescopes
in order to achieve angular resolutions comparable to many other wave-
bands. This is similar to radio, but the diﬀerence is that FIR and MIR
are absorbed by the atmosphere, which means that observatories must be
placed in orbit. Additionally, the detectors need to be cooled to reduce
the thermal noise from the detector itself. There are a small number of
instruments that operate from airplanes to avoid most of the atmosphere,
or in the narrow bands in the MIR where ground-based observations are
possible. However, the thermal emission from the atmosphere still results
in extremely high background levels that require special observing modes.
The Herschel Space Observatory (Pilbratt et al., 2010) was a recent large-
class FIR mission that was decommissioned in 2013 and the James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST ; Gardner et al. 2006) is an upcoming MIR (and
NIR) observatory slated for launch on 2021 October 31.

4.2.3 UV, Optical, and NIR

Out of all wavebands, the UVOIR range is by far the most mature (and
oldest, e.g. Copernicus, 1543; Brahe, 1573; Galilei, 1632). It includes the
thermal emission of warm material (approximately 300 K to 1 MK) and
many well-observed atomic transitions. This includes emission from stars,
SNe, SNRs, and accretion onto compact objects.

The images that are taken in UVOIR are in principle similar to every-
day photography in many ways. However, one important diﬀerence is that
astronomical UVOIR observations are almost exclusively in one ﬁlter. A
ﬁlter is simply something that is placed in the optical path and only lets
through light within a certain wavelength range. This is because UVOIR
CCDs (Boyle and Smith, 1970) are not inherently color sensitive. The rea-
son that common CCDs capture color is because there are sets of three
diﬀerent CCDs with ﬁlters corresponding to red, green, and blue. Another
way to view it is that every color picture taken by an everyday camera is,
in fact, three simultaneous pictures taken in red, green, and blue ﬁlters,
which combined results in one color image. This is similar to what is done
in astronomy, the diﬀerence being that astronomical observations are not

48

Chapter 4. Observations

limited to three ﬁlters in the optical part of the spectrum. In contrast, it is
common to simply have one R-band (red) image, which is then visualized
using an arbitrary colormap.

Spectroscopy is sometimes performed using slits. When the incoming
light passes through the narrow opening, diﬀraction splits the light into
diﬀerent colors, which are then registered using CCDs. More modern in-
struments are now capable of performing integral ﬁeld spectroscopy where a
spectrum is extracted from every pixel in the image. What happens under
the hood in these instruments is basically the same. The diﬀerence is simply
that the light that would have landed on one traditional imaging pixel is
redirected onto a grating (or equivalent) such that the diﬀracted spectrum
can be recorded by a CCD. Imaging spectroscopy often comes at the cost
of another quality, such as reduced ﬁeld of view or lower angular resolu-
tion. Two examples of such integral ﬁeld units (IFUs) are the Multi-Unit
Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE, Bacon et al. 2010) and the Spectrograph
for INtegral Field Observations in the Near Infrared (SINFONI, Eisenhauer
et al. 2003; Bonnet et al. 2004) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT).

Cosmic rays and other high-energy particles also trigger CCDs. To miti-
gate the eﬀects of particles in observations, it is common to combine several
individual exposures into a ﬁnal image. The particle interactions will then
clearly show up as bright points or streaks in one of the exposures and
can easily be removed when compared to the other images. In addition to
removing cosmic rays, it is possible to shift the pointing of the telescope
between each exposure by what corresponds to fractions of a pixel to a few
pixels. This procedure is called dithering. The process results in a sam-
pling of diﬀerent physical pixels that could have varying eﬃciency, ﬁlls in
gaps between diﬀerent CCD chips, and possibly also improves the sampling
of the PSF. For example, this is performed for all Hubble Space Telescope
(HST ) observations in standard operation modes.

4.2.4 Gamma-Rays

Gamma-ray astronomy is closely related to X-ray astronomy. Examples of
gamma-ray phenomena are jets that are aligned with our line of sight, young
magnetars, and emission originating from the decay of radioactive elements
(Paper III).

A major diﬀerence for gamma-ray astronomy is that there is no focusing
optics, but collimators and coded masks are both used. At these photon
energies, the detection techniques are partly overlapping with the detection
techniques of charged particles. Gamma-ray detectors generally have low
angular resolution and a high background level compared to other detectors.

4.3. Multi-messenger Astronomy

49

One method of detecting gamma-rays is to let gamma photons interact
with material, form an electron-positron pair, and then measure the shower
of secondary particles that are created. From the direction of the secondary
shower, it is possible to reconstruct the incident direction and photon energy.
This is the technology used by the Large Area Telescope (LAT, Atwood et al.
2009) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi ).

There are also semiconductor detectors that detect the electrons and
positive ions that are produced when a high-energy photon passes through
the material. An example is the high-purity germanium detectors that con-
stitute the SPectrometer onboard INTEGRAL (SPI, Vedrenne et al. 2003;
Roques et al. 2003) on board the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics
Laboratory (INTEGRAL, Winkler et al. 2003). Another type of detector is
the scintillator, which is a material that emits ﬂashes of light when excited
by high-energy radiation. This is used to detect gamma-ray bursts by the
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM, Meegan et al. 2009) on board Fermi.

Lastly, for very-high-energy gamma-rays, there are ground-based tele-
scopes that observe the light emitted by the secondary particle shower in-
duced by the primary gamma-ray. The secondary particles travel at veloci-
ties higher than the speed of light in air, which results in so-called Cherenkov
radiation. This is similar to sonic booms for acoustic waves. The High En-
ergy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S., Hinton and the HESS Collaboration
2004) is an example of such a telescope.

4.3 Multi-messenger Astronomy

It is also important to mention that not all astronomical observations are
measurements of electromagnetic radiation. Several astronomical objects
also accelerate charged particles to very high energies, ﬁrst detected by Hess
(1912). For historical reasons, these particles are called cosmic rays even
though they are particles and not radiation. Today, several large facilities
are able to detect these energetic particles of astrophysical origins.

Neutrinos are another type of particle that is generated by astrophysical
processes. They are not charged and a characteristic trait is that they
are very weakly interacting. Because of the diﬀerent physics involved in
both the origin and detection of neutrinos, they are considered a separate
channel from cosmic rays. Neutrino detectors are typically large-volume
water (e.g. Super-Kamiokande; Fukuda et al. 2003) or ice (e.g. IceCube;
IceCube Collaboration et al. 2006) detectors.

A fundamentally diﬀerent method of astronomical observations is grav-
itational waves. They are disturbances in spacetime generated by the ac-
celeration of masses. Gravitational waves were ﬁrst indirectly inferred in

50

Chapter 4. Observations

a binary neutron star system (Hulse and Taylor, 1975; Taylor and Weis-
berg, 1989), and recently directly detected from a binary black hole merger
by the LIGO and Virgo collaboration (Abbott et al., 2016). Gravitational
waves and mass are in many aspects the gravitational equivalent of electro-
magnetic waves (photons) and charge. The main diﬀerence being that the
gravitational eﬀects are much weaker, which is why only the most massive
objects under extreme acceleration generate detectable gravitational waves.

X-Ray Astronomy

X-rays are eﬀectively absorbed by the atmosphere and are only observed
from space, or high-altitude balloons and rockets. It is a relatively young
ﬁeld and was initiated by the ﬁrst X-ray detection of an extrasolar source
by Giacconi et al. (1962). X-rays primarily originate as thermal emission
from hot gas (above 1 MK) and as non-thermal emission from relativistic
electron populations.

Since most of the attached papers mainly rely on X-ray data, a more
detailed description of X-ray astronomy is provided in this chapter. The
purpose is to introduce concepts to facilitate understanding of the analyses
performed in the attached papers, not necessarily serving as an independent
introduction to X-ray astronomy.

5.1 Telescopes

X-ray telescopes are very diﬀerent from telescopes at lower energies. First,
there is no primary mirror that is analogous to the primary of optical tele-
scopes. Instead, X-ray optics relies on grazing incidence mirrors. The con-
cept is that the incoming photons reﬂect against X-ray mirrors at very
small angles, relative to the surface, toward a focus. This setup requires the
mirrors to be nearly aligned with the incoming X-ray, resulting in a small
eﬀective area for each individual mirror, but also allows for multiple mir-
rors to be nested. This technology is used for several X-ray telescopes, such
as the Chandra X-Ray Observatory (CXO, Weisskopf et al. 2000, 2002),
NuSTAR (Harrison et al., 2013; Madsen et al., 2015), and XMM-Newton
(Jansen et al., 2001).

51

52

Chapter 5. X-Ray Astronomy

The two major X-ray observatories are Chandra and XMM-Newton.
Both telescopes have ﬁelds of view (FoVs) of approximately 0.2 square de-
grees. This is similar to the solid angle subtended by the full Moon, or
equivalently, 1/200,000 of the entire sky. The wide-ﬁeld all-sky survey in-
struments with focusing optics have FoVs of around 1 square degree, such as
ROSAT (Tr¨umper, 1983; Briel et al., 1994) and eROSITA (Predehl et al.,
2021).

The angular resolution of X-ray telescopes varies. Chandra oﬀers the
highest resolution of 0.7 arcsec, measured by the full width at half max-
imum (FWHM) of the PSF. The corresponding values are 6 arcsec for
XMM-Newton and 18 arcsec for NuSTAR. The half-power diameter (HPD)
is sometimes also mentioned in this context. In conjunction with the FWHM,
the HPD provides a handle on how broad the wings of the PSF are. It is
often the case that two diﬀerent physical limitations determine the width of
the core and the width of the wings of the PSF. The details of the PSF are
further complicated by a fairly signiﬁcant dependence on the oﬀ-axis angle
for most telescopes. The PSF is also slightly dependent on energy, but this
dependence is typically fairly weak. The oﬀ-axis eﬀects are only important
when observing oﬀ-axis sources or resolved targets that extend beyond the
on-axis region.

Another deﬁning property of X-ray telescopes is the eﬀective area. This
is on the order of 100–1000 cm2 for most telescopes.
Importantly, this
quantity is often a strongly varying function of energy.
It is also worth
pointing out that there might be discrete steps in the eﬀective area at certain
energies, often associated with atomic transition energies of the material
in the telescope. The calibration around these sharp edges could be less
reliable. In general, the telescopes have a higher eﬀective area toward lower
energies. Additionally, more photons are produced at lower energies by most
astrophysical sources, unless the spectrum is very hard. Therefore, the vast
majority of observed X-ray spectra show higher quality at lower energies.
Aside from the energy dependence, the eﬀective area also depends on the
oﬀ-axis angle, an eﬀect called vignetting. This is a relatively smooth eﬀect
and only aﬀects oﬀ-axis observations.

Dithering is also be performed in X-ray, similarly to UVOIR observa-
tions. The telescopes perform a continuous wobble during exposures, which
is automatically corrected for in the data reduction. This implies that im-
ages of astronomical sources wobble on the detector, an eﬀect that can be
used to verify the origin of sources (Bauer et al., 2017).

Alternative technologies to optics using grazing mirrors are coded mask
apertures and collimators. Collimators are simply narrowing the ﬁeld of
view to the detectors and are eﬀectively just “photon buckets”. This results
in no imaging capabilities. Coded masks rely on masking the detector in

5.2.

Instruments

53

such a way that it is possible to reconstruct the direction of the photon
to some extent and thus oﬀers low-resolution imaging. An advantage is
that the FoV and eﬀective areas are more scalable for telescopes using these
technologies.

5.2 Instruments

The primary detection technology used for X-rays is CCDs, but they are
quite diﬀerent from UVOIR CCDs. X-ray CCDs are typically sensitive to
photon energy with a spectral resolution of around 10 %. This means that
almost all X-ray images have an associated spectrum with each pixel. The
number of photons is often in the range of 100–10,000 and it is common to
quote the total number of photons in an observation.

Another diﬀerence is that the exposures are much shorter and many ex-
posures are combined to the total exposure time of an observation. However,
some CCDs use a triggered readout where the pixel is read each time a pho-
ton is registered. The individual exposure times are often called frame times
and vary from milliseconds to a few seconds. The cost of each readout is
that the detector is not registering new events during this time. This down-
time is often referred to as readout time or deadtime. The total exposure
time of most X-ray observations ranges from 10–100 ks.

A consequence of how X-ray CCDs are operated is that the raw data
of each observation is a list of photons, or events. There are three key
properties associated with each event: time, position, and energy. This
is in contrast with ordinary CCD exposures, which only produce images.
Images are technically 2D histograms of position integrated over time with
no energy information. For X-ray observations, it is fruitful to think of the
raw data as an event list, which is a table of all incoming photons and their
associated properties.
It is then from this list that images, spectra, and
light curves are produced.

Many of the X-ray observatories have several instruments and multiple
instruments could be operated simultaneously for each observation. Each
instrument can also have many modes, which are selected by the PI when
planning the observation. The speciﬁc set-up depends on the capabilities of
the observatory and what science goals are trying to be achieved. The main
diﬀerence between observing modes is often related to the brightness of the
source and what temporal resolution is required for the science goals.

It is also worth pointing out that the detector for every instrument
often consists of several CCDs (but entire detectors are often referred to as
CCDs). The implication for observers is that the mosaic of CCDs results
in chip gaps in the detector. Furthermore, there are often slight variations
between the individual CCDs. It is often recommended to only use data

54

Chapter 5. X-Ray Astronomy

from the CCD on which the science target is located. For example, the
background levels could vary slightly between the CCDs. In this case, the
background should be sampled from the same CCD as the source, even if
this CCD only constitutes a small fraction of the FoV.

Spectral information is not only provided by CCDs. Higher-resolution
spectroscopy in X-rays can be performed using either reﬂection or trans-
mission gratings. The idea is simply to insert a grating that diﬀracts the
incoming light in the optical path that is then read out by a CCD. The
resolving powers of gratings are on the order of several hundred. The draw-
back of gratings is that they lower the eﬀective area. Both XMM-Newton
and Chandra are equipped with grating spectrometers.

Another detector type for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is mi-
crocalorimeters, which are used as detectors instead of CCDs. The concept
is that an incident X-ray hits a pixel and deposits the energy into heat.
This temperature increase can then be accurately measured and gives spec-
tral resolutions comparable to that of the gratings. X-ray microcalorimeters
have been ﬂown on both Suzaku (Mitsuda et al., 2007) and Hitomi (ASTRO-
H, Takahashi et al. 2016), but were only operational for a very short time
due to accidents. The X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM,
formerly XARM and ASTRO-H2, Tashiro et al. 2018) is the replacement
mission of Hitomi and will be equipped with an X-ray microcalorimeter.

5.3 Data Reduction

Data reduction is the process of converting raw data to science products.
Standard analyses of a point source on-axis can in many cases perform an
almost default reduction, but the process can sometimes be much more com-
plicated. There are a number of decisions that need to be made; some of the
most important and common are described below. In general, the purpose
is to optimize the quality of the products with respect to the science goals.
The reduction itself is performed using custom software that is provided by
the telescope teams.

The ﬁrst step is to apply the latest calibration to the raw data. The data
from X-ray archives are at a low level, which allows future, more accurate
calibrations to be applied at the time of analysis. A ﬁlter based on the
pattern of each event is also applied. Pattern refers to the pixels hit by each
photon. Every photon could trigger one or several pixels, and this spatial
distribution is referred to as a pattern. The patterns are essentially small
pixel islands (often 3 × 3 or 5 × 5 pixels) and the shapes of these patterns
contain information about the event. The cleanest subset is usually those
where a photon only hit one pixel, but smaller clusters of triggered pixels

5.3. Data Reduction

55

are often accepted. Beyond a certain threshold, events are rejected and are
likely dominated by particle interactions or ﬂuorescence.

After the initial calibrations, most observations require a time ﬁlter to
exclude periods of high background. This type of background ﬂaring is very
characteristic and dominated by high-energy protons from the Sun. The
importance of this phenomenon depends on the orbit and whether or not it
is inside the protective magnetosphere of the Earth. For example, Chandra
is placed in an elliptical orbit with an eccentricity of 0.74 that brings it to
more than one-third of the distance to the Moon. The advantage of such an
orbit is that the telescope is eclipsed by the Earth for a much shorter fraction
of the total time and that longer continuous observations are possible. This
comes at the cost of exposure lost to proton ﬂares. It has been found that
30–40 % of the exposure time of the pn instrument on board XMM-Newton
is lost to ﬂares (Carter and Read, 2007).

Most observations require a source and a background region to be de-
ﬁned. The most common approach is to assume the background region to be
representative of the background in the source region and then subtracted
at some stage of the analysis. It is also important to note what fraction
of all photons of a point source that is expected within the source region.
This fraction is sometimes referred to as encircled energy and only applies
to point sources.

Filters can also be applied to restrict the energy range used for the
analysis.
If light curves are produced or ﬂuxes estimated directly from
the data, a number of instrumental corrections need to be applied. This
converts the observed photon count rate to a ﬂux in physical units. A more
careful conversion requires a model for the spectrum and is performed in the
spectral analysis. This is are more complicated and is described in Section
5.4 below.

If the accuracy of the timestamps is important, a barycentric correction
needs to be applied (Eastman et al., 2010). This corrects for the accelerating
motion of the telescope. It shifts the time of arrival of all photons to the
time at which they would have been observed at the Solar System center
of mass. This level of accuracy is practically only needed for analyses of
pulsars. It is worth pointing out that it is notoriously easy for unexpected
problems to corrupt the data for this type of high-resolution timing analysis.
There are a number of instrumental aspects that the observer needs
to be aware of. It is well-established that the calibration of X-ray instru-
ments are accurate to 5–10 % (Plucinsky et al., 2008, 2017; Ishida et al.,
2011; Tsujimoto et al., 2011; Kettula et al., 2013; Read et al., 2014; Mad-
sen et al., 2017). Both the absolute magnitude and the spectral shapes are
uncertain. Most analyses do not suﬀer signiﬁcantly from this, either due to
a low number of photons or because only one instrument is used. Instru-

56

Chapter 5. X-Ray Astronomy

ments on board the same observatory tend to be better cross-calibrated,
but these uncertainties should be kept in mind when analyzing X-ray data.
Instrumental calibrations tend to improve over time, but sometimes the in-
strumental properties also evolve as the instruments age. It is useful to be
aware of this, as it has caused confusion in the past.

There are also other types of instrumental artifacts or observational
limitations. These are obviously non-astronomical in all but very few cases.
An example is a temporary failure of the aspect reconstruction, where all
sources shift by an arbitrary amount for a short time. This is not obvious
in the time-integrated image if the failure duration is very short relative to
the entire observation. Sometimes a pixel (or a cluster of pixels) ﬂares and
continuously triggers. This is not always ﬁltered by the data reduction and
will leave an artifact in the ﬁnal product. Another possible problem is leak-
age from radioactive sources that are installed on board as absolute energy
calibrators, which could introduce spectral lines. Finally, bright sources
outside the ﬁeld of view can leak into the frame, causing characteristic arcs
of emission. All of these problems can be identiﬁed by diﬀerent procedures,
for example, by comparing with the known PSF shape, inspecting the inte-
grated and time-resolved images, and monitoring the suspect source relative
to other sources in the FoV. The issues mentioned above are not exhaustive
and this particular aspect of the data analysis often relies on the experience
of the researcher.

5.4 Spectral Analysis

This section describes parts of the data preparation related to the spectra
and how spectral analyses usually are performed. The aim of the spectral
analysis is to compare one or several models with the data and ﬁnd associ-
ated parameter values. A software package called XSPEC (Arnaud, 1996)
is used for a majority of all X-ray spectral analyses. This facilitates the
management of the diﬀerent data ﬁles and includes most of the standard
optimization and statistics functions.

The response matrix ﬁle (RMF) and ancillary response ﬁle (ARF) are
critical for the spectral analysis. The RMF describes the probability that an
incoming photon is detected at a given energy as a function of true photon
energy. This has the important implication that the true underlying photon
distribution cannot be recovered exactly. The incoming photon spectrum
undergoes a convolution by the instrument response, which is modeled by
the RMF. This convolution is lossy in the sense that the original spectrum
cannot be uniquely determined if only the convolved spectrum is known.
The spectrum convolved by the instrument response is sometimes referred

5.4. Spectral Analysis

57

to as folded or forward-folded spectrum. The ARF is simpler and only con-
tains the eﬀective area as a function of energy. This implies that it carries
all corrections associated with normalizing to the physical area, such as the
encircled energy and oﬀ-axis angle. A number of less important factors
contribute to the RMF and ARF to varying degrees, for example, the tem-
perature of the instrument and the time since launch. It is worth pointing
out that spectra often are presented in the instrument space, meaning that
the spectra are folded by the instrument response. This means that many
features, which are purely instrumental, are introduced into the spectrum.
Typically, there are some steps or wiggles due to the varying eﬀective area,
and all folded spectra tend to show a decline toward higher energies due to
the decreasing eﬀective area.

The most common method of creating a spectrum from the event list
is to bin the events, creating an energy histogram of the photons.
It is
common to choose a binning of ∼25 photons per bin. This is to have a
suﬃcient number of photons to apply Gaussian statistics. However, if there
are too few photons, it might be necessary to analyze the unbinned data
(often implemented as binning to 1 photon per bin for technical reasons). In
this case, the analysis needs to employ Poissonian statistics, often referred
to as the C statistic in XSPEC (Cash, 1979). Admittedly, some aspects
of the statistics are conventionally treated somewhat sloppily. However,
this is rarely important because the scientiﬁc conclusions are typically not
sensitive to eﬀects on the magnitude of those introduced by the statistical
simpliﬁcations. This is also partly to facilitate the analysis, and partly
to follow previous studies, allowing for comparisons. In light of this, it is
worth stressing that marginal features should not be immediately trusted.
Not only does one need to carefully evaluate their statistical signiﬁcance,
but also beware of instrumental, observational, and modeling pitfalls.

The XSPEC package contains a large number of spectral components,
which are combined to create suitable models. It is common to use one or
a few additive source components representing diﬀerent physical emission
sources.
In addition to these additive components, most models use one
or two multiplicative absorption components. In this context, multiplica-
tive means that they are multiplicative functions of energy that need to
modify an underlying additive component. These model the attenuation
by the ISM in the Milky Way along the line of sight, and possibly absorp-
tion in the local environment of the source. XSPEC then computes the
source spectrum from the combined model, folds it through the modeled
instrument response (RMF and ARF), and compares it to the observed,
background-subtracted source spectrum. The model is ﬁtted by iterating
using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (Levenberg, 1944; Marquardt,
1963) to ﬁnd the best-ﬁt parameter values. Statistical uncertainties are

58

Chapter 5. X-Ray Astronomy

obtained by varying the parameters until a threshold increase of the ﬁt
statistic. The scientiﬁc analysis can then be performed based on the results
from the spectral ﬁts.

Summary of the Attached
Papers

In this chapter, I aim to provide less technical summaries of the attached
papers. The idea is to bridge the gap between the introductory part of
this thesis and the papers. The following summaries are, therefore, more
conceptual and explanatory, while being less quantitative.

6.1 Paper I

The compact remnant that is expected to have been formed by SN 1987A
has not yet been detected despite more than 30 years of searches. The for-
mation of a compact object is a critical prediction of CCSN theory and SN
1987A oﬀers the best possibility for us to directly conﬁrm this. Since it has
not yet been detected, it is important to use the available observations to
constrain the remaining possibilities. Of particular interest are the remain-
ing possibilities for a neutron star because this scenario is favored by most
theories.

We used recent observations in millimeter, NIR, optical, UV, and X-
rays to achieve the most complete coverage possible. One of the major
challenges was to model how the emission from a compact object could be
reprocessed. This is important because it is likely that much of the original
emission from a compact remnant would be absorbed. However, the energy
must still escape the ejecta in some form. To model these interactions,
we use the X-ray absorption model from Paper II as well as a much more
uncertain dust model based on previous research.

59

60

Chapter 6. Summary of the Attached Papers

The complete physical model constrains accretion, pulsar wind activity,
and thermal surface emission from a neutron star. The accretion limits
are fairly constraining and rule out many of the theoretical predictions of
fallback accretion. The limits on the magnetic ﬁeld strength and rotation
period are more diﬃcult to interpret because of the lack of accurate theoret-
ical predictions. We ﬁnd that certain dust properties are likely required just
for the thermal surface emission to remain undetected, but this conclusion
relies on a number of assumptions. This means that a neutron star remains
a possibility, but the remaining parameter space is relatively small.

A number of future facilities will provide interesting observations that
have a chance of detecting a neutron star. Of particular interest are the
next generation of ground-based optical and NIR telescopes that will have
unprecedented angular resolutions and sensitivities, and future ALMA ob-
servations of the thermal dust emission. Finally, we simply note that a
black hole is fully consistent with observations and that this scenario is,
unfortunately, very diﬃcult to verify observationally.

6.2 Paper II

This paper focuses on the X-ray absorption in young SNRs using 3D mod-
els from neutrino-driven SN explosion simulations. Young in this context
is from ∼100 days to around 1000 years, but these numbers sensitively de-
pend on how much the ejecta interact with the environment. The aim was
primarily to study the X-ray absorption but the models are valid to beyond
1 MeV. In contrast to the other papers, we use the SN simulations to model
how much absorption we expect to the center of the remnants. Basically,
this means that we use the prediction as a model rather than directly testing
the accuracy of the model. The absorption to the center is of particular in-
terest because the compact remnant left by a CCSN explosion should reside
relatively close to the center.

One of the motivations for this study was that a more detailed model
was required to model the X-ray optical depth to the center of SN 1987A
for Paper I. We ﬁnd that the X-ray depth to the center is expected to be
very high in SN 1987A at the current epoch. It is unlikely that the compact
object that was created will be observed directly in X-rays over the next
few decades. Furthermore, we apply the model to the CCO in Cas A, for
which the importance of ejecta absorption has been discussed but we ﬁnd
that it is negligible. This paper also investigated how much variance that
can be introduced by asymmetries, diﬀerent progenitors, and diﬀerent SN
types. We also conclude that the absorption properties are relatively similar
for both the BSG and RSG progenitors. The diﬀerent density proﬁles only
have a minor impact on the absorption. However, the total mass is a very

6.3. Paper III

61

important factor. Not only does more material imply higher absorption,
but it also results in lower expansion velocities and tends to smooth out
any asymmetries. We stress that these conclusions rely on a limited number
of models and the assumptions that go into the SN simulations and their
progenitors.

6.3 Paper III

In this paper, we compare the same 3D models (as in Paper II) based on
neutrino-driven SN simulations with early X-ray and gamma-ray observa-
tions of SN 1987A. The early emission refers to the direct and reprocessed
emission that originates from the radioactive decay of elements that were
synthesized in the explosion. The important physical processes for the ra-
diation transfer are Compton scattering and photoabsorption. The general
behavior is that a photon is produced by a radioactive decay with a typ-
ical energy of around 1 MeV. In this energy regime, Compton scattering
dominates and photoabsorption is negligible. Compton scattering does not
destroy the photon but the photon energy is reduced and scattered into a
new propagation direction. A large number of interactions and energy re-
ductions slowly shift the photons into the low-energy regime where photoab-
sorption becomes increasingly important. Photoabsorption starts becoming
important below 100 keV but the exponential dependence causes a sharp
cutoﬀ around 20 keV. This means that each photon is randomly scattered
around inside the ejecta and the question is essentially how much energy
the photon manages to escape with or if it is absorbed.

From the models, it is possible to perform computer simulations of the
photon propagation. We compare these predictions with observations of SN
1987A during the ﬁrst 1000 days. There were numerous space-based and
balloon-borne instruments that performed measurements. They provided
spectra and light curves in the 10–200 keV range, which captures the emis-
sion that has scattered several times before escaping. There are also more
limited data available around 1 MeV that shows the temporal evolution of
the ﬂuxes of the direct line emission, primarily the two most important lines
at 847 and 1238 keV of 56Co.

We ﬁnd that the model predictions agree well with observed data. There
are minor indications that slightly more mixing of the fastest trace amounts
of nickel is needed and that the bulk of the nickel is moving away from us
faster than what is found in the models. The diﬀerent non-stripped RSG
and BSG progenitors show very similar emission features. The stripped-
envelope Type IIb model evolves much faster and is much brighter because of
its lower ejecta mass and higher expansion velocities. The asymmetries and
3D structures primarily aﬀect the magnitude of the ﬂux but the shapes of the

62

Chapter 6. Summary of the Attached Papers

spectra and light curves are rather insensitive to the viewing direction. We
also ﬁnd that the progenitor surface metallicity determines the low-energy
photoabsorption X-ray cutoﬀ, which potentially allows for constraints on
the progenitor metallicity. Future observations of the X-ray continuum with
NuSTAR are able to detect SNe up to 3–10 Mpc and INTEGRAL/SPI can
measure the direct line emission from SNe within 0.2–2 Mpc.

6.4 Paper IV

This paper is a search for SN SBOs. SBOs are short ﬂashes produced when
the explosion shock breaks the progenitor surface. The SBO leads the main
SN emission, which is when SNe are detected. Therefore, SBOs need to
serendipitously occur within the FoV of an X-ray telescope that is observing
another target. For reference, typical XMM-Newton images contain several
tens of sources. The SBO would then need to later be identiﬁed as a peculiar
background source and studied further. Based on theoretical predictions, a
signiﬁcant number of SN SBOs were predicted to have been serendipitously
observed by XMM-Newton. Despite the predictions, this paper is the ﬁrst
systematic search for SBOs.

We use all available XMM-Newton data between 2000 and 2019, result-
ing in a total exposure time of approximately 160 Ms (∼5 years) after all
ﬁltering criteria. We develop a custom algorithm that identiﬁes X-ray tran-
sients in general. This search would, in principle, ﬁnd any X-ray transient
that is clearly identiﬁable as a transient within an individual observation.
The upper limit is the observation duration, which ranges from 20 to 140 ks.
The lower limit is the temporal resolution of XMM-Newton, which limits the
search sensitivity to transients longer than ∼1 s. Even though the search
algorithm is quite general, all 12 (potentially) extragalactic transients we
discovered are at least reasonable SN SBO candidates. All candidates are
spectrally soft and have timescales ranging from 100 s to 10 ks, in reasonable
agreement with SN SBO predictions.

To complement the X-ray data, we use available optical survey data to
identify host galaxies and constrain the redshift. This is only possible for
some of the sources and can only be done to a varying degree of conﬁdence.
From the X-ray and the optical data, we infer physical properties of the SN
and its progenitor. The best candidates are fully consistent with theoretical
predictions for a typical SBO from a BSG. This is the type predicted to be
most commonly serendipitously observed. A few other candidates require
lesser modiﬁcations to match the BSG SBO predictions. In this context,
this implies corrections due to asymmetries or CSM. Both are expected
to some degree and it is natural to expect a few such examples within our
sample. There are also indications that two or three of the candidates might

6.5. Paper V

63

be of even more exotic origin, and a few might be contaminating ﬂares from
foreground dwarf stars. The quality of the available data prevents us from
robustly determining the true origins of many of the transients.

Finally, we note that our sample of X-ray transients is important to aid
identiﬁcations of future serendipitously discovered X-ray transients by, for
example, eROSITA. If transients are discovered in real-time, deep multi-
wavelength follow-up observations can be triggered, which would allow us
to fully capitalize on these rare opportunities.

6.5 Paper V

Paper V is a detailed spectral and temporal X-ray analysis of SN 1987A.
The focus is primarily toward the higher end of the X-ray spectrum covered
solely by NuSTAR, a waveband of SN 1987A little studied before. This part
of the X-ray spectrum holds important information about potential cosmic
ray acceleration and emission from a neutron star. Lower X-ray energies
have been extensively studied and are dominated by thermal emission origi-
nating from the shocks between the ejecta and CSM. Many lines are present
in the spectrum, which robustly show that the emission must be thermal
since no other hypothesized components would produce any lines. This
bright thermal emission could hide other, non-thermal components, which
is the main motivation for studying the NuSTAR energy range. However,
to properly model the NuSTAR spectra, we need a wide spectrum covering
the entire X-ray range. Therefore, we also include XMM-Newton data in
addition to the NuSTAR data.

By analyzing the entire X-ray spectrum and its evolution, we conclude
that there is no evidence for any substantial non-thermal contribution. The
X-ray spectrum is adequately described by three thermal shock components
of diﬀerent temperatures. The need for three diﬀerent components is not
surprising due to the complex structure of the CSM. It is primarily a con-
sequence of the very diﬀerent densities in the dense ER and the low-density
high-latitude regions. On the other hand, if a non-thermal component is
present and contributing signiﬁcantly, it would need to be harder and start
dominating toward higher energies. Observationally, this would mean that
the spectrum extends to higher energies and that ﬁtted thermal models re-
quire higher temperatures. We do not observe this, and even if this was
observed, a faint thermal contribution at higher energies is expected from
the reverse shock. Such a contribution would need to be disentangled from
non-thermal emission from relativistic electrons or a neutron star. With
limited data quality, these components would likely be challenging to sep-
arate. However, as mentioned above, the observed spectrum does not re-
quire an additional high-energy component. The temporal evolution of the

64

Chapter 6. Summary of the Attached Papers

X-ray spectrum also shows no indication of multiple components. For these
reasons, we conclude that there is no need to invoke additional emission
processes.

Largely separate from the main focus, we also study a number of radioac-
tive lines. The radioactive lines produced by radioactive decay are easier
to interpret and infer physical properties from since they are less aﬀected
by modeling assumptions. Importantly, given that the decay timescales are
known, the emission is proportional to isotope mass, which is otherwise
hard to constrain and serves as an important diagnostics for SN explosion
simulations. Lines from 44Ti and 55Fe are produced within the observed
X-ray interval. Two lines from 44Ti are detected and we ﬁnd similar results
as previous analyses of these lines, whereas we provide an upper limit on
the 55Fe mass.

Future NuSTAR observations are important complements to the more
sensitive low-energy instruments. The unique capabilities of NuSTAR are
critical to answer some of the most interesting future questions concerning
possible new processes that are present in SN 1987A.

Conclusions and Future
Prospects

In this chapter, I take the opportunity to connect all the papers included in
this thesis and discuss conclusions on a higher level than what is done within
the individual papers. This will highlight some of the overlaps between the
papers and where they support and connect to each other. This chapter
also touches upon connections to a few subsequent papers by other authors,
primarily related to the compact object in SN 1987A.

I also outline possibilities for future studies and their relevance to active
research questions. Additionally, I brieﬂy mention some short studies, which
are often inspired by the papers but not published. These are predominantly
very quick analyses that were worth brieﬂy exploring, but not part of a
complete paper. Some parts of this chapter are also more speculative.

7.1 The Compact Object in SN 1987A

Paper I is a comprehensive study of constraints on the compact object in
SN 1987A. It is comprehensive in the sense that it uses data from all wave-
lengths, as well as investigates the reprocessing between diﬀerent wave-
bands. The reprocessing relies on a large number of underlying physical
phenomena. These are critical to consider since any hypothesis needs to be
physically consistent with all available data.

A prediction in Paper I is that the thermal emission from the surface of
the neutron star is photoabsorbed, re-emitted in UVOIR, subsequently dust
absorbed, and ﬁnally re-emitted as thermal dust emission at millimeter-
wavelengths (several hundred GHz). In the paper, we conclude that this

65

66

Chapter 7. Conclusions and Future Prospects

is the most likely scenario for the neutron star in SN 1987A. Cigan et al.
(2019) later reported the presence of a localized hotspot in the millimeter
dust emission of SN 1987A observed by ALMA. However, the signiﬁcance of
this excess is limited by the poor data quality. Therefore, it is not necessarily
a conﬁrmation of the original prediction in Paper I, but rather a possible
hint, which is consistent with the prediction. In particular, the millimeter-
excess was only observed at one frequency, which implies that the total
energy is challenging to constrain. A theoretical, follow-up study by Page
et al. (2020) found that the ALMA blob matches predictions for thermal
emission of a cooling neutron star. However, I remain cautious and argue
that it is important to obtain higher-quality ALMA images of the dust in
the future. This is necessary to draw ﬁrm conclusions about the thermal
emission from a neutron star in SN 1987A.

In contrast to Paper I, Paper V focuses solely on X-rays from SN 1987A,
but investigates a number of diﬀerent possible origins of the X-ray emission.
One potential emission component origin is a neutron star, in the form of a
PWN. From the spectral analysis, we conclude that there is no observational
support to include such a component in addition to the dominant thermal
component. This is further motivated by the multi-wavelength picture from
Paper I, as well as the modeled X-ray absorption properties of Paper II.
However, an independent analysis by Greco et al. (2021) using similar data
sets ﬁnds that the X-ray spectrum cannot be explained by purely thermal
processes and require a neutron star contribution (see also Section 4.4.3 of
Greco 2021). This is in contrast to our conclusions in Paper V, but Paper V
only ﬁnds no support for a neutron star contribution. Essentially, we argue
that invoking a neutron star would be to add an additional component to a
model that already ﬁts the data. This means that a neutron star is formally
consistent with the X-ray data, albeit considered unnecessary by us based
purely on the X-ray analysis in Paper V.

Importantly, strong reasons against a neutron star X-ray contribution
come from Papers I and II. This is because adding a neutron star contri-
bution in X-rays aﬀects the complete physical model across all wavebands.
From Paper II, we know that practically all emission below 10 keV from
a neutron star must be absorbed. This absorption does not apply to the
thermal X-ray emission because it is produced by interactions with the ISM
“outside of” the ejecta. Consequently, if a neutron star is to produce any
meaningful fraction of the observed X-ray emission, it would also serve as
a substantial energy injection into the ejecta. This then connects to the
energy budget discussion in Paper I, where we conclude that the balance
between total energy output of the central ejecta in SN 1987A is balanced
by the known contribution from the decay of radioactive isotopes. Only
very little room is left for an additional power source in SN 1987A. It is

7.2. Pulsars in Young Supernova Remnants

67

from all the arguments above, we favor the purely thermal model for the
X-ray emission and argue that the only tentative indication of the compact
object is the localized ALMA emission.

Unfortunately,

it will likely be challenging to improve this situation
much within the foreseeable future. The most promising avenues are fu-
ture ALMA observations or the next-generation ground-based UVOIR tele-
scopes. ALMA could potentially provide suﬃciently improved data quality
to allow more robust conclusions, but this depends to some extent on the
spatial distribution of the dust around the neutron star. Future UVOIR
observations will oﬀer signiﬁcant technical improvements, but will still be
largely limited by the presence of dust along the line of sight. Any detection
in X-rays is, unfortunately, probably unlikely. From Paper II, we ﬁnd an
optical depth of 3 at 2 keV in about the year 2070. This implies that any
soft X-ray component will likely be completely absorbed for a long time to
come, and a hard X-ray contribution is not expected. To summarize, we
likely need to be quite lucky to obtain any convincing evidence of a neutron
star in SN 1987A in the near future.

7.2 Pulsars in Young Supernova Remnants

Paper II presents a model for photoabsorption and Compton scattering in
young SNRs. Young in this context is approximately several hundred years
or possibly more, depending on the individual SN conditions. We primarily
used the model for the analysis of the SN 1987A X-ray spectrum. However,
the model is general and applies to most other SNe (possibly with some
scaling factors) and to photon energies of a few MeV.

In this section, we discuss how this model could be used in searches for
extragalactic PWN (beyond the satellites of the Milky Way). Even though
these objects have been suggested to be detectable (Bahcall et al., 1970;
Perna and Stella, 2004; Medvedev and Poutanen, 2013), none have yet been
detected. This is in principle analogous to the SN 1987A neutron star search
in Paper I. The strategy here is to go to larger distances and search for
brighter objects (Figure 3.4), instead of searching very deeply in the closest
SNe.
Identifying a young PWN would provide valuable insight into the
birth properties of neutron stars, which are currently poorly constrained.
It would also potentially allow for studies of the evolution of young pulsars.
In addition to studies of the pulsar and its surroundings, the properties
of the neutron star are also an important diagnostic for the SN explosion
mechanism. In some cases, the neutron star could play a critical role in the
explosion. This would be a very important detection, especially if the SN
itself was observed.

68

Chapter 7. Conclusions and Future Prospects

The paper shows that ejecta are opaque at below 10 keV X-rays for
several decades. This means that any nearby SN that is old enough to be
transparent for soft X-ray likely would not have been detected at the time
of explosion. Reasonable completeness of SN surveys even to the closest
tens of galaxies was only achieved within the last few decades. Nearby
in this context is typically 2–10 Mpc. Within this distance, it is realistic
for current X-ray telescopes to detect bright PWNe while the number of
potential sources is suﬃciently high. The expected SN rate is approximately
1 per year within 10 Mpc (Botticella et al., 2012; Horiuchi et al., 2013; Xiao
and Eldridge, 2015). Paper II also shows that the intrinsic asymmetries
could signiﬁcantly aﬀect the amount of absorption, further motivating a
larger sample of targets.

Observationally, there are a few diﬀerent approaches to this problem.
The ﬁrst option is to search at the locations of known SNe detected within
the last 100 years (the ﬁrst detected extragalactic SN was SN 1885A in the
Andromeda Galaxy). The sensitivity of soft X-ray telescopes to a centrally
located X-ray source would only be meaningful for SNe older than at least
a few decades. Only relatively few (∼30) such objects are known and the
quality of the available data of the SNe themselves is typically low. Studies
of the late-time X-ray properties of these SNe have not found any clear
evidence for the presence of a PWN (Perna et al., 2008; Soria and Perna,
2008; Patnaude et al., 2011; Ramakrishnan and Dwarkadas, 2020).

Another approach is to blindly search among the X-ray sources in nearby
galaxies. The idea would be to distinguish young PWNe by the characteris-
tic strong spectral absorption signatures predicted in Paper II. Further clues
could be obtained from the temporal evolution, either within the observa-
tion or between epochs if the ﬁeld has been observed several times. Many
X-ray sources are variable to some degree, whereas a PWN is expected to be
practically constant, similar to the Crab (Kirsch et al., 2005). I attempted
to identify such sources by quickly scanning archival XMM-Newton data,
but failed to ﬁnd any convincing candidate. The main diﬃculty is to disen-
tangle PWNe from other strong X-ray sources. The primary contaminants
are ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), which are likely mostly accreting
neutron star binaries (e.g. Bachetti et al. 2014). There are more than 300
candidate ULXs in nearby galaxies (Earnshaw et al., 2019), and the ex-
pected number of bright pulsars is much lower (Medvedev and Poutanen,
2013). Separating these sources, therefore, requires more careful work, but
the prospects for identifying interesting candidates are promising.

Finally, it is possible to focus on data above 10 keV. These are less
aﬀected by absorption, which primarily allows for deeper constraints during
the ﬁrst few years to decades when the ejecta are photoabsorption thick
but Compton thin. However, the drawback is that hard X-ray instruments

7.3. Magnetar-driven Superluminous Supernovae

69

(primarily NuSTAR) are less sensitive.
I inspected NuSTAR images of
nearby galaxies but found no candidate PWNe. This is not very surprising
since very few sources are detected above 10 keV by NuSTAR. However, a
population of young, bright PWNe is expected and will likely be identiﬁed
at some point in the future.

7.3 Magnetar-driven Superluminous

Supernovae

Paper II can also be used when searching for magnetars in Type I SLSNe.
This is the subcategory of SNe which is hypothesized to be powered by
magnetars. Even though they are called magnetars, they are fundamentally
the same as other neutron stars. The choice of speciﬁc term is primarily
determined by context, neutron star parameters, and if pulsations have been
observed. The terminology is, unfortunately, not consistent.

Magnetars in this context are very similar to the pulsars described in
the section above, but with faster spins and higher magnetic ﬁeld strengths
(Nicholl et al., 2017; Blanchard et al., 2020; Hsu et al., 2021). Observation-
ally, a SLSN is observed, and the presence of a magnetar is inferred from
the optical observations of the SLSN. Therefore, SLSNe might signal the
birth of the most extreme neutron stars, eﬀectively pointing us to the most
suitable candidates for deep X-ray searches (Figure 3.4). These SNe are
very rare, but also very bright. This implies that the observed population is
located at distances greater than 100 Mpc. These neutron stars still remain
potentially observable despite the large distances because the magnetars
are exceptionally powerful for a few years (Figure 3.5). The combination
of a fast rotation and strong magnetic ﬁeld is suggested to be what makes
SLSNe superluminous.

There are no direct X-ray detections of the central magnetar (Margutti
et al., 2018), except for one tentative candidate (Levan et al., 2013). Pre-
dictions for X-ray observations are complicated by the additional energy
input from a magnetar. This is because the energy injection aﬀects the
hydrodynamics (Chen et al., 2016; Blondin and Chevalier, 2017) and the
ionization state of the gas (Metzger et al., 2014). A fully self-consistent
model would incorporate these factors in three dimensions, in addition to
the progenitor properties and explosion physics. This is computationally
unfeasible and no model accounts for all these factors simultaneously. Our
models in Paper II capture the hydrodynamics driven by the neutrino heat-
ing self-consistently in three dimensions. By looking at separate studies
of the magnetar feedback in the literature, we could perform speculative
corrections to our models in an attempt to correct for these eﬀects. This

70

Chapter 7. Conclusions and Future Prospects

has been done and the models have been used to better plan for future
observations of X-ray observations of engine-driven transients.

An important consequence of the high luminosities of these magnetars is
that the neutron star energy is drained much more quickly. Fundamentally,
the only power source in this simpliﬁed model is the rotational energy of
the neutron star. This implies that the magnetar fades on timescales of a
few years. We note that the timescale depends sensitively on the magnetic
ﬁeld strength, which basically determines how quickly the rotational energy
is being tapped. The short timescales lead to a trade-oﬀ between the mag-
netar decaying and the absorption decreasing when planning observations.
Therefore, it might be advantageous to observe above 10 keV where the ab-
sorption is lower, implying that observations could be performed at earlier
epochs. The hard X-ray instruments are less sensitive but this could be
outweighed by the higher source luminosities.

I brieﬂy explored the prospects for diﬀerent X-ray observations by insert-
ing a magnetar model into modiﬁed versions of the SN models presented in
Paper II. This set-up is very similar to the analysis performed in Paper III,
but with the radioactive sources replaced by a central magnetar. This is
highly simpliﬁed, but the results indicated that NuSTAR could be more
sensitive than soft X-ray instruments at ∼300 d. The optimal epoch for an
observation would still depend on the magnetar properties, primarily the
magnetic ﬁeld strength.

7.4 Supernova Asymmetries

Papers III and IV touch upon the asymmetries of SN explosions and SN
simulations. These papers serve as tests for the set of simulations used for
the SN models presented in Paper II (see also Jerkstrand et al. 2020 and
Utrobin et al. 2021). The early X-ray and gamma-ray properties studied in
Paper III show that some models could produce a suﬃcient level of asym-
metries, especially if a suitable viewing angle was chosen. The connection
between the SBO candidates in Paper IV and the SN asymmetries is more
speculative, but they indicate that asymmetries might signiﬁcantly lengthen
the duration of the burst compared to spherically symmetric models. This
is also seen directly from the SN simulations (Wongwathanarat et al., 2015).
All things considered, the 3D SN simulations models based on neutron-
heating (Paper II) seem to slightly underestimate the level of asymmetries.
It is at least clear that none of the models studied in Paper III overestimated
the level of mixing. A possible factor that could introduce stronger asym-
metries is the properties of the progenitor. 3D simulations of oxygen-shell
burning just prior to core collapse show that large-scale, large-amplitude
asymmetries develop (Yadav et al., 2020; Yoshida et al., 2021). These may

7.5. X-Ray Transients

71

have important implications for the SN explosion and it will be interesting to
compare SN simulations based on 3D progenitor models with observations.
It is also possible that other factors contribute in addition to the progeni-
tor structure, such as late-time heating by radioactive decay (Gabler et al.,
2021) or energy injection from the compact object (Blondin and Chevalier,
2017). Qualitatively, any additional factors are likely further amplifying any
asymmetries, which would help alleviate the tensions between simulations
and observations.

7.5 X-Ray Transients

In Paper IV, we searched for SN SBOs and found 12 candidates. In the
paper, we primarily focused on how they compared to predictions for SN
SBOs and discussed their implications in this context. Even though they
are good candidates, the entire sample most likely contains objects of other
physical origins.
Interestingly, if these sources are extragalactic but not
SBO related, they would be even more exotic transients (Jonker et al.,
2013; Glennie et al., 2015; Bauer et al., 2017; Xue et al., 2019). It is hard
to draw ﬁrm conclusions solely based on the X-ray data and we are looking
to obtain optical observations of the host galaxies to clarify their nature.

The results of Paper IV are also useful for predicting the number of
transients in other X-ray archives and for future telescopes. In principle, it
is also possible to estimate the volumetric rates of these X-ray transients, but
this is more challenging and requires further study. In the paper, we brieﬂy
mention that the expected detection rate for eROSITA is two transients
similar to the SBO candidates per year. eROSITA launched on 2019 July 13
and started its science survey on 2019 December 13. So far, no comparable
X-ray transient has been published, but we believe that candidates likely will
be reported in the near future. The predicted rate should be fairly robust
since the capabilities of eROSITA are comparable to those of XMM-Newton.
There might also be undiscovered X-ray transients in the archives of
other X-ray telescopes (Sapir et al., 2013). Yang et al. (2019) searched 19
Ms (0.6 years) of Chandra data, but only recovered two previously published
transients (Bauer et al., 2017; Xue et al., 2019). This is only a fraction of
the entire Chandra archive and more interesting objects are likely yet to
be discovered. I have slightly modiﬁed the search script used in Paper IV
to run on NuSTAR data, but found nothing. This was just a quick search
to look for obvious objects of interest in 110 Ms (3.5 years) of data. The
ROSAT archive could potentially also be worth searching systematically.
Even though the telescope operated during the 90s, its ability to detect
bright transients is not much worse than that of XMM-Newton. Previous
ROSAT searches focused on diﬀerent types of transients (Vikhlinin, 1998;

72

Chapter 7. Conclusions and Future Prospects

Greiner et al., 2000), and the 33 Ms (1 year) exposure of pointed Position
Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) observations could potentially hold
undiscovered transients.

The discussion so far, as well as Paper IV, solely focuses on intra-
observation transients. In practice, this limits the duration of the transients
to about ∼10 hours. Another avenue is to search for variability between dif-
ferent observation epochs, an area that also appears to be under-explored.
This could potentially ﬁnd phenomena related to active galactic nuclei, tidal
disruption events, and certain exotic explosive transients (e.g. Levan et al.
2013; Lin et al. 2017; Margutti et al. 2019).

7.6 Concluding Remarks

In summary, this thesis presents new results primarily based on X-ray obser-
vations of CCSNe. The overarching theme is to compare new observations
with theoretical developments. Speciﬁcally, we have investigated predic-
tions based on recent 3D neutrino-driven SN explosion simulations. These
models can also be used to tackle other, yet unanswered questions, some of
which are outlined above. We have shown the usefulness of some less ex-
plored avenues for analyzing CCSNe using X-ray observations. Many of the
areas studied in this thesis stand to gain signiﬁcantly from future research,
upcoming X-ray missions, and the possible occurrence of a nearby CCSN.
