My dear Frodo:
You asked me once...
...if I had told you everything
there was to know about my adventures.
And while I can honestly say
I have told you the truth...
...I may not have told you all of it.
I am old now, Frodo.
I'm not the same Hobbit I once was.
I think it is time for you to know...
...what really happened.
It began long ago...
...in a land far away to the east...
...the like of which you will not find
in the world today.
There was the city of Dale.
Its markets known far and wide.
Full of the bounties of vine and vale.
Peaceful and prosperous.
For this city lay before the doors
of the greatest kingdom in Middle-earth:
Erebor.
Stronghold of Thror,
King Under the Mountain.
Mightiest of the Dwarf Lords.
Thror ruled with utter surety...
...never doubting his house would endure...
...for his line lay secure
in the lives of his son...
...and grandson.
Ah, Frodo. Erebor.
Built deep within the mountain itself...
...the beauty of this
fortress city was legend.
Its wealth lay in the earth...
...in precious gems hewn from rock...
...and in great seams of gold...
...running like rivers through stone.
The skill of the Dwarves was unequaled...
...fashioning objects of great beauty...
...out of diamond, emerald,
ruby and sapphire.
Ever they delved deeper,
down into the dark.
And that is where they found it.
The Heart of the Mountain.
The Arkenstone.
Thror named it "The King's Jewel."
He took it as a sign,
a sign that his right to rule was divine.
All would pay homage to him.
Even the great Elven King, Thranduil.
But the years of peace and plenty
were not to last.
Slowly the days turned sour...
...and the watchful nights closed in.
Thror's love of gold had grown too fierce.
A sickness had begun to grow within him.
It was a sickness of the mind.
And where sickness thrives...
...bad things will follow.
The first they heard
was a noise like a hurricane...
...coming down from the North.
The pines on the mountain
creaked and cracked in the hot, dry wind.
Balin, sound the alarm.
Call out the guard. Do it now!
What is it?
Dragon.
Dragon!
He was a firedrake from the North.
Smaug had come.
Such wanton death was dealt that day.
For this city of Men was nothing to Smaug.
His eye was set on another prize.
For dragons covet gold
with a dark and fierce desire.
Aah!
No!
Come on.
Erebor was lost.
For a dragon will guard his plunder...
...as long as he lives.
Run for your lives!
Ah! Help us!
Thranduil would not risk the lives of his
kin against the wrath of the dragon.
No help came from the Elves that day...
...nor any day since.
Robbed of their homeland...
- -the Dwarves of Erebor
wandered the wilderness...
...a once mighty people brought low.
The young Dwarf prince took work
where he could find it...
...laboring in the villages of Men.
But always he remembered...
...the mountain smoke beneath the moon...
...the trees like torches blazing bright.
For he had seen dragon fire in the sky...
...and a city turned to ash.
And he never forgave...
...and he never forgot.
That, my dear Frodo, is where I come in.
For, quite by chance,
and the will of a Wizard...
...fate decided I would become
part of this tale.
It began...
Well, it began as you might expect.
In a hole in the ground...
...there lived a Hobbit.
Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole
full of worms and oozy smells.
This was a Hobbit hole.
And that means good food, a warm hearth...
...and all the comforts of home.
Thank you.
What's this?
That is private. Keep your sticky paws off.
It's not ready yet.
Not ready for what?
Reading.
What on earth are these?
Replies to the party invitations.
Ah. Good gracious. Is it today?
They all say they're coming.
Except for the Sackville-Bagginses,
who are demanding you ask them in person.
Are they, indeed? Over my dead body.
They'd probably find that quite agreeable.
They seem to think you have tunnels...
- ...overflowing with gold.
- It was one small chest, hardly overflowing.
And it still smells of Troll.
What on earth are you doing?
Taking precautions.
You know, I caught her making off
with the silverware once.
- Who?
- Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.
She had all my spoons
stuffed in her pocket. Ha!
Dreadful woman.
Make sure you keep an eye on her
after I'm...
When I'm... When I'm...
When you're what?
It's nothing. Nothing.
You know, some people are beginning
to wonder about you, Uncle.
- Huh?
- They think you're becoming odd.
Odd? Oh. Hm.
Unsociable.
Unsociable, me? Nonsense.
Be a good lad and put that on the gate.
- Do you think he'll come?
- Who?
Gandalf.
Oh-ho. He wouldn't miss a chance
to let off his Whizpoppers.
He'll give us quite a show, you'll see.
- Right, then. I'm off.
- Off to where?
East-farthing Woods.
I'm going to surprise him.
Well, go on, then.
You don't want to be late.
He doesn't approve of being late. Oh, no.
Not that I ever was.
In those days, I was always on time.
I was entirely respectable.
And nothing unexpected...
...ever happened.
- Good morning.
- What do you mean?
Do you wish me a good morning...
...or do you mean that it is a good morning
whether I want it or not?
Or perhaps you mean to say that you
feel good on this particular morning?
Or are you simply stating
that this is a morning to be good on? Hm?
All of them at once, I suppose.
Hmm.
Can I help you?
That remains to be seen.
I'm looking for someone
to share in an adventure.
An adventure?
No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree
would have much interest in adventures.
Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things.
Make you late for dinner. Heh, heh.
Mm. Huh.
Hmm.
Oh. Ah.
Good morning.
To think that I should have lived
to be "good morninged"...
...by Belladonna Took's son
as if I were selling buttons at the door.
Beg Your pardon?
You've changed, and not entirely
for the better, Bilbo Baggins.
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Well, you know my name,
although you don't remember I belong to it.
I'm Gandalf.
And Gandalf means...
...me.
Gandalf?
Not Gandalf the wandering Wizard...
...who made such excellent fireworks?
Old Took used to have them on
Midsummer's Eve. Heh, heh. Ahem.
No idea you were still in business.
And where else should I be?
Where else...? Ahem.
Well, I'm pleased to find you remember
something about me...
...even if it's only my fireworks.
Yes. Well, that's decided.
It'll be very good for you...
...and most amusing for me.
I shall inform the others.
Inform the who? What?
No. No. No... Wait.
We do not want any adventures here,
thank you. Not today. Not...
I suggest you try Over the Hill
or Across the Water.
Good morning.
Dwalin, at your service.
Hm. Uh...
Bilbo Baggins, at yours.
Do we know each other?
No.
Which way, laddie?
Is it down here?
Is what down where?
Supper.
He said there'd be food and lots of it.
He... He said? Who said?
Mmm.
Mmm.
Very good, this. Any more?
What? Oh, yes, yes. Ah.
Help yourself.
Hmm. It's just that, um,
I wasn't expecting company.
That'll be the door.
Balin, at your service.
- Good evening.
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- Though I think it might rain later.
- Hm?
Am I late?
Late for what?
Oh! Ha, ha!
Evening, brother.
By my beard...
...you're shorter and
wider than last we met.
Wider, not shorter.
Sharp enough for both of us.
Uh, excuse me? Sorry, I hate to interrupt.
But the thing is, I'm not entirely sure
you're in the right house.
Have you eaten?
It's not that I don't like visitors.
I like visitors as much as the next Hobbit.
But I do like to know them
before they come visiting.
- What is this?
- I don't know.
- I think it's cheese. Gone blue.
- It's riddled with mold.
The thing is, I don't know either of you.
Not in the slightest.
I don't mean to be blunt,
but I had to speak my mind.
- I'm sorry.
- You think...?
Apology accepted.
- Ah.
- Now, fill it up, brother, don't stint.
- You wanna get stuck in?
- I could eat again if you insist, brother.
- Fili.
- And Kili.
At your service.
- You must be Mr. Boggins.
- Nope! You can't come in.
- You've come to the wrong house.
- What?
- Has it been canceled?
- No one told us.
- No, nothing's been canceled.
- That's a relief.
Careful with these.
I just had them sharpened.
- It's nice, this place.
- Yeah.
- Did you do it yourself?
- What? No, it's been in the family for years.
That's my mother's glory box.
Can you please not do that?
Fili, Kili. Come on, give us a hand.
Mr. Dwalin. Ha, ha.
Shove this in the hallway.
Otherwise we'll never get everyone in.
"Everyone"? How many more are there?
- Where do you want this?
- Oh, no.
- It's really heavy.
- No. No. There's nobody home!
Go away and bother somebody else.
There's far too many Dwarves
in my dining room as it is.
If this is some clot-head's
idea of a joke...
...I can only say it is in very poor taste.
Get off, you big lump!
Gandalf.
Those are my pri...! Excuse me, not my wine.
Put that back. Put that back.
Not the jam, please.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
It's a tad excessive, isn't it?
Have you got a cheese knife?
- "Cheese knife"? He eats it by the block.
- Ugh.
No, that's Grandpa Mungo's chair...
No, so is that. Take it back, please.
- I cannot hear what you're saying. BILBO:
- It's an antique. Not for sitting on.
That is a book, not a coaster.
And put that map down.
- Excuse me, Mr. Gandalf?
- Yes?
May I tempt you with a cup of chamomile?
Oh, no, thank you, Dori.
A little red wine for me, I think.
- Whoop! Mind out.
- Yes. Ah.
Uh, Fili, Kili. Uh...
Oin, Gloin.
Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur...
- ...Dori, Nori. Ori!
- No. Not my prizewinners, thank you.
No, thank you.
Yes, you're quite right, Bifur.
We appear to be one Dwarf short.
He is late, is all. He traveled north
to a meeting of our kin. He will come.
Mr. Gandalf? A little glass of red wine,
as requested.
It's got a fruity bouquet.
Oh. Cheers.
Bombur's on his second leg of lamb already.
Hmm.
No chance. Not from that distance.
Wanna bet?
Bombur, catch!
I'll help you with that.
Oh, you great galumphing git!
- Who wants an ale? There you go.
- Over here, brother.
I said have another drink. Here you go.
Ale on the count of three!
One, two...
Up!
I knew you had it in you!
Excuse me, that is a
doily, not a dishcloth.
But it's full of holes.
It's supposed to look like that.
It's crochet.
And a wonderful game it is too,
if you've got the balls for it.
Be bother and confusticate these Dwarves!
My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the matter?
What's the matter?
I'm surrounded by Dwarves.
What are they doing here?
Oh, they're quite a merry gathering
once you get used to them.
I don't want to get used to them.
Look at the state of my kitchen.
There's mud trod into the carpet.
They've pillaged the pantry.
I won't tell you what they've done
in the bathroom.
They've destroyed the plumbing. I don't
understand what they're doing in my house!
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt,
but what should I do with my plate?
Here you go, Ori. Give it to me.
Take that back. Excuse me.
That's my mother's West Farthing pottery.
It's over 100 years old!
And can you not do that? You'll blunt them.
Ooh. Do you hear that, lads?
He says we'll blunt the knives.
Blunt the knives, bend the forks
Smash the bottles and bum the corks
Chip the glasses and crack the plates
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates
Cut the cloth, tread on the fat
Leave the bones on the bedroom mat
Pour the milk on the pantry floor
Splash the wine on every door
Dump the crooks in a boiling bowl
Pound them up with a thumping pole
When you're finished, if they are whole
Send them down the hall to roll
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates
Bilbo.
He is here.
Gandalf.
I thought you said this place
would be easy to find.
I lost my way, twice.
I wouldn't have found it at all
had it not been for that mark on the door.
Mark? There's no mark on that door.
It was painted a week ago.
There is a mark. I put it there myself.
Bilbo Baggins, allow me to introduce
the leader of our company:
Thorin Oakenshield.
So...
...this is the Hobbit.
Tell me, Mr. Baggins,
have you done much fighting?
- Pardon me?
- Ax or sword?
What's your weapon of choice?
Well, I do have some skill at conkers,
if you must know...
...but I fail to see why that's relevant.
Thought as much.
He looks more like a grocer than a burglar.
What news from the meeting in Ered Luin?
Did they all come?
- Aye. Envoys from all seven kingdoms.
- All of them!
And what did the Dwarves
of the Iron Hills say?
Is Dain with us?
They will not come.
They say this quest is ours and ours alone.
You're going on a quest?
Bilbo, my dear fellow,
let us have a little more light.
Far to the east...
...over ranges and rivers...
...beyond woodlands and wastelands...
...lies a single, solitary peak.
"The Lonely Mountain."
Aye, Oin has read the portents...
...and the portents say it is time.
Ravens have been seen flying back
to the mountain, as it was foretold.
"When the birds of yore return to Erebor...
...the reign of the beast will end."
Uh, what beast?
That would be a reference
to Smaug the Terrible...
...chiefest and greatest
calamity of our age.
Airborne fire-breather.
Teeth like razors, claws like meat hooks.
- Extremely fond of precious metals.
- Yes, I know what a dragon is.
I'm not afraid. I'm up for it.
I'll give him a taste of Dwarfish iron
right up his jacksie!
- Good lad, Ori!
- Sit down.
The task would be difficult enough
with an army behind us...
...but we number just 13.
And not 13 of the best...
...nor brightest.
Here, who are you calling dim?
Sorry, what did he say?
We may be few in number...
...but we're fighters, all of us,
to the last Dwarf.
And you forget,
we have a Wizard in our company.
Gandalf will have killed
hundreds of dragons in his time.
Oh, well, no. I wouldn't say...
- How many, then?
- What?
Well, how many dragons have you killed?
Go on. Give us a number.
Excuse me. Please.
If we have read these signs...
...do you not think others
will have read them too?
Rumors have begun to spread.
The dragon, Smaug,
has not been seen for 60 years.
Eyes look east to the
mountain, assessing...
...wondering, weighing the risk.
Perhaps the vast wealth of our people
now lies unprotected.
Do we sit back while others claim
what is rightfully ours?
Or do we seize this chance
to take back Erebor?
You forget, the Front Gate is sealed.
There is no way into the mountain.
That, my dear Balin, is not entirely true.
How come you by this?
It was given to me by your father.
By Thrain. For safekeeping.
It is yours now.
If there is a key...
...there must be a door.
These runes speak of a hidden
passage to the Lower Halls.
There's another way in.
Well, if we can find it,
but Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.
The answer lies hidden somewhere
in this map...
...and I do not have the skill to find it.
But there are others in Middle-earth
who can.
The task I have in mind
will require a great deal of stealth...
...and no small amount of courage.
But if we are careful and clever,
I believe that it can be done.
That's why we need a burglar.
Hmm. And a good one too.
An expert, I'd imagine.
And are you?
Am I what?
He said he's an expert. Hey.
Me? No. No, no, no. I'm not a burglar.
I've never stolen a thing in my life.
Well, I'm afraid I have to agree
with Mr. Baggins.
He's hardly burglar material.
Nope.
Aye, the Wild is no place for gentle folk who
can neither fight nor fend for themselves.
He's just fine.
Enough!
If I say Bilbo Baggins is a burglar,
then a burglar he is.
Hobbits are remarkably light on their feet.
In fact, they can pass unseen by most,
if they choose.
And, while the dragon is accustomed
to the smell of Dwarf...
...the scent of a Hobbit
is all but unknown to him...
...which gives us a distinct advantage.
You asked me to find the 14th member of
this company and I have chosen Mr. Baggins.
There's a lot more to him
than appearances suggest.
And he's got a great deal more to offer
than any of you know.
Including himself.
You must trust me on this.
Very well.
- We will do it your way.
- No, no.
- Give him the contract.
- We're in. We're off.
It's just the usual.
Summary of out-of-pocket expenses...
...time required, remuneration...
...funeral arrangements, so forth.
Funeral arrangements?
I cannot guarantee his safety.
Understood.
Nor will I be responsible for his fate.
Agreed.
"Terms: Cash on delivery, up to but not exceeding
one-fourteenth of total profit, if any."
Hmm. Seems fair.
"Present company shall not be liable
for injuries inflicted by...
...or sustained as a consequence thereof,
including, but not limited to lacerations...
...evisceration..."
Incineration?
Aye. He'll melt the flesh off your bones
in the blink of an eye.
- You all right, laddie?
- Huh? Yeah.
Feel a bit faint.
- Think furnace with wings.
- Air.
I need air.
Flash of light, searing pain, then poof.
You're nothing more than a pile of ash.
Hmm.
Nope.
Oh, very helpful, Bofur.
I'll be all right.
Just let me sit quietly for a moment.
You've been sitting
quietly for far too long.
Tell me, when did doilies
and your mother's dishes...
...become so important to you?
I remember a young Hobbit who was always
running off in search of Elves in the woods.
Who would stay out late,
come home after dark...
...trailing mud and twigs and fireflies.
A young Hobbit who would have liked
nothing better...
...than to find out what was beyond
the borders of the Shire.
The world is not in your books and maps.
It's out there.
I can't just go running off into the blue.
I am a Baggins of Bag-end.
You are also a Took.
Did you know that your
great-great-great-great-uncle Bullroarer Took...
...was so large, he could
ride a real horse?
- Yes.
- Yes, well, he could.
In the Battle of Green Fields,
he charged the Goblin ranks.
He swung his club so hard, it knocked
the Goblin king's head clean off...
...and it sailed 100 yards through the air
and went down a rabbit hole.
And thus, the battle was won.
And the game of golf invented
at the same time.
I do believe you made that up.
Well, all good stories
deserve embellishment.
You'll have a tale or two to tell
of your own when you come back.
Can you promise that I will come back?
No.
And if you do...
...you will not be the same.
That's what I thought.
Sorry, Gandalf, I can't sign this.
You've got the wrong Hobbit.
It appears we have lost our burglar.
Probably for the best.
The odds were always against us.
After all, what are we?
Merchants, miners...
...tinkers, toy-makers.
Heh, heh. Hardly the stuff of legend.
There are a few warriors amongst us.
Old warriors.
I would take each and every one
of these Dwarves...
...over an army from the Iron Hills.
For when I called upon them,
they answered.
Loyalty, honor...
...a willing heart.
I can ask no more than that.
You don't have to do this.
You have a choice.
You've done honorably by our people.
You have built a new life for us
in the Blue Mountains.
A life of peace and plenty.
A life that is worth more than
all the gold in Erebor.
From my grandfather to my father,
this has come to me.
They dreamt of the day when the Dwarves
of Erebor would reclaim their homeland.
There is no choice, Balin.
Not for me.
Then we are with you, laddie.
We will see it done.
Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep
And caverns old
We must away
'Ere break of day
To find our long-forgotten gold
The pines were roaring on the height
The winds were moaning in the night
The fire was red, it flaming spread
The trees like torches
Blazed with light
Hello?
Yes.
Yes.
Here, Mr. Bilbo, where are you off to?
- Can't stop, I'm already late!
- Late for what?
I'm going on an adventure!
I said it. Didn't I say it?
Coming here was a waste of time.
That's true enough.
Ridiculous notion. Use a Hobbit?
A Halfling?
Whose idea was it anyway?
Wait!
Wait!
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.
I signed it.
Here.
Everything appears to be in order.
Welcome, Master Baggins...
...to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.
Give him a pony.
No, no, that won't be necessary.
Thank you. I'm sure I can keep up on foot.
I've done my fair share of
walking holidays, you know?
Even got as far as Frogmorton once. Aah!
Come on, Nori. Pay up.
- One more.
- Thanks, lad.
What's that about?
Oh, they took wagers
on whether or not you'd turn up.
Most of them bet that you wouldn't.
And what did you think?
Well...
My dear fellow,
I never doubted you for a second.
It's horse hair. Having a reaction.
No, wait, wait, stop.
Stop! We have to turn around.
What on earth is the matter?
- I forgot my handkerchief.
- Here.
Use this.
Move on.
You'll have to manage
without pocket handkerchiefs...
...and a good many other things,
Bilbo Baggins...
...before we reach our journey's end.
You were born to the rolling hills
and little rivers of the Shire.
But home is now behind you.
The world is ahead.
Hello, girl. Who's a good girl?
It's our little secret, Myrtle.
You must tell no one. Shh, shh.
What was that?
Orcs.
Orcs?
Throat-cutters.
There'll be dozens of them out there.
The lone-lands are crawling with them.
They strike in the wee small hours
when everyone's asleep.
Quick and quiet, no screams.
Just lots of blood.
You think that's funny?
You think a night raid by Orcs is a joke?
We didn't mean anything by it.
No, you didn't.
You know nothing of the world.
Don't mind him, laddie.
Thorin has more cause than most
to hate Orcs.
After the dragon took
the Lonely Mountain...
...King Thror tried to reclaim
the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Moria.
But our enemy had got there first.
Moria had been taken by legions of Orcs...
...led by the most vile of all their race:
Azog the Defiler.
The giant Gundabad Orc...
...had sworn to wipe out the line of Durin.
He began...
...by beheading the king.
No!
Thrain, Thorin's father,
was driven mad by grief.
He went missing. Taken
prisoner or killed...
...we did not know.
We were leaderless.
Defeat and death...
...were upon us.
That is when I saw him.
A young Dwarf prince...
...facing down the pale Orc.
He stood alone against this terrible foe.
His armor rent...
...wielding nothing but an oaken branch
as a shield.
Azog the Defiler learned that day...
...that the line of Durin
would not be so easily broken.
Our forces rallied...
wand drove the Orcs back.
And our enemy...
...had been defeated.
But there was no feast...
...nor song that night...
...for our dead
were beyond the count of grief.
We few had survived.
And I thought to myself then...
...there is one who I could follow.
There is one...
...I could call king.
And the pale Orc?
What happened to him?
He slunk back into the hole
whence he came.
That filth died of his wounds long ago.
Here, Mr. Gandalf, can't you do something
about this deluge?
It is raining, Master Dwarf...
...and it will continue to rain
until the rain is done.
If you wish to change the weather of the world,
you should find yourself another Wizard.
- Are there any?
- What?
- Other Wizards.
- There are five of us.
The greatest of our order
is Saruman the White.
Then there are the two Blue Wizards...
Do you know,
I've quite forgotten their names.
And who is the fifth?
Well, that would be Radagast the Brown.
Is he a great Wizard?
Or is he more like you?
I think he's a very great Wizard,
in his own way.
He's a gentle soul who prefers
the company of animals to others.
He keeps a watchful eye
over the vast forest lands...
...to the east. And a good thing too.
For always evil will look to find
a foothold in this world.
Not good. Not good at all.
Eww.
Oh, no. Sebastian.
Good gracious.
Come on.
Move back! Give him some air,
for goodness sake.
There. There.
I don't understand why it's not working.
It's not as if it's witchcraft.
Witchcraft.
Oh, but it is.
A dark and powerful magic.
Where on this good earth
did those foul creatures come from?
The old fortress?
Show me.
We'll camp here for the night.
Fili, Kili, look after the ponies.
Make sure you stay with them.
A farmer and his family used to live here.
- Oin, Gloin. Get a fire going.
- Aye.
Right you are.
I think it would be wiser to move on.
We could make for the Hidden Valley.
I have told you already...
...I will not go near that place.
Why not? The Elves could help us.
We could get food, rest, advice.
I do not need their advice.
We have a map that we cannot read.
Lord Elrond could help us.
Help?
A dragon attacks Erebor.
What help came from the Elves?
Orcs plunder Moria...
...desecrate our sacred halls.
The Elves looked on and did nothing.
And you ask me to seek out the very people
who betrayed my grandfather.
Who betrayed my father.
You are neither of them.
I did not give you that map and key
for you to hold onto the past.
I did not know that they
were yours to keep.
Everything all right?
Gandalf, where are you going?
To seek the company of the
only one around here who's got any sense.
- And who's that?
- Myself, Mr. Baggins.
I've had enough of Dwarves for one day.
Come on, Bombur, we're hungry.
Is he coming back?
He's been a long time.
- Who?
- Gandalf.
He's a Wizard. He does as he chooses.
Here, do us a favor. Take this to the lads.
Stop it. You've had plenty.
Aye, it's not a bad stew, Bombur.
I've had worse.
Dori could've cooked it. Ha-ha-ha.
Hilarious.
What's the matter?
- We're supposed to be looking after the ponies.
- Only we've encountered a slight problem.
We had 16.
Now there's 14.
Daisy and Bungo are missing.
Well, that's not good. Ha, ha.
And that is not good at all.
Shouldn't we tell Thorin?
Uh, no. Let's not worry him.
As our official burglar,
we thought you might like to look into it.
Well, uh...
- Look, something big uprooted these trees.
- That was our thinking.
It's something very big
and possibly quite dangerous.
Hey.
There's a light.
Over here.
Stay down.
What is it?
Trolls.
Oh.
He's got Myrtle and Minty.
I think they're gonna eat them.
We have to do something.
Yes, you should.
Mountain Trolls are slow and stupid,
and you're so small, they'll never see you.
It's perfectly safe. We'll be behind you.
If you run into trouble, hoot twice
like a barn owl and once like a brown owl.
Twice like a barn owl.
No, twice like a brown... Once like a...
Like a... Are you sure this is a good idea?
Mutton yesterday, mutton today...
...and, blimey, if it don't look like
mutton again tomorrow.
Quit your griping.
These ain't sheep. These is fresh nags.
Oh! I don't like horse. I never have.
Not enough fat on them.
Well, it's better than leathery old farmer.
All skin and bone, he was. I'm still
picking bits of him out of me teeth.
Well, that's lovely, that is. A floater.
Might improve the flavor.
Ah. There's more where that came from.
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Ow!
Sit down!
Well, I hope you're gonna gut these nags.
I don't like the stinky parts.
- Ow!
- I said sit down.
I'm starving!
Now, are we having horse tonight or what?
Shut your cakehole.
You'll eat what I give you.
How come he's the cook?
Everything tastes the same.
Everything tastes like chicken.
Except the chicken.
What tastes like fish!
I'm just saying,
a little appreciation would be nice.
Oh. "Thank you very much, Bert.
Lovely stew, Bert."
- How hard is that?
- Shh. Shh, shh. Shh.
Just needs a sprinkle of squirrel dung.
Here, that's my grog.
Sorry. Ow!
Ooh. That is beautifully balanced, that is.
Wrap your laughing gear around that, eh?
Good, isn't it?
That's why I'm the cook.
Oh, my guts are grumbling.
I got to snaffle something.
- Flesh, I need flesh.
- Ah! Ah!
Blimey!
Bert. Bert!
Look what's come out of me hooter.
It's got arms and legs and everything.
What is it?
I don't know. But I don't like
the way it wriggles around.
What are you, then? An oversized squirrel?
I'm a burglar... Uh, Hobbit.
A burglar Hobbit?
Can we cook him?
We can try.
He wouldn't make more than a mouthful.
Not when he's skinned and boned.
Perhaps there's more burglar Hobbits
around these parts.
Might be enough for a pie.
- Grab him!
- He's too quick.
Right. Come here, you little...
Gotcha.
Are there any more of you little fellas
hiding where you shouldn't?
No.
He's lying.
- No, I'm not!
- Hold his toes over the fire.
Make him squeal!
Drop him!
You what?
I said...
...drop him.
Get the sacks! Stick them in the sacks!
Ow!
Come on! Get up!
- Bilbo!
- Don't!
Lay down your arms...
...or we'll rip his off.
Oh! That's hot, that's hot, that's hot!
Don't bother cooking them.
Let's just sit on them
and squash them into jelly.
They should be sauted and grilled
with a sprinkle of sage.
Is this really necessary?
That does sound quite nice.
- Untie me, mister.
- Eat someone your own size.
Never mind the seasoning.
We ain't got all night.
Dawn ain't far away.
Let's get a move on.
I don't fancy being turned to stone.
Wait!
You are making a terrible mistake.
You can't reason with them.
They're half-wits!
Half-wits? What does that make us?
I meant with the seasoning.
What about the seasoning?
Well, have you smelt them?
You're gonna need something stronger
than sage before you plate this lot up.
- Traitor!
- What do you know about cooking Dwarf?
Shut up.
Let the flurgaburburhobbit talk.
The secret to cooking Dwarf is...
- Yes? Come on. Tell us the secret.
- It's, uh...
Yes, I'm telling you. The secret is...
...to skin them first.
What? Skin us?
Tom, get me filleting knife.
I'll skin you, you little...!
I won't forget that. I won't forget it.
What a load of rubbish.
I've eaten plenty with their skins on.
Scarf them, I say, boots and all.
He's right.
Nothing wrong with a bit of raw Dwarf.
Nice and crunchy.
Oh, not that one. He's infected.
- Huh?
- You what?
Yeah, he's got worms in his tubes.
- Eww!
- Aah!
In fact, they all have.
They're infested with parasites.
It's a terrible business.
I wouldn't risk it. I really wouldn't.
Parasites? Did he say "parasites"?
We don't have parasites.
You have parasites!
What are you talking about, laddie?
I've got parasites as big as my arm.
Mine are the biggest parasites.
I've got huge parasites.
- We're riddled.
- Yes, I'm riddled.
Yes, we are, badly.
What would you have us do, then?
Let them all go?
- Well...
- You think I don't know what you're up to?
This little ferret is taking us for fools.
- Ferret?
- Fools?
The dawn will take you all.
- Who's that?
- No idea.
Can we eat him too?
Get your foot out of my back.
Ah.
Where did you go to, if I may ask?
To look ahead.
- What brought you back?
- Looking behind.
Nasty business.
Still, they're all in one piece.
No thanks to your burglar.
He had the nous to play for time.
None of the rest of you thought of that.
They must have come down
from the Ettenmoors.
Since when do Mountain Trolls
venture this far south?
Ooh. Not for an age.
Not since a darker power ruled these lands.
They could not have moved in daylight.
There must be a cave nearby.
Oh, what's that stench?
It's a Troll-hoard.
Be careful what you touch.
Seems a shame
just to leave it lying around.
- Anyone could take it.
- Agreed.
- Nori.
- Yeah?
Get a shovel.
These swords were not made by any Troll.
Nor were they made
by any smith among Men.
These were forged in Gondolin...
...by the High Elves of the First Age.
You could not wish for a finer blade.
- Set it down.
- That's good.
All right, come on. Quick.
We're making a long-term deposit.
Let's get out of this foul place.
Come on, let's go.
Bofur, Gloin, Nori.
- Bilbo.
- Hmm?
Here.
This is about your size.
I can't take this.
The blade is of Elvish make...
...which means it will glow blue
when Orcs or Goblins are nearby.
I have never used a sword in my life.
And I hope you never have to.
But if you do, remember this:
True courage is about knowing
not when to take a life...
...but when to spare one.
Something's coming!
- Gandalf.
- Stay together!
Hurry now! Arm yourselves!
Thieves! Fire! Murder!
Radagast.
It's Radagast the Brown.
Well...
What on earth are you doing here?
I was looking for you, Gandalf.
Somethings wrong.
Somethings terribly wrong.
Yes?
Oh.
Just give me a minute.
Oh. I had a thought and now I've lost it.
It was right there on the tip of my tongue.
Oh. It's not a thought at all.
It's a silly old...
...stick insect.
The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf.
A darkness has fallen over it.
Nothing grows anymore.
At least, nothing good.
The air is foul with decay.
But worse are the webs.
Webs? What do you mean?
Spiders, Gandalf.
Giant ones.
Some kind of spawn of Ungoliant,
or I am not a Wizard.
I followed their trail.
They came from Dol Guldur.
Huh?
Dol Guldur?
But the old fortress is abandoned.
No, Gandalf.
'Tis not.
A dark power dwells in there...
...such as I have never felt before.
It is the shadow of an ancient horror.
One that can summon the spirits...
...of the dead.
I saw him, Gandalf.
From out of the darkness...
...a Necromancer has come.
Radagast.
Quick! Quick, quick! Quick, quick!
Wait for me!
Sorry.
Try a little Old Toby.
It'll help settle your nerves.
And out.
Now, a Necromancer. Are you sure?
That is not...
...from the world of the living.
Was that a wolf?
Are there wolves out there?
Wolves? No, that is not a wolf.
Kili! Get your bow!
Warg scouts.
- Which means an Orc pack is not far behind.
- Orc pack?
Who did you tell about your quest
beyond your kin?
- No one.
- Who did you tell?
No one, I swear.
What in Durin's name is going on?
You are being hunted.
- We have to get out of here.
- We can't. We have no ponies.
They bolted.
I'll draw them off.
These are Gundabad Wargs.
They will outrun you.
These are Rhosgobel rabbits.
I'd like to see them try.
Come on! Come on!
Come and get me! Ha, ha!
Come on.
Stay together.
Move!
Ori, no! Get back.
All of you, come on. Quick!
Where are you leading us?
Move!
Run!
There they are!
This way! Quickly!
There's more coming!
Kili! Shoot them!
We're surrounded!
Where's Gandalf?
He's abandoned us.
Hold your ground!
This way, you fools!
Come on, move!
Quickly! All of you!
Come on!
Go, go, go!
Eight, nine, 10.
Kili! Run!
Elves.
I cannot see where the pathway leads.
Do we follow it or not?
Follow it, of course.
I think that would be wise.
Come on now, brother.
The Valley of Imladris.
In the common tongue,
it's known by another name.
Rivendell.
Here lies the Last Homely House
East of the Sea.
This was your plan all along.
To seek refuge with our enemy.
You have no enemies here,
Thorin Oakenshield.
The only ill will to be found in this
valley is that which you bring yourself.
You think the Elves will give our quest
their blessing?
They will try to stop us.
Of course they will. But we have questions
that need to be answered.
If we are to be successful,
this will need to be handled with tact.
And respect.
And no small degree of charm.
Which is why you will leave the talking
to me.
Mithrandir.
Ah. Lindir.
Stay sharp.
I must speak with Lord Elrond.
My Lord Elrond is not here.
Not here?
Where is he?
Close ranks!
- Gandalf.
- Lord Elrond.
Strange for Orcs to come
so close to our borders.
Something or someone
has drawn them near.
That may have been us.
Welcome, Thorin, son of Thrain.
I do not believe we have met.
You have your grandfather's bearing.
I knew Thror
when he ruled Under the Mountain.
Indeed? He made no mention of you.
What is he saying?
Does he offer us insult?
No, Master Gloin, he's offering you food.
Well, in that case, lead on.
Hey. Come on.
Try it. Just a mouthful.
I don't like green food.
Where's the meat?
Have they got any chips?
Kind of you to invite us.
Not really dressed for dinner.
Well, you never are.
This is Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver.
A famous blade...
...forged by the High Elves of the West,
my kin.
May it serve you well.
And this is Glamdring...
...the Foehammer.
Sword of the King of Gondolin.
These were made for the Goblin Wars
of the First Age.
I wouldn't bother, laddie. Swords are
named for the great deeds they do in war.
What are you saying,
my sword hasn't seen battle?
I'm not actually sure it is a sword.
More of a letter opener, really.
How did you come by these?
We found them in a Troll-hoard
on the Great East Road...
...shortly before we were
ambushed by Orcs.
And what were you doing
on the Great East Road?
Our business is no concern of Elves.
For goodness sake, Thorin,
show him the map.
It is the legacy of my people.
It is mine to protect, as are its secrets.
Save me from the stubbornness
of Dwarves.
Your pride will be your downfall.
You stand in the presence
of one of the few in Middle-earth...
...who can read that map.
Show it to Lord Elrond.
Thorin, no.
Erebor.
What is your interest in this map?
It's mainly academic.
As you know, this sort of artifact
sometimes contains hidden text.
You still read ancient Dwarvish,
do you not?
Moon runes?
Of course.
An easy thing to miss.
Well, in this case, that is true.
Moon runes can only be read
by the light of a moon...
...of the same shape and season
as the day on which they were written.
Can you read them?
These runes were written
on a Midsummer's Eve...
...by the light of a crescent moon
nearly 200 years ago.
It would seem you were meant
to come to Rivendell.
Fate is with you, Thorin Oakenshield.
The same moon shines upon us tonight.
"Stand by the gray stone
when the thrush knocks...
...and the setting sun with the last light
of Durin's Day...
...will shine upon the keyhole."
- Durin's Day?
It is the start of the Dwarves' new year,
when the last moon of autumn...
...and the first sun of winter
appear in the sky together.
This is ill news.
Summer is passing.
Durin's Day will soon be upon us.
We still have time.
- Time? For what?
- To find the entrance.
We have to be standing in exactly
the right spot at exactly the right time.
Then, and only then,
can the door be opened.
So this is your purpose,
to enter the mountain?
What of it?
There are some
who would not deem it wise.
What do you mean?
You are not the only guardian
to stand watch over Middle-earth.
No, you did the same thing.
- It's not like you didn't do it.
- Dori! Here, take that.
Bombur!
With or without our help, these Dwarves
will march on the mountain.
They're determined to reclaim
their homeland.
I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield
feels that he is answerable to anyone.
Nor, for that matter, am I.
It is not me you must answer to.
Lady Galadriel.
Mithrandir.
I had no idea Lord Elrond had sent for you.
He didn't.
I did.
Ah.
Saruman.
You've been busy of late, my friend.
Tell me, Gandalf...
...did you think these plans and schemes
of yours would go unnoticed?
Unnoticed?
No.
I'm simply doing what I feel to be right.
The dragon has long been on your mind.
That is true, my lady.
Smaug owes allegiance to no one.
But if he should side with the enemy...
...a dragon could be used
to terrible effect.
What enemy?
Gandalf, the enemy is defeated.
Sauron is vanquished.
He can never regain his full strength.
Gandalf, for 400 years
we have lived in peace...
...a hard-won, watchful peace.
Are we? Are we at peace?
Trolls have come down
from the mountains.
They are raiding villages,
destroying farms.
Orcs have attacked us on the road.
Hardly a prelude to war.
Always you must meddle...
...looking for trouble where none exists.
Let him speak.
There is something at work
beyond the evil of Smaug.
Something far more powerful.
We can remain blind to it, but it will not
be ignoring us, that I can promise you.
A sickness lies over the Greenwood.
The woodsmen who live there now
call it Mirkwood.
And they say...
Well? Don't stop now.
Tell us what the woodsmen say.
They speak of a Necromancer
living in Dol Guldur.
A sorcerer who can summon the dead.
That's absurd.
No such power exists in this world.
This Necromancer is nothing more
than a mortal man.
A conjurer dabbling in black magic.
And so I thought too.
- But Radagast has seen...
- Radagast?
Do not speak to me
of Radagast the Brown.
He's a foolish fellow.
Well, he's odd, I grant you.
He lives a solitary life.
It's not that. It's his excessive
consumption of mushrooms.
They've addled his brain
and yellowed his teeth.
I've warned him.
It is unbefitting one of the Istari
to be wandering the woods...
You carry something.
It came to you from Radagast.
He found it in Dol Guldur.
Yes.
Show me.
...Listen to me.
I would think I was talking to myself
for all the attention that he paid.
By all means...
What is that?
A relic of Mordor.
A Morgul Blade.
Made for the Witchking of Angmar.
And buried with him.
When Angmar fell...
...the Men of the North took his body
and all that he possessed...
...and sealed it within
the High Fells of Rhudaur.
Deep within the rock they buried him...
...in a tomb so dark...
...it would never come to light.
This is not possible.
A powerful spell lies upon those tombs.
They cannot be opened.
What proof do we have this weapon
came from Angmar's grave?
- I have none.
- Because there is none.
Let us examine what we know.
A single Orc pack...
...has dared to cross the Bruinen.
A dagger from a bygone age
has been found.
And a human sorcerer who calls himself
"The Necromancer"...
...has taken up residence
in a ruined fortress.
It's not so very much after all.
The question of this Dwarvish company,
however, troubles me deeply.
I'm not convinced, Gandalf.
I do not feel I can condone such a quest.
If they'd come to me, I might have
spared them this disappointment.
I do not pretend to understand your reason
for raising their hopes.
They are leaving.
Yes.
You knew.
No, I'm afraid there is
nothing else for it.
My Lord Elrond.
The Dwarves, they're gone.
Be on your guard.
We're about to step over
the Edge of the Wild.
Balin, you know these paths. Lead on.
Aye.
Master Baggins...
...I suggest you keep up.
- You will follow them.
- Yes.
You are right to help
Thorin Oakenshield.
But I fear this quest has set in motion...
...forces we do not yet understand.
The riddle of the Morgul Blade
must be answered.
Something moves in the shadows unseen,
hidden from our sight.
It will not show itself.
Not yet.
But every day it grows in strength.
You must be careful.
Mithrandir?
Why the Halfling?
I do not know.
Saruman believes
that it is only great power...
...that can hold evil in check.
But that is not what I have found.
I have found it is the small things...
...everyday deeds of ordinary folk...
...that keeps the darkness at bay.
Simple acts of kindness and love.
Why Bilbo Baggins?
Perhaps it is because I'm afraid...
...and he gives me courage.
Do not be afraid, Mithrandir.
You are not alone.
Hey! Hold on!
- Aah!
- Bilbo!
We must find shelter!
Look out!
Look out, brother!
Hold on!
This is no thunderstorm.
It's a thunder-battle!
Look!
Well, bless me.
The legends are true.
Giants! Stone-Giants!
Take cover, you fool!
Hold on!
- What's happening?
- Grab my hand!
- Go, go, go!
- Run! Get off! Get off!
- Run!
- Look out!
Look out!
Jump!
Come on!
Hold on!
No!
No!
No! Kili!
It's all right! They're alive!
Where's Bilbo? Where's the Hobbit?
There!
Get him!
Aah!
- Grab my hand!
- Bilbo!
- Ori, be careful!
- Take it!
- I've got you, lad.
- Grab on! Grab on!
Come on. Get him.
Come on, lad. Up you get.
I thought we'd lost our burglar.
He's been lost ever since he left home.
He should never have come.
He has no place amongst us.
Dwalin!
- It looks safe enough.
- Search to the back.
Caves in the mountain
are seldom unoccupied.
There's nothing here.
Right, then. Let's get a fire started.
No. No fires. Not in this place.
Get some sleep.
We start at first light.
We were to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joined us.
- That was the plan.
- Plans change.
Bofur, take the first watch.
Where do you think you're going?
Back to Rivendell.
No, no, you can't turn back now, eh?
You're part of the company.
You're one of us.
I'm not, though, am I?
Thorin said I should never have come
and he was right.
I'm not a Took, I'm a Baggins.
I don't know what I was thinking.
- I should never have run out my door.
- You're homesick. I understand.
No, you don't. You don't understand.
None of you do.
You're Dwarves.
You're used to this life.
To living on the road, never settling
in one place, not belonging anywhere!
Oh, I am sorry. I didn't...
No, you're right.
We don't belong anywhere.
I wish you all the luck in the world.
I really do.
What's that?
Hmm?
Wake up! Wake up!
Whoa!
Look out! Look out!
Get away!
Filthy scum!
Get back!
You'll pay for this!
Got you.
All right, all right. Don't push.
Get off! Get your hands off me!
Get off me!
Get off me!
Who would be so bold
as to come armed into my kingdom?
Spies? Thieves? Assassins?
Dwarves, You r Malevolence.
Dwarves?
We found them on the Front Porch.
Well, don't just stand there. Search them.
Every crack. Every crevice.
What are you doing in these parts?
Speak!
Very well. If they will not talk,
we'll make them squawk.
Bring up the mangler.
Bring up the bonebreaker.
- Start with the youngest.
- Wait!
Well, well, well.
Look who it is.
Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror...
...King Under the Mountain.
Oh, but I'm forgetting.
You don't have a mountain.
And you're not a king...
...which makes you nobody, really.
I know someone who would
pay a pretty price for your head.
Just a head.
Nothing attached.
Perhaps you Know of whom I speak.
An old enemy of yours.
A pale Orc, astride a white Warg.
Azog the Defiler was destroyed.
He was slain in battle long ago.
So you think his defiling days are done,
do you?
Send word to the pale Orc.
Tell him I have found his prize.
Yes!
Yes.
Yes.
Yes!
Gollum, gollum!
Aah!
Nasty Goblinses!
Better than old bones, precious.
Better than nothing.
Too many boneses, precious.
Not enough flesh!
Shut up! Cut its skin off.
Start with its head.
The cold hard lands
They bites our hands
They gnaws our feet
The rocks and stones
They're like old bones
All bare of meat
Cold as death Without no breath
It's good to eat
Bless us and splash us, precious.
That's a meaty mouthful.
Gollum, gollum! Aah.
Back. Stay back.
I'm warning you, don't come any closer.
It's got an Elfish blade.
But it's not an Elfs.
Not an Elfs, no.
What is it, precious?
What is it?
My name is Bilbo Baggins.
Bagginses?
What is a Bagginses, precious?
- I'm a Hobbit from the Shire.
- Oh.
We like Goblinses, batses and fishes.
But we hasn't tried Hobbitses before.
Is it soft? Is it juicy?
Now, now, keep your distance!
I'll use this if I have to.
Aah!
I don't want any trouble,
do you understand?
Just show me the way to get out of here
and I'll be on my way.
Why? Is it lost?
Yes. Yes, and I want to get unlost
as soon as possible.
Ooh, we knows!
We knows safe paths for Hobbitses.
Safe paths in the dark.
Shut up!
- I didn't say anything.
- We wasn't talking to you.
Oh, yes, we was, precious. We was.
Look, I don't know what your game is,
but I...
Games?!
Oh, we love games,
doesn't we, precious?
Does it like games? Does it, does it?
Does it like to play?
Maybe.
What has roots as nobody sees?
Is taller than trees?
Up, up, up it goes
And yet, never grows
- The mountain.
- Yes, yes.
Oh, let's have another one, eh?
Yes! Do it again, do it again. Ask us.
No! No more riddles.
Finish him off. Finish him now!
Gollum, gollum!
No! No. No.
No. I want to play. I do.
I want to play. I can see...
...you are very good at this.
So why don't we...
...have a game of riddles? Yes?
Just you and me.
Yes. Yes, just us.
Yes. Yes.
And if I win...
...you show me the way out. Yes?
Yes. Yes.
And if it loses? What then?
Well, if it loses, precious,
then we eats it!
If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.
Fair enough.
Well, Baggins first.
Thirty white horses on a red hill
First they champ, then they stamp
Then they stand still
Teeth?
Teeth! Oh, yes, my precious!
But we... We only have nine.
Our turn.
Voiceless, it cries
Wingless flutters
Toothless bites
Mouthless mutters
Just a minute. Uh...
Oh. Oh!
We knows! We knows!
Shut up!
Wind.
It's wind. Of course it is.
Very clever, Hobbitses.
Very clever.
Ah-ah-ah.
A box without hinges, key or lid
Yet golden treasure inside is hid
Box.
Oh, um...
Box. The lid and a key.
- Well?
- It's nasty.
- Box. Key.
- Do you give up?
Give us a chance, precious!
Give us a chance!
Eggses!
Eggses!
Wet, crunchy little eggses. Yes.
Grandmother taught us
to suck them, yes!
We have one for you.
All things it devours
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers
Gnaws iron, bites steel
Grinds hard stones to meal
Answer us.
Give me a moment, please.
I gave you a good long while.
Birds, beasts... Beasts?
Trees, flowers.
I don't know this one.
Is it tasty?
Is it scrumptious?
Is it crunchable?
Let me think.
Let me think.
It's stuck.
Bagginses is stuck.
Time's up.
Time.
The answer is time.
Actually it wasn't that hard.
Last question.
Last chance.
Okay.
Ask us.
- Ask us!
- Yes, yes. All right.
What have I got in my pocket?
That's no fair.
It's not fair! It's against the rules!
Now ask us another one.
No. No, no, no.
You said ask me a question.
Well, that is my question.
What have I got in my pocket?
Three guesses, precious.
It must give us three!
Three guesses. Very well, guess away.
Handses!
Wrong. Guess again.
Fishbones, Goblins' teeth,
wet shells, bats' wings...
Knife! Oh, shut up!
Wrong again. Last guess.
String. Or nothing.
Two guesses at once.
Wrong both times.
So...
Come, then. I won the game.
You promised to show me the way out.
Did we say so, precious?
Did we say so?
What has it got in its pocketses?
That's no concern of yours.
You lost.
Lost?
Lost?
Lost?
Where is it?
Where is it?!
No!
Where is it?!
No! No!
Lost!
Curse us and splash us!
My precious is lost!
- What have you lost?
- Mustn't ask us! Not its business!
No!
Gollum, gollum!
What has it got...
...in its nasty...
little pocketses?
He stole it.
He stole it!
He stole it!
Bones will be shattered
Necks will be wrung
You'll be beaten and battered
From racks you'll be hung
You will die down here
And never he found
Down in the deep of Goblin-town
I know that sword!
It is the Goblin-cleaver!
The Biter!
The blade that sliced 1000 necks!
Slash them! Beat them! Kill them!
Kill them all!
Cut off his head!
Take up arms.
Fight.
Fight!
He wields the Foehammer! The Beater!
Bright as daylight!
Thorin!
Follow me. Quick!
Run!
Give it to us!
It's ours.
It's ours!
Thief!
Baggins!
Quickly!
Faster!
Post!
Charge!
Cut the ropes!
Come on, quickly!
- Come on, move!
- Bombur!
Go, go, go!
Jump!
Jump, lad!
Come on!
Push!
Come on!
Come on!
- Watch your backs!
- You thought you could escape me.
What are you going to do now, Wizard?
That'll do it.
Well, that could have been worse.
Haver!
You've got to be joking!
Gandalf!
There's too many. We can't fight them.
Only one thing will save us, daylight!
Come on! Here! On your feet.
- Balin.
- Come on!
Wait!
My precious. Wait!
Gollum, gollum!
Quick, quick!
This way.
- Come on.
- Come on, come on. Quickly.
Right, good!
Baggins!
Thief!
Curse it and crush it!
We hates it forever!
Five, six, seven, eight.
Bifur. Bofur. That's 10.
Fili, Kili! That's 12.
And Bombur. That makes 13.
Where's Bilbo?
Where is our Hobbit?
Where is our Hobbit?
Curse that Halfling! Now he's lost?
I thought he was with Dori!
- Don't blame me!
- Well, where did you last see him?
I think I saw him slip away
when they first collared us.
And what happened, exactly?
- Tell me!
- I'll tell you what happened.
Master Baggins saw his chance
and he took it.
He has thought of nothing
but his soft bed and his warm hearth...
...since first he stepped out of his door.
We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.
He is long gone.
No. He isn't.
Bilbo Baggins.
I have never been so glad
to see anyone in my life.
Bilbo. We'd given you up.
How on earth
did you get past the Goblins?
How, indeed.
Well, what does it matter? He's back.
It matters. I want to know.
Why did you come back?
Look, I know you doubt me.
I know you always have.
And you're right, I often think of Bag-end.
I miss my books.
And my armchair and my garden.
See, that's where I belong.
That's home.
And that's why I came back. Because...
...you don't have one. A home.
It was taken from you.
But I will help you take it back if I can.
Out of the frying pan.
And into the fire. Run.
Run!
Go!
Up into the trees!
All of you! Come on, climb! Bilbo, climb!
Quickly!
They're coming!
- Hang on!
- Hold on, brothers!
Azog.
It cannot be.
It's going!
Fili!
Yeah!
No!
Oh, no.
Mr. Gandalf!
Oh, no, Dori!
Help!
No!
Thorin! No!
Look.
Thorin!
Thorin!
Thorin.
The Halfling?
It's all right.
Bilbo is here. He's quite safe.
You!
What were you doing?
You nearly got yourself killed!
Did I not say that
you would be a burden?
That you would not survive in the Wild?
That you had no place amongst us?
I have never been so wrong in all my life.
But I'm sorry I doubted you.
No, I would have doubted me too.
I'm not a hero or a warrior.
Not even a burglar.
Is that what I think it is?
Erebor...
...the Lonely Mountain...
...the last of the great Dwarf kingdoms
of Middle-earth.
Our home.
A raven!
The birds are returning to the mountain.
That, my dear Oin, is a thrush.
But we'll take it as a sign.
- A good omen.
- You're right.
I do believe the worst is behind us.
Far over the misty mountains rise
Leave us standing upon the height
What was before
We see once more
Is our kingdom a distant light
Fiery mountain beneath the moon
The words unspoken, we'll be there soon
For home a song
That echoes on
And all who find us will know the tune
Some folk we never forget
Some kind we never forgive
Haven't seen the back of us yet
We'll fight as long as we live
All eyes on the hidden door
To the Lonely Mountain borne
We'll ride in the gathering storm
Until we get our long-forgotten gold
We lay under the misty mountains cold
In slumbers deep
And dreams of gold
We must awake
Our lives to make
And in the darkness a torch we hold
From long ago when lanterns burned
Until this day
Our hearts have yearned
Her fate unknown
The Arkenstone
What was stolen
Must be returned
We must awake
And make the day
To find a song for heart and soul
Some folk we never forget
Some kind we never forgive
Haven't seen the end of it yet
We'll fight as long as we live
All eyes on the hidden door
To the Lonely Mountain borne
We'll ride in the gathering storm
Till we get our long-forgotten gold
Far away from misty mountains cold
I'm dying of thirst over here.
Come on! Come on!
- Here you are.
- Thank you kindly.
- Oh, watch it!
- Sorry, darling.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Master Stadle.
Mind if I join you?
I'll have the same.
I should introduce myself.
My name is Gandalf.
Gandalf the Grey.
I know who you are.
Well, now. This is a fine chance.
What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?
I received word that my father...
...had been seen wandering...
...the Wilds near Dunland.
I went looking.
I found no sign of him.
Thorin, it's been a long time...
...since anything but rumor was heard...
...of Thrain.
He still lives.
I am sure of it.
My father came to see you
before he went missing.
What did you say to him?
I urged him to march upon Erebor,
to rally...
...the seven armies of the Dwarves...
...to destroy the dragon and take back...
...the Lonely Mountain.
And I would say the same to you.
Take back your homeland.
This is no chance meeting,
is it, Gandalf?
No.
It is not.
The Lonely Mountain troubles me...
...Thorin. That dragon
has sat there long enough.
Sooner or later...
...darker minds will turn towards Erebor.
I ran into some unsavory characters...
...whilst traveling on the Greenway.
They mistook me for a vagabond.
I imagine they regretted that.
One of them was carrying a message.
It is Black Speech.
A promise of payment.
For what?
Your head.
Someone wants you dead.
Thorin, you can wait no longer.
You are...
...the heir to the Throne of Durin.
Unite the armies of the Dwarves.
Together, you have the might and power...
...to retake Erebor.
Summon a meeting
of the seven Dwarf families.
Demand they stand by their oath.
The seven armies swore that oath
to the one who wields the King's Jewel.
The Arkenstone.
It is the only thing that will...
...unite them,
and in case you have forgotten...
...that jewel was stolen by Smaug.
What if I were to help you reclaim it?
How?
The Arkenstone lies half a world away...
...buried beneath the feet
of a fire-breathing dragon.
Yes, it does.
Which is why we're going to need a burglar.
How close is the pack?
Too close. A couple of leagues, no more.
But that's not the worst of it.
- Have the Wargs picked up our scent?
- Not yet. But they will do.
- We have another problem.
- Did they see you?
They saw you.
No, that's not it.
What did I tell you?
Quiet as a mouse.
Excellent burglar material.
Will you listen? Will you just...
...listen?
I'm trying to tell you
there is something else out there.
What form did it take?
Like a bear?
Ye... Yes, but bigger.
Much bigger.
You knew about this beast?
I say we double back.
And be run down by a pack of Orcs?
There is a house...
...it's not far from here,
where we might take refuge.
Whose house?
Are they friend or foe?
Neither.
He will help us or...
...he will kill us.
What choice do we have?
None.
Come on!
This way! Quickly!
Run!
Bombur, come on!
To the house!
Run!
Come on, get inside.
Open the door!
Quickly!
- Push!
- Push!
Dwalin!
Come on, lads!
What is...
...that?
That is our host.
His name is Beorn.
And he's a skin-changer.
Sometimes he's a huge black bear.
Sometimes he's a great strong man.
The bear is unpredictable...
...but the man can be reasoned with.
However...
...he is not overfond of Dwarves.
He's leaving.
Come away from there.
It's not natural. None of it.
It's obvious. He's under some...
...dark spell.
Don't be a fool.
He's under no enchantment but his own.
All right, now get some sleep. All of you.
You'll be safe here tonight.
I hope.
So you are the one they call Oakenshield.
Tell me...
...why is Azog...
...the Defiler hunting you?
You know of Azog?
How?
My people were the first to live
in the mountains...
...before the Orcs came down
from the North.
The Defiler killed most of my family.
But some he...
...enslaved.
Not for work, you understand...
...but for sport.
Caging skin-changers...
...and torturing them
seemed to amuse him.
There are others like you?
Once there were many.
And now?
Now there is only one.
You need to reach...
...the mountain before
the last days of autumn.
Before Durin's Day falls.
Yes.
You are running out of time.
Which is why we must
go through Mirkwood.
A darkness lies upon that forest.
Fell things creep beneath those trees.
There is an alliance
between the Orcs of Moria...
...and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.
I would not venture there...
...except in great need.
We will take the Elven Road.
That path is still safe.
"Safe"?
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood...
...are not like their kin.
They're less wise...
...and more dangerous.
But it matters not.
What do you mean?
These lands are crawling with Orcs.
Their numbers are growing.
And you are on foot.
You will never reach...
...the forest alive.
I don't like Dwarves.
They're greedy...
...and blind.
Blind to the lives of those they deem...
...lesser than their own.
But Orcs I hate more.
What do you need?
Go now. While you have the light.
Your hunters are not far behind.
The Elven Gate.
Here lies our path...
...through Mirkwood.
No sign of the Orcs.
We have luck on our side.
Set the ponies loose.
Let them return to their master.
This forest...
...feels...
...sick.
As if a disease lies upon it.
Is there no way around?
Not unless we go 200 miles north.
Or twice that distance...
...south.
Something moves in the shadows unseen...
...hidden from our sight.
Every day it grows in strength.
Beware the Necromancer.
He is not what he seems.
If our Enemy has returned,
we must know.
Go to the tombs in the mountains.
The High Fells.
So be it.
Not my horse!
I need it!
You're not leaving us?
I would not do this unless I had to.
You've changed...
...Bilbo Baggins.
You're not the same Hobbit
as the one who left the Shire.
I was going to tell you.
I...
...found something in the Goblin tunnels.
Found what?
What did you find?
My courage.
Good. Well, that's good.
You'll need it.
I'll be waiting for you
at the overlook, before...
...the slopes of Erebor.
Keep the map and key safe.
Do not enter that mountain without me.
This is not the Greenwood of old.
The very air of the forest
is heavy with illusion.
It'll seek to enter your mind
and lead you astray.
"Lead us astray"?
What does that mean?
You must stay on the path.
Do not leave it.
If you do, you'll never...
...find it again.
No matter what may come, stay on...
...the path!
Come on. We must reach the mountain
before the sun sets on Durin's Day.
- Durin's Day?
- Let's go.
It is our one chance
to find the hidden door.
The path turns this way.
This way.
Air. I need air.
My head, it's swimming!
What's happening?
Keep moving.
Nori...
...why have we stopped?
The path...
...it's disappeared.
What's going on?
We've lost the path!
Find it.
All of you, look. Look for the path!
I don't remember this bit.
None of it's familiar.
It's got to be here.
What hour is it?
I do not know. I do not even know
what day it is.
Is there no end to this accursed forest?!
Attercop.
Look.
A tobacco pouch.
There's Dwarves in these woods.
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains,
no less.
This is exactly the same as mine.
Because it is yours. Do you understand?
We're going around in circles.
We are lost.
We are not lost. We keep heading east.
But which way is east? We've lost the sun.
I thought you were the expert.
The sun.
We have to find...
...the sun.
Up there.
We need to...
...get above the canopy.
What was that?
Enough! Quiet! All of you!
We're being watched.
I can see a lake!
And a river.
And the Lonely Mountain.
We're almost there!
Can you hear me?
I know which way to go!
Hello?
Hello.
Oh, no.
Oh, come on.
Kill them! Kill them.
Eat them now,
while their blood is running.
Their hide is tough,
but there's good juice inside.
Stick it again.
Stick it again. Finish it off.
The meat's alive and kicking!
Kill him.
Kill him now.
Let us feast.
Feast! Feast!
Feast! Feast!
Eat them alive!
Feast!
- What is it?
- What is it?
Eat them alive!
Fat and juicy.
Just a...
...little taste.
Curse it! Where is it?! Where is it?!
Here.
Ah! It stings!
It stings!
Sting.
That's a good name.
Sting.
You all right there, Bofur?
- I'm all right!
- Get it off me!
Where's Bilbo?
I'm up here!
Grab the legs!
Pull!
Pull!
Where is it? Where is it? Come on.
Where is it?
No!
No! No!
Thorin! Get them!
Come on!
Look out, brother!
Fili!
Mine.
Come on...
...keep up!
We're clear!
Do not think I won't kill you, Dwarf.
It would be my pleasure.
- Help!
- Kili!
Throw me a dagger!
Quick!
If you think I'm giving you...
...a weapon, Dwarf...
...you're mistaken!
Search them.
B'ey! Give it back! That's private!
Who is this?
- Your brother?
- That is...
...my wife!
And what is this horrid creature?
A Goblin-mutant?
That's my wee lad, Gimli.
Where did you get this?
It was given to me.
Not just a thief, but a liar as well.
Thorin, where's Bilbo?
Unh! This is not the end of it!
- Do you hear me?!
- Hey, let us out of here!
Get off me!
Aren't you going to search me?
I could have anything down my trousers.
Or nothing.
- Again!
- Leave it!
There's no way out!
This is no Orc dungeon.
These are the Halls
of the Woodland Realm.
No one leaves here
but by the king's consent.
Some may imagine
that a noble quest is at hand.
A quest to reclaim a homeland...
...and slay a dragon.
I myself suspect a more prosaic motive.
Attempted burglary.
Or something of that ilk.
You have found...
...a way in.
You seek that which would...
...bestow upon you the right to rule.
The King's Jewel.
The Arkenstone.
It is precious to you beyond measure.
I understand that.
There are gems in the mountain
that I too desire.
White gems...
...of pure starlight.
I offer you my help.
I am listening.
I will let you go...
...if you but return what is mine.
A favor for a favor.
You have my word.
One king to another.
I would not trust Thranduil...
...the great king...
...to honor his word...
...should the end of all days
be upon us!
You...
...who lack all...
...honor!
I have seen how you treat your friends.
We came to you once,
starving, homeless...
...seeking your help.
But you turned your back!
You turned away from
the suffering of my people...
...and the inferno that destroyed us.
Do not talk to me of dragon fire.
I know...
...its wrath and ruin.
I have faced...
...the great serpents of the North.
I warned your...
...grandfather of what his greed
would summon.
But he would not listen.
You are just like him.
Stay here if you will...
...and rot.
A hundred years is a mere blink...
...in the life of an Elf.
I'm patient.
I can wait.
Did he offer you a deal?
He did.
I told him he could go
sh kakhf ai-'d dr-rugnu!
Him and all his kin!
Well, that's that, then.
A deal was our only hope.
Not our only hope.
I know you're there.
Why do you linger in the shadows?
I was coming to report to you.
I thought I ordered that nest
to be destroyed not two moons past.
We cleared...
...the forest as ordered, my lord.
But more spiders keep...
...coming up from the South.
They are spawning in...
...the ruins of Dol Guldur.
If we could kill them at their source...
That fortress lies beyond our borders.
Keep our lands clear of those
foul creatures. That is your task.
And when we drive them off, what then?
Will they not spread to other lands?
Other lands are not my concern.
The fortunes of the world...
...will rise and fall.
But here in this...
...kingdom, we will endure.
Legolas said you fought well today.
He has grown very fond of you.
I assure you, my lord...
...Legolas thinks of me as
no more than a captain of the guard.
Perhaps he did once.
Now I am not so sure.
I do not think you would allow your son...
...to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.
No, you are right. I would not.
Still, he cares about you.
Do not give him hope where there is none.
The stone in your hand, what is it?
It is a talisman.
A powerful spell lies upon it.
If any but a Dwarf
reads the runes on this stone...
...they will be forever cursed.
Or not.
Depending on whether you believe
in that kind of thing. It's just a token.
A rune stone.
My mother...
...gave it to me
so I'd remember my promise.
What promise?
That I would come back to her.
She worries.
She thinks I'm reckless.
Are you?
Nah.
Sounds like quite a party...
...you're having up there.
It is Mereth e-nGilith...
...the Feast of Starlight.
All light is sacred to the Eldar.
But Wood Elves love best
the light of the stars.
I always thought it is a cold light.
Remote and far away.
It is memory...
...precious and pure.
Like your promise.
I have walked there sometimes.
Beyond the forest...
...and up into the night.
I have seen the world fall away...
...and the white light
of forever fill the air.
I saw a fire moon once.
It rose over the pass near Dunland. Huge.
Red and gold, it was. It filled the sky.
We were an escort for some merchants
from Ered Luin. They were...
...trading in silverwork for furs.
We took the Greenway south...
...keeping the mountain to our left.
And then it appeared.
This huge fire moon...
...lighting our path.
I wish I could show you the caverns.
Galion, you old rogue,
we're running out of drink.
These empty barrels should have been
sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.
The bargeman will be waiting for them.
Say what you like about our...
...ill-tempered king.
He has excellent taste in wine.
Come, Elros, try it.
I have the Dwarves...
...in my charge.
They're locked up.
Where can they go? Ha, ha.
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.
Must be nearly dawn.
We're never gonna reach
the mountain, are we?
Not stuck in here, you're not.
Bilbo!
What?
Shh! There are guards nearby!
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Close the doors.
- It'll buy us more time.
- All right, Nori.
- Up the stairs.
- You first.
Ori.
Not that way. Down here. Follow me.
Go.
Easy, now.
This way.
Come on.
I don't believe it. We're in the cellars!
You were supposed to be leading us out,
not further in!
I know what I'm doing!
Shh!
This way! This way!
Everyone...
- ...climb into the barrels quickly.
- Are you mad?
- They'll find us.
- No, no.
They won't, I promise you.
Please, please. You must trust me.
Do as he says.
Move your big ginger head.
Bifur, get in...
...the barrel! Move!
Everyone's in.
What do we do now?
Hold your breath.
Hold my breath? What do you mean?
Where is the Keeper of the Keys?
Well done, Master Baggins.
Go! Come on, let's go!
Hold on!
Bilbo!
Hang on!
- Help!
- Ori!
No!
Watch out! There's Orcs!
Get under the bridge!
Kili!
Kili!
Kili.
Kili!
Nori!
Cut the log!
Bombur!
Tauriel.
Oh, it's you!
Why am I here, Gandalf?
Trust me, Radagast.
I would not have called you here
without good reason.
This is not a nice place to meet.
No.
It is not.
These are dark spells, Gandalf.
Old and full of hate.
Who's buried here?
If he had a name,
it's long since been lost.
He would have been known only...
...as a servant of evil.
One of a number.
One of nine.
Why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.
The Ringwraiths...
...have been summoned to Dol Guldur.
But it cannot be the Necromancer.
A human sorcerer
could not summon such evil.
Who said it was human?
The Nine only answer to one master.
We've been blind, Radagast.
And in our blindness...
...the Enemy has returned.
He is summoning his servants.
Azog the Defiler...
...is no ordinary hunter.
He is a commander.
A commander of legions.
The Enemy is preparing for war.
It will begin in the East.
His mind is set upon that mountain.
- Where are you going?
- To rejoin the others.
Gandalf.
I started this. I cannot forsake them.
They are in grave danger.
If what you say is true...
...the world is in grave danger.
The power in that fortress
will only grow stronger.
You want me to cast my friends aside?
- Anything behind us?
- Not that I can see.
- I think we've outrun the Orcs.
- Not for long. We've lost the current.
Bombur's half drowned.
- Make for the shore!
- Aye.
Come on, let's go!
Gloin, help me, my brother.
Come on, lift yourself.
Come on!
Come on, you big lump, you!
I'm fine. It's nothing.
On your feet.
Kili's wounded. His leg needs binding.
There's an Orc pack on our tail.
We keep moving.
To where?
To the mountain. We're so close.
A lake lies between us and that mountain.
- We have no way to cross it.
- So then we go around.
The Orcs will run us down,
as sure as daylight.
We've no weapons to defend ourselves.
Bind his leg, quickly.
You have two minutes.
Do it again...
...and you're dead.
Excuse me...
...but you're from Lake-town,
if I'm not mistaken.
That barge over there...
...it wouldn't be available for hire,
by any chance?
What makes you think I would help you?
Those boots have seen better days.
As has that coat.
No doubt you have
some hungry mouths to feed.
How many bairns?
A boy and two girls.
And your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.
Aye.
She was.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
Oh, come on, come on.
Enough of the niceties.
What's your hurry?
What's it to you?
I would like to know who you are...
...and what you are doing in these lands.
We are simple merchants
from the Blue Mountains...
...journeying to see our kin...
...in the Iron Hills.
Simple merchants, you say?
We need food...
...supplies, weapons.
Can you help us?
I know where these...
...barrels came from.
What of it?
I don't know what business you had
with the Elves...
...but I don't think it ended well.
No one enters Lake-town...
...but by leave of the Master.
All his wealth comes from trade
with the Woodland Realm.
He would see you in irons before
risking the wrath of King Thranduil.
Offer him more.
I'll wager there are...
...ways to enter that town unseen.
Aye.
But for that...
...you would need a smuggler.
For which we would pay double.
Such is the nature of evil.
Out there in...
...the vast ignorance of the world...
...it festers and spreads.
A shadow that grows in the dark.
A sleepless malice as black...
...as the oncoming wall of night.
So it ever was.
So will it always be.
In time, all foul things come forth.
You were tracking a company of 13 Dwarves.
Why?
Not 13.
Not anymore.
The young one...
...the black-haired archer...
...we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.
The poison's in his blood. He'll be...
...choking on it soon.
Answer the question, filth.
I would not antagonize her.
You like killing things, Orc?
You like death?
Then let me give it to you.
I do not care about one...
...dead Dwarf. Answer the question.
You have nothing to fear. Tell us...
...what you know
and I will set you free.
You had orders to kill them. Why?
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?
The Dwarf runt will never be king.
King?
There is no King Under the Mountain,
nor will there ever be.
None would dare enter Erebor...
...whilst the dragon lives.
You know nothing.
Your world will burn.
What are you talking about?
Speak!
Our time has come again.
My master serves the One.
Do you understand now, Elfling?
Death is upon you.
The flames of war...
...are upon you.
Why did you do that?
You promised to set him free.
And I did.
I freed his wretched head
from his miserable shoulders.
There was more...
...the Orc could tell us.
There was nothing more he could tell me.
What did he mean by "the flames of war"?
It means they intend to
unleash a weapon so great...
...it will destroy all before it.
I want the watch doubled at our borders.
All roads, all rivers.
Nothing moves, but I hear of it.
No one enters this kingdom.
And no one leaves it.
Watch out!
What are you trying...
...to do, drown us?
I was born and bred on these waters,
Master Dwarf.
If I wanted to drown you...
...I would not do it here.
Oh, I've had enough of this lippy Lakeman.
I say we throw him over the side
and be done with it.
- Bard, his name's Bard.
- How do you know?
Uh, I asked him.
I don't care what he calls himself.
I don't like him.
We do not have to like him.
We simply have to pay him.
Come on now, lads. Turn out...
...your pockets.
How do we know he won't betray us?
We don't.
There's...
...just a wee problem.
We're 10 coins short.
Gloin.
Come on.
- Give us what you have.
- Don't look to me.
I have been bled dry...
...by this venture.
What have I seen...
...for my investment?
Naught but misery and...
...grief and...
Bless my beard.
Take it.
- Take all of it.
- Ahem.
The money, quick. Give it to me.
We will pay you when we...
...get our provisions but not before.
If you value your freedom,
you'll do as I say.
There are guards ahead.
What's he doing?
He's talking to someone.
He's pointing right at us.
Now they're...
...shaking hands.
- What?
- The villain.
He's selling us out.
Quiet.
We're approaching the tollgate.
Halt!
Goods inspection!
Papers, please!
Oh, it's you, Bard.
Morning, Percy.
Anything to declare?
Nothing, but that I am cold and tired...
...and ready for home.
You and me both.
There we are.
All in order.
Not so fast.
"Consignment of empty barrels
from the Woodland Realm."
Only...
...they're not empty...
...are they, Bard?
If I recall correctly...
...you're licensed as a bargeman.
Not...
...a fisherman.
That's none of your business.
Wrong.
It's the Master's business,
which makes it my business.
Oh, come on, Alfrid, have a heart.
People need to eat.
These fish are illegal.
Empty the barrels...
- ...over the side.
- You heard him. In the canal.
Come on. Get a move on.
Folk in this town are struggling.
Times are hard.
Food is scarce.
That's not my problem.
And when the people hear
the Master is dumping fish...
...back in the lake...
...when the rioting starts...
...will it be your problem then?
Stop.
Ever the people's champion...
...eh, Bard? Protector of...
...the common folk.
You might have their favor now,
bargeman...
...but it won't last.
Raise the gate!
The Master has his eye on you.
You'd do well to remember:
We know where you live.
It's a small town, Alfrid.
Everyone knows where everyone lives.
All this talk of civil unrest.
Someone's been stirring the pot, sire.
Gout playing up, sire?
It's the damp.
It's the only possible explanation.
Get me a brandy.
The mood of the people, sire,
it's turning ugly.
They're commoners, Alfrid.
They've always been ugly.
It's not my fault they live in a place...
...that stinks of fish oil and tar.
Jobs, shelter, food.
It's all they ever bleat about.
It's my belief, sire, they are
being led on by troublemakers.
Then we must find these...
...troublemakers and arrest them.
My thoughts exactly, sire.
And all this talk of change
must be suppressed.
Can't afford to let the rabble
band together...
...and start making noises.
The next thing...
...you know, they'll start
asking questions...
...forming committees...
...launching inquiries.
Out with the old, in with the new?
What?
That's what they've been saying, sire.
There is even talk...
...of an election.
An election? Heh.
That's absurd.
I won't stand for it. Ha!
I don't think they'd ask
you to stand, sire.
Shirkers.
Ingrates.
Rabble-rousers.
Who would have the nerve
to question my authority?
Who would dare?
Who...?
Bard.
You mark my words:
That trouble-making bargeman...
...is behind all this.
Get your hands off me.
You didn't see them.
They were never here.
The fish you can have for nothing.
Follow me.
Da!
Our house, it's being watched.
You can tell the Master
I'm done...
...for the day.
Da! Where have you been?
Father! There you are! I was worried.
Here, Sigrid.
Bain, get them in.
If you speak of this to anyone...
...I'll rip your arms off.
Get off.
Up there.
Da...
...why are there Dwarves
climbing out of our toilet?
Will they bring us luck?
They may not be the best fit...
...but they'll keep you warm.
Thank you very much.
A Dwarvish windlance.
You look like...
...you've seen a ghost.
He has.
The last time we saw...
...such a weapon...
...a city was on fire.
It was the day the dragon came.
The day that Smaug...
...destroyed Dale.
Girion, the Lord of the City...
...rallied his bowmen...
...to fire upon the beast.
But a dragon's hide is tough.
Tougher than the strongest armor.
Only a Black Arrow fired
from a windlance...
...could have pierced the dragon's hide.
And few of those...
...arrows were ever made.
The store was running low...
...when Girion...
...made his last stand.
Had the aim of Men been true that day...
...much would have been different.
You speak as if you were there.
All Dwarves know the tale.
Then you would know
that Girion hit the dragon.
He loosened a scale under the left wing.
One more shot and
he would have killed the beast.
That's a fairy story, lad.
Nothing more.
You took our money.
Where are the weapons?
Wait here.
Tomorrow begins...
...the last days of autumn.
Durin's Day falls the morn after next.
We must reach the mountain before then.
And if we do not?
If we fail to find the hidden door
before that time?
Then this quest has been for nothing.
What is this?
Pike hook.
Made from an old harpoon.
- And this?
- A crowbill, we call it.
Fashioned from a smithy's hammer.
It's heavy in hand, I grant...
...but in defense of your life,
these will serve you better than none.
We paid...
...you for weapons.
Iron-forged swords...
...and axes!
It's a joke!
You won't find...
...better outside the city armory.
All iron-forged weapons are held there...
...under lock and key.
Thorin...
...why not take what's...
...on offer and go?
I've made do with less.
So have you.
- I say we leave now.
- You're not going anywhere.
What did you say?
There are spies watching this house...
...and probably every dock
and wharf in the town.
You must wait...
...till nightfall.
Thorin.
Da?
Don't let them leave.
Tauriel...
...you cannot hunt 30 Orcs...
...on your own.
But I'm not on my own.
You knew I would come.
The king is angry...
...Tauriel. For 600 years...
...my father has protected you,
favored you.
You defied his orders.
You betrayed his trust.
The king has never let Orc filth...
...roam our lands.
Yet he would let this Orc pack cross
our borders and kill our prisoners.
It is not our fight.
It is our fight.
It will not end here.
With every victory, this evil will grow.
If your father has his way,
we will do nothing.
We will hide within our walls...
...live our lives away from the light...
...and let darkness descend.
Are we not part of this world?
Tell me, mellon.
When did we let evil
become stronger than us?
Hello, Bard. What you after?
There was a tapestry!
An old one! Where's it gone?
What tapestry you talking about?
This one.
They were Dwarves, I tell you.
Appeared...
...out of nowhere.
Full beards. Fierce eyes.
I've never seen the like.
What are Dwarves doing in these parts?
- It's the prophecy.
- The prophecy?
The Prophecy of Durin's Folk.
Prophecy.
Prophecy.
The old tales will come true.
Vast halls of treasure!
Can it really be true?
Has the lord of silver fountains returned?
The lord of the silver fountains
The King of carven stone
The King beneath the mountain
Shall come into his own!
And the bell shall ring in gladness
At the Mountain
King's return
But all shall fail in sadness
And the lake will shine and burn
Da, I tried to stop them.
How long have they been gone?
- Can you see anything?
- Shh! Keep it down.
As soon as we have the
weapons, we make straight for the mountain.
Go, go, go.
Go, Nori.
Next.
You all right?
I can manage.
Let's just get out of here.
Run!
Quickly! Move now!
Get off me! Get off!
Move them along here.
Move on!
What is the meaning of this?
- We caught them stealing weapons, sire.
- Ah.
Enemies of the state, eh?
A desperate bunch of...
...mercenaries, if ever there was, sire.
Hold your tongue!
You do not know to whom you speak.
This is no common criminal.
This is Thorin...
...son of Thrain, son of Thror!
We are the Dwarves of Erebor.
We have come to reclaim our homeland.
I remember this town
in the great days of old.
Fleets of boats lay at harbor...
...filled with silks and fine gems.
This was no forsaken town on a lake.
This was the center of all trade
in the North!
I would...
...see those days return.
I would relight the great forges
of the Dwarves...
...and send wealth and riches...
...flowing once more
from the Halls of Erebor!
Death!
That is what you will...
...bring upon us!
Dragon fire and ruin.
If you waken that beast...
...it will destroy us all.
You can listen to this naysayer...
...but I promise you this:
If we succeed...
...all will share in the wealth
of the mountain.
You will have enough gold
to rebuild Esgaroth...
...10 times over!
All of you!
Listen to me!
You must listen!
Have you forgotten
what happened to Dale?
Have you forgotten those...
...who died in the firestorm?!
And for what purpose?
The blind ambition of a Mountain King...
...so riven by greed, he could not...
...see beyond his own desire!
Now, now!
We must not, any of us...
...be too quick to lay blame.
Let us...
...not forget that it was...
...Girion, Lord of Dale...
...your ancestor...
...who failed to kill the beast!
It's true, sire.
We all know the story.
Arrow after arrow, he shot.
Each one missing its mark.
You have no right.
No right to enter that mountain.
I have the only right.
I speak to the Master...
...of the Men of the Lake.
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?
Will you...
...share in the great wealth
of our people?
What say you?
I say unto you...
Welcome!
Welcome!
And thrice...
...welcome...
...King Under the Mountain!
You do know we're one short.
Where's Bofur?
- If he's not here, we leave him behind.
- We'll have to.
If we're to find the door before...
...nightfall, we can risk no more delays.
Not you.
We must travel at speed.
You will slow us down.
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you.
Not now.
I'm going to be there
when that door is opened.
When we first look upon
the Halls of our Fathers, Thorin.
Kili, stay here.
Rest.
Join us when you're healed.
I'll stay with the lad.
My duty lies with the wounded.
Uncle.
We grew up on tales of the mountain.
Tales you told us.
You cannot take that away...
- ...from him!
- Fili.
I will carry him if I must!
One day you will be king
and you will understand.
I cannot risk the fate of this quest
for the sake of one Dwarf.
Not even my own kin.
Fili, don't be a fool.
You belong with the company.
I belong with my brother.
By my beard, is that the time?! Ah!
Go now with our goodwill...
...and good wishes.
- And may your return bring good fortune...
- Wait!
...to all!
Goodbye.
Out of the way!
No! No!
Ha. So you missed the boat as well?
Kili? Kili!
No.
I'm done with Dwarves. Go away.
No, no...
...no! Please!
No one will help us. Kili's sick.
He's very sick.
What is this place?
It was once the city of Dale.
Now it is a ruin.
The desolation of Smaug.
The sun will soon reach midday.
We must find the hidden door
into the mountain before it sets.
This way.
Wait. Is this the overlook?
Gandalf said to meet him here.
- On no account were we to...
- Do you see him?
We have no time...
...to wait upon the Wizard.
We're on our own. Come!
Dol Guldur.
The Hill of Sorcery.
It looks completely abandoned.
As it is meant to.
A spell of concealment...
...lies over this place, which means...
...our Enemy is not yet ready
to reveal himself.
He has not regained his full strength.
Radagast, I need you to carry
a message to the Lady Galadriel.
Tell her we must force his hand.
What do you mean?
I'm going in alone.
On no account come after me.
Do I have your word?
Yes, yes, yes!
Wait, Gandalf!
What if it's a trap?!
Turn around and do not come back.
It's undoubtedly a trap.
Anything?
Nothing!
If the map is true...
...then the hidden door
lies directly above us.
Up here!
You have keen eyes, Master Baggins.
This must be it.
The hidden door.
Let all those who doubted us...
...rue this day!
Right, then. We have a key.
Which means that somewhere...
...there is a key-hole.
"The last light of Durin's Day...
...will shine upon...
...the key-hole."
Nori.
We're losing the light. Come on.
Be quiet! I can't
hear when you're thumping.
I can't find it.
It's not here!
It's not here!
- Break it down!
- Aye.
Come on!
Break!
It has to break.
It's no good.
The door's sealed. Can't
be opened by force.
There's a powerful magic on it.
No!
"The last light of Durin's Day...
...will shine upon the key-hole."
That is what it says.
What did we miss?
What did we miss?
Balin?
We've lost the light.
There's no more to be done.
We had but...
...one chance.
Come away, lads.
It's over.
- Wait a minute.
- We're too late.
Where are they going?
You can't give up now!
Thorin.
You can't give up now.
"Stand by the gray stone...
...when the thrush knocks."
The setting sun.
And "the last light of Durin's Day
will shine..."
The last light.
Last light.
The last light!
The key-hole!
Come back!
Come back!
It's the light of the moon! The last...
...moon of autumn! Ha, ha, ha!
Where's the key? Where's the key?
Where's the...?
It was here.
Come on, it was... It was here.
It was just...
Erebor.
Thorin.
I know these walls.
These halls.
This stone.
You remember it...
...Balin.
Chambers filled with golden light.
I remember.
"Herein lies...
...the Seventh Kingdom of...
...Durin's Folk.
May the Heart of the Mountain
unite all...
...Dwarves in defense of this home."
The Throne of the King.
Ah.
And what's that above it?
The Arkenstone.
Arkenstone.
And what's that?
That, Master Burglar...
...is why you are here.
Can you not do something?
I need herbs.
Something to bring down his fever.
I have nightshade. I have feverfew.
They're no use to me.
Do you have any kingsfoil?
No, it's a weed. We feed it to the pigs.
Pigs?
Weed.
Right.
Don't move.
You want me to find a jewel?
A large, white jewel.
Yes.
That's it? Only, I imagine
there's quite a few down there.
There is only one Arkenstone...
...and you'll know it when you see it.
Right.
In truth...
...lad...
...I do not know...
...what you will find down there.
You needn't go if you don't want to.
There's no dishonor in turning back.
No, Balin.
I promised I would do this...
...and I think I must try.
It never ceases to amaze me.
What's that?
The courage of Hobbits.
Go now...
...with as much luck as you can muster.
Oh, Bilbo?
If there is, in fact...
...a live dragon...
...down there...
...don't waken it.
Where is your master?
Where is he?!
Sauron!
Hello?
He's not at home.
Not at home. Ahem.
Good.
Good, good, good.
What's that?
Shush. Shush.
Arkenstone.
Arkenstone.
A large, white jewel.
Very helpful.
Well...
...thief.
I smell you.
I hear your breath.
I feel...
...your air.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Come, now...
...don't be shy.
Step into the light.
Hmm.
There is something about you.
Something you...
...carry.
Something made of gold.
But far more...
...precious.
Precious! Precious!
There you are...
...Thief in the...
...Shadows.
I did not come to steal from you...
...O Smaug...
...the Unassessably Wealthy.
I merely wanted...
...to gaze upon your magnificence.
To see...
...if you really were as great
as the old tales say.
I did not believe them.
And do you now?!
Truly...
...the tales and songs...
...fall utterly short of your enormity...
...O Smaug the Stupendous.
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?
No, no.
No, indeed.
You seem familiar with my name...
...but I don't remember smelling
your kind before.
Who are you...
...and where do you come from...
...may I ask?
I come from under the hill.
Underhill?
And under hills...
...and over hills my path has led.
And... And...
...through the air.
I am he who walks unseen.
Impressive.
What else do you claim to be?
I am...
Luck-wearer.
Riddle-maker.
Lovely titles.
Go on.
Barrel-rider.
Barrels? Now that is interesting.
And what about...
...your little Dwarf friends?
Where are they hiding?
Dwarves?
No.
No, no. No Dwarves here.
You've got that all wrong.
Oh, I don't think so, Barrel-rider!
They sent you in here...
...to do their dirty work while they...
...skulk about outside.
Truly...
...you are mistaken...
...O Smaug, Chiefest
and Greatest of Calamities.
You have nice manners...
...for a thief and...
...a liar!
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.
No one better!
It is the gold!
They are drawn...
...to treasure like...
...flies to dead flesh.
Did you think I did not know...
...this day would come?!
That a pack of...
...canting Dwarves...
...would come crawling back...
...to the mountain?!
Was that an earthquake?
That, my lad...
...was a dragon.
Da?
It's coming from the mountain.
You should leave us.
Take your children.
Get out of here.
And go where?
There is nowhere to go.
Are we going to die, Da?
No, darling.
The dragon.
It's going to kill us.
Not if I kill it first.
The King Under the Mountain is dead.
I took his throne.
I ate his...
...people like a wolf among sheep.
I kill where...
...I wish, when...
...I wish.
My armor is iron.
No blade can pierce me.
All right.
A Black Arrow? Why did you never tell me?
Because you did not need to know.
Listen to me carefully.
I need you to distract the guards.
Once I'm at the top of...
...the tower, I'll set
the arrow to the bow.
There he is!
Bard!
- After him!
- Quickly! Down there. Go!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Stop!
Bain! Bain.
Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find it.
I'll deal with them.
- I'm not leaving you.
- Now go!
Braga.
You're under arrest.
- On what charge?
- Any charge the Master chooses.
Where's he gone?
What about Bilbo?
Give him more time.
Time to do what? To be killed?
You're afraid.
Yes, I'm afraid.
I fear for you.
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard.
A sickness which drove...
...your grandfather mad.
I am not my grandfather.
You're not yourself.
The Thorin I know would not hesitate
to go in there...
I will not risk...
...this quest for the life of one burglar.
Bilbo.
His name is Bilbo.
It's Oakenshield...
...that filthy Dwarvish usurper.
He sent you in here...
...for the Arkenstone, didn't he?
No. No...
...no. I don't know
what you're talking about.
Don't bother denying it.
I guessed his foul purpose
some time ago.
But it matters not.
Oakenshield's quest will fail.
The darkness is coming.
It will spread to every corner of the land.
You are being used, Thief...
...in the Shadows.
You were only...
...ever a means to an end.
The coward...
...Oakenshield has weighed...
...the value of your life...
...and found it worth nothing.
No.
No.
No, you're lying.
What did he promise you?
A share of the treasure?
As if it was his...
...to give.
I will not part with...
...a single coin.
Not one piece of it.
My teeth...
...are swords.
My claws are spears.
My wings...
...are a hurricane.
So it is true.
The Black Arrow found its mark.
What did you say?
I was just saying your reputation
precedes you, O Smaug...
...the Tyrannical.
Truly.
You have no equal on this earth.
I am...
...almost tempted to let you take it.
If only to see Oakenshield...
...suffer.
Watch it...
...destroy him.
Watch it corrupt his heart...
...and drive him mad.
But I think not.
I think our little game ends here.
So tell me...
...thief...
...how do you choose to die?
Nah.
Da? Is that you, Da?
- Aah!
- Stay down!
Get down!
You killed them all.
There are others.
Tauriel.
Come.
We're losing him.
Tauriel.
Athelas.
Athelas.
What are you doing?
I'm going to save him.
- You're alive!
- Not for much longer.
- Did you find the Arkenstone? The Arkenstone.
- The dragon's coming.
Did you find it?
We have to get out.
Thorin.
Thorin.
You will burn!
- Run!
- Ah!
Come on, Bilbo!
Come on.
Hold him down.
Unh! Tilda.
Shh, shh, shh!
We've given him the slip.
No.
He's too cunning for that.
So where to now?
The western guardroom.
There may be a way out.
It's too high. There's no chance...
- ...that way.
- It's our only chance.
We have to try.
Come on.
I've heard tell of
the wonders of Elvish medicine.
That was a privilege to witness.
Tauriel.
Lie still.
You cannot be her.
She is far away.
She is far...
...far away from me.
She walks...
...in starlight in another world.
It was just a dream.
Do you think she could've loved me?
Stay close.
That's it, then.
There's no way out.
The last of our kin.
They must have come here...
...hoping...
...beyond hope.
We could try to reach the mines.
We might last a few days.
No.
I will not die like this.
Cowering.
Clawing for breath.
We make for the forges.
He'll see us, sure as death.
Not if we split up.
Thorin...
...we'll never make it.
Some of us might.
Lead him to the forges.
We kill the dragon.
If this is to end in fire...
...then we will all burn together.
This way.
Flee.
Flee.
Run for your lives.
There is...
...nowhere to hide.
Behind you!
Worm!
Come on!
Run!
Hey, you!
Here!
This way. It's this way!
Come on!
Thorin!
Follow Balin!
- Thorin.
- Come on!
Thorin!
Hold on!
Thorin!
Go. Go!
The plan's not gonna work.
These furnaces are stone cold.
He's right. We've no...
...fire hot enough to set them ablaze.
Have we not?
I did not look to see you
so easily outwitted.
You have grown...
...slow and fat...
...in your dotage...
...slug!
Take cover. Go!
Bombur!
Get those bellows working.
Go!
Bilbo!
Up there. On my mark...
...pull that lever.
Balin! Can you still mix a flash-flame?
Aye. It'll only take a jiffy. Come on!
We don't have a jiffy.
Where's the sulfur?
You sure you know what...
...you're doing?
Come on!
Now!
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings.
Keep going, Bilbo!
Run!
You think you...
...can deceive me, Barrel-rider?
You have come from Lake-town.
This is some...
...sordid scheme hatched between
these filthy Dwarves...
...and those miserable
tub-trading Lakemen.
Those sniveling cowards...
...with their long bows...
...and Black Arrows.
Perhaps it is time...
...I paid them a visit.
Oh, no.
This isn't their fault!
Wait!
You cannot go to Lake-town!
You care about them...
...do you?
Good.
Then you can...
...watch them die.
Here!
You witless worm.
You.
I am taking back what you stole.
You...
...will take nothing...
...from me...
...Dwarf.
I laid low your warriors...
...of old.
I instilled terror in...
...the hearts of Men.
I am...
...King Under...
...the Mountain.
This is not your kingdom.
These are Dwarf lands.
This is Dwarf gold.
And we will...
...have our revenge.
Revenge?!
Revenge?!
I will show you revenge!
Listen to me!
Do you not know what is coming?
I am fire.
I am...
...death.
What have we done?
I warned you.
Did I not warn you what would come
of dealing with Dwarves?
Now they've done it.
They've woken the dragon!
They've brought an apocalypse
upon our heads!
Come on. Quickly.
Quickly.
Faster now...
...I'm trying to evacuate.
Careful, man.
Never mind the books. Get on!
But, sire, should
we not try to save the town?
The town is lost.
- Save the gold!
- You heard him. Get a move on.
- Da!
- Come on.
Pile them up!
We have no time. We must leave.
- Get him up.
- Come on.
- Come on. Let's go.
- I'm fine. I can walk.
- Fast as you can.
- We're not leaving.
Not without our father.
If you stay here, your sisters will die.
Is that what your father would want?
Open...
...this door!
Do you hear me?
I can see him!
Look!
Down here! Now!
- Give me your hand.
- We gotta go.
Quickly now. Hurry.
Kili, come on!
- It's around the corner!
- Keep on going, man!
Dragon!
Come on, come on!
Faster! Faster!
If only we could take...
...more of these people with us,
but they're hardly...
- Worth it. I quite agree.
- Help!
Help!
Look out!
Move it!
Move it!
Come on! Faster!
My gold! My gold!
We're carrying too much.
We need to dump something.
Quite right...
...Alfrid.
Faster! Faster!
Poor souls.
Da.
Da!
He hit it!
- He hit the dragon! He did!
- No.
He hit his mark! I saw.
His arrows cannot pierce its hide.
I fear nothing will.
What are you doing?
- Come back! Bain!
- Bain!
Bain!
Get back here!
- Bain!
- Leave him.
We cannot go back.
Bain!
Dad.
Bain! What are you doing?
You were supposed to leave!
- I came to help you.
- No!
Nothing can stop it now.
This might.
Bain.
You go back.
You get out of here. Now.
Dad!
Bain!
Stop, stop! Halt!
Halt!
Who are you...
...that would stand...
...against me?
Now, that is a pity.
What will you do now...
...Bowman?
You are...
...forsaken.
No help will come.
Now's our chance! Go!
Go!
Head for the open water!
Hmm.
Is that...
...your child?
You cannot...
...save him from the fire.
He will...
...burn!
Stay still, son.
Stay still.
Tell me...
...wretch...
...how now shall you challenge me?
You have nothing left...
...but your...
...death!
Bain.
Look at me.
You look at me.
Little to your left.
That's it.
Bain! Hold on!
What was that?
What happened?
It fell. I saw it.
It's dead.
Smaug is dead.
By my beard...
...I think he's right.
Look there!
The Ravens of Erebor
are returning to the Mountain.
Aye.
Word will spread.
Before long...
...every soul in Middle-earth will know...
...the dragon is dead!
You are not...
...alone...
...Mithrandir.
Help me!
Where's my baby?
Please!
Somebody help me!
Help!
Over there!
Da!
Da!
- Da!
- Da!
Aah! Why me?
Tauriel.
Kili!
Come on.
We're leaving!
They are your people. You must go.
Come with me.
I know how I feel. I'm not afraid.
You make me feel alive.
I can't.
Tauriel.
I don't know what that means.
I think you do.
One more!
Keep it.
As a promise.
These are dry. You'll need them.
- Thank you.
- Here.
Oi! Give me one of them.
I'll catch my death...
...in this cold.
Find your own!
You're not in charge,
Alfrid Lickspittle.
You are wrong.
In the absence of the Master...
...the power cedes to his deputy...
...which in this instance is my good self.
Now give me that blanket!
Master's deputy?
Don't make me laugh.
You're a sneak-thief.
I'll be dead before...
...I answer to you.
Maybe that can be arranged.
I wouldn't go turning on your own, Alfrid.
Not now.
- Da!
- Come here!
You're alive.
It's all right, darling.
It was Bard! He killed the dragon!
I saw it with me own eyes.
He brought the beast down!
Shot him dead...
...with a Black Arrow.
Thank you, Bard!
- Good man.
- Thank you!
You've saved us all!
Bless you.
All hail to the Dragon-Slayer!
All hail...
...King Bard!
I have said it many times.
This is a man of noble stock.
- A born leader!
- Do not call me that.
I'm not Master...
...of this town.
Where is he?
- Where's the Master?
- Halfway down the Anduin.
With all our coin, I don't doubt.
You would know.
You helped him empty...
- ...the treasury.
- No.
I tried to stop him.
- Liar!
- Cheat!
You're a mongrel!
I begged. I pleaded.
Away with him!
- Tar him!
- I said, "Master...
...no!
Think of the children."
Hang him!
"Will nobody think of the children?"
Ow!
To the tree with him!
- Hang him hard!
- Take him down!
Enough! Let him go!
Let him go!
Look around you!
Have you not...
...had your fill of death?
Winter is upon us.
We must look to our own.
To the sick and the helpless.
Those who can stand,
tend to the wounded.
Those who have strength, follow me.
We must salvage what we can.
What then? What'll we do then?
We find shelter.
Hello!
Bombur?
Bifur?
Anybody?
Wait!
Wait!
- It's Bilbo!
- He's alive!
Stop! Stop!
Stop.
You need to leave.
We all need to leave.
We only just got here.
I've tried talking, but he won't listen.
- What do you mean, laddie?
- Thorin!
Thorin. Thorin.
He's been down there for days.
He doesn't sleep. He barely eats.
He's not been himself. Not at all.
It's this place. Ahem.
I think a sickness lies on it.
Sickness?
What kind of sickness?
Fili.
Fili!
Fili!
Gold.
Gold beyond measure.
Beyond sorrow...
...and grief.
Behold...
...the great...
...treasure hoard of Thror.
Welcome...
...my sister-sons...
...to the Kingdom...
...of Erebor.
Balin!
Kili!
Thank Durin, you're alive.
Bombur!
You're alive!
- Any sign of it?
- Nothing yet.
Nothing here.
- Keep searching!
- That jewel could be anywhere.
The Arkenstone is in these halls.
- Find it!
- You heard him.
- Keep looking.
- All of you!
No one rests until...
...it is found.
I am almost tempted...
...to let you take it.
If only...
...to see Oakenshield...
...suffer.
Watch it...
...destroy him.
Watch it corrupt...
...his heart...
...and drive him mad.
I've got you.
Take only what you need.
We have a long march ahead.
Where will you go?
There is only one place.
The Mountain.
You are a genius, sire.
We can take refuge inside the Mountain.
It might smell a bit of dragon,
but the women can clean that up.
It'll be safe and warm and dry...
...and full of stores...
...bedding, clothing...
...the odd bit of gold.
What gold is in that Mountain is cursed.
We will take only
what was promised to us.
Only what we need to rebuild...
...our lives.
Here. Pull your weight.
News of the death of Smaug
will have spread through the lands.
Aye.
Others will now look to the Mountain...
...for its wealth...
...for its position.
What is it you know?
Nothing for certain.
It's what I fear may come.
You saw something out there.
The Orc I pursued out of Lake-town,
I know who he is.
Bolg, spawn of Azog the Defiler.
A Warg pack was waiting for him
on the outskirts of Esgaroth.
They fled into the North.
These Orcs were different
from the others.
They bore a mark
I have not seen for a long time.
The mark of Gundabad.
Gundabad?
An Orc stronghold...
...in the far North of the Misty Mountains.
You may tell my father...
...if there is no place for Tauriel,
there is no place for me.
Legolas.
It is your king's command.
I ride North. Will you come with me?
To where?
To Gundabad.
I come for Mithrandir...
...and I will leave with him.
If you try to stop me...
...I will destroy you.
Nine...
...for mortal Men doomed to die.
I am not alone.
Are you in need of assistance, my lady?
You should've stayed...
...dead.
Mithrandir...
...come back.
He is here.
Yes.
The darkness has returned.
Go on!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
Climb on!
He is weak.
He cannot remain here.
It is draining his life.
Go!
Quickly!
Come with me, my lady.
Go!
You have no...
...power here...
...servant of Morgoth.
You...
...are nameless.
Faceless.
Formless.
Go back to the void...
...from whence you came!
The spirit of Sauron endured.
And has been banished.
He will flee into the East.
Gondor...
...should be warned.
They must set a watch
on the walls of Mordor.
No.
Look after the Lady Galadriel.
She has spent much of her power.
Her strength is failing.
Take her to Lothlrien.
My Lord Saruman.
He must be hunted down...
...and destroyed once and for all.
Without the Ring of Power...
...Sauron can never again
hold dominion over Middle-earth.
Go now.
Leave Sauron to me.
- I need that horse.
- What?
- Gandalf, where are you going?
- To warn Erebor.
They have no idea what is coming.
I saw them...
...with my own eyes,
rank upon rank of Moria Orcs.
You must summon our friends,
bird and beast.
The battle for the Mountain
is about to begin.
Wait.
Take this.
If what you say is true,
then you'll need it more than I.
Thank you.
A word of warning, eh?
It can be a bit dicky sometimes.
You just have to twiddle with the top.
I expect you'll manage.
It is here in these halls.
I know it.
We have searched and searched.
Not well enough.
Thorin, we all would see
the stone returned.
And yet, it is still not found!
Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here?
The Arkenstone...
...is the birthright of our people.
It is The King's Jewel.
Am I not the king?
Know this:
If anyone should find it...
...and withhold it from me...
...I will be avenged.
Dragon-sickness.
I've seen it before.
That look.
The terrible need.
It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo.
It sent his grandfather mad.
Balin, if Thorin...
...had the Arkenstone...
...or if...
...it was found...
...would it help?
That stone crowns all.
It is the summit of this great wealth...
...bestowing power...
...upon he who bears it.
Would it stay his madness?
No, laddie.
I fear it would make him worse.
Perhaps it is best...
...it remains lost.
What is that?
In your hand.
It's nothing.
Show me.
It...
I picked it up in Beorn's garden.
You've carried it all this way?
I'm gonna plant it in my garden.
In Bag End.
It's a poor prize to
take back to the Shire.
One day, it'll grow.
And every time I look at it, I'll remember.
Remember everything that happened,
the good, the bad...
...and how lucky I am that I made it home.
Thorin, I...
Thorin.
Survivors from Lake-town...
...they're streaming into Dale.
There's hundreds of them.
Call everyone to the gate.
To the gate!
Now!
Come on.
- Keep moving.
- Sire!
Sire!
Up here!
Look, sire! The braziers are lit.
So...
...the Company of Thorin Oakenshield
survived.
Survived?
There's a bunch of Dwarves
with all that gold?
I shouldn't worry, Alfrid.
There's gold enough
in that Mountain for all.
Make camp here tonight!
Find what shelter you can.
Get some fires going.
- Come on, hurry along now.
- Alfrid.
You'll take...
...the night watch.
Up it goes!
That's it.
I want this fortress made safe by sunup.
This Mountain was hard-won.
I will not see it taken again.
The people of Lake-town have nothing.
They came to us in need.
They have lost everything.
Do not tell me what they have lost.
I know well enough their hardship.
Those who have lived through dragon fire...
...should rejoice.
They have much...
...to be grateful for.
More stone.
Bring more stone to the gate!
That's it.
- These children are starving.
- We need food.
- We won't last three days.
- Bard...
- ...we don't have enough.
- Do what you can, Percy.
It'll be all right. Don't worry.
We need more water.
The children, the wounded
and the women come first.
Here you are.
Good morning, Alfrid.
What news from the night watch?
All quiet, sire. Not much to report.
Nothing gets past me.
Except an army of Elves, it would seem.
My Lord Thranduil, we did not look...
- ...to see you here.
- I heard you needed aid.
Here you go.
Pass it back.
Another one.
You have saved us.
I do not know how to thank you.
Your gratitude is misplaced.
I did not come on your behalf.
I came to reclaim something of mine.
There are gems in the Mountain
that I, too, desire.
White gems of pure starlight.
The White Gems of Lasgalen.
I know an Elf Lord who will pay
a pretty price for these.
Wait! Please wait!
You would go to war
over a handful of gems?
The heirlooms of my people
are not lightly forsaken.
We are allies in this.
My people...
...also have a claim
upon the riches in that Mountain.
Let me...
...speak with Thorin.
You would try to reason with the Dwarf?
To avoid war?
Yes.
Not a bad night's work.
Come on.
Hail, Thorin, son of Thrain.
We are glad to find you alive beyond hope.
Why do you come to the gates...
...of the King under the Mountain
armed for war?
Why does the King under the Mountain
fence himself in...
...like a robber in his hold?
Perhaps it is because
I am expecting to be robbed.
My lord...
...we have not come to rob you...
...but to seek fair settlement.
Will you not speak with me?
I am listening.
On behalf of the people of Lake-town...
...I ask that you honor your pledge.
A share of the treasure...
...so that they might rebuild their lives.
I will not treat with any man...
...while an armed host lies before my door.
That armed host will attack this Mountain
if we do not come to terms.
And your threats do not sway me.
What of your conscience?
Does it not tell you our cause is just?
My people offered you help.
And in return, you brought upon them
only ruin and death.
When did Lake-town come to our aid
but for the promise of rich reward?
A bargain was struck!
A bargain?
What choice did we have
but to barter our birthright...
...for blankets and food?
To ransom...
...our future in exchange
for our freedom?
You call that a fair trade?
Tell me...
...Bard the Dragon-Slayer...
...why should I honor such terms?
Because you gave us your word.
Does that mean nothing?
Be gone!
Ere our arrows...
...fly!
What are you doing?
You cannot go to war.
- This does not concern you.
- Excuse me...
...but in case you haven't noticed,
there is an army of Elves out there.
Not to mention several hundred
angry fishermen.
We are, in fact, outnumbered.
Not for much longer.
What does that mean?
It means, Master Baggins...
...you should never underestimate Dwarves.
We have reclaimed Erebor.
Now...
...we defend it.
He will give us nothing.
Such a pity.
Still...
- ...you tried.
- I do not understand.
Why?
Why would he risk war?
It is fruitless to reason with them.
They understand...
...only one thing.
We attack at dawn.
Are you with us?
Aye.
Master Baggins, come here.
You're going to need this.
Put it on.
This vest is made of silver steel.
Mithril...
...it was called by my forebears.
No blade can pierce it.
I look absurd.
I'm not a warrior, I'm a Hobbit.
It is a gift.
A token of our friendship.
True friends are hard to come by.
I have been blind...
...but now I begin to see.
I am betrayed.
Betrayed?
The Arkenstone.
One of them has taken it.
One of them is false.
Thorin...
...the Quest is fulfilled,
you've won the Mountain.
Is that not enough?
- Betrayed by my own kin.
- Now, uh...
...you made a promise
to the people of Lake-town.
Now, is this treasure...
...truly worth more than your honor?
Our honor, Thorin. I was also there.
I gave my word.
For that, I am grateful.
It was nobly done, but the treasure...
...does not belong to the people...
...of Lake-town.
This gold...
...is ours.
And ours alone.
By my life...
...I will not part...
...with a single coin.
Not...
...one...
...piece of it.
Gundabad.
What lies beyond?
An old enemy.
The ancient kingdom...
...of Angmar.
This fortress was once its stronghold.
It is where they kept their great armories.
Forged their weapons of war.
A light. I saw movement.
We wait for the cover of night.
It is a fell place, Tauriel.
In another age, our people waged war...
...on those lands.
My mother died there.
My father does not speak of it.
There is no grave.
No memory.
Nothing.
- Unh!
- Let me through!
Make way!
No, no.
No! Oi! You!
Pointy hat!
Yes.
You. We don't want no tramps, beggars...
...nor vagabonds here.
We got enough trouble
without the likes of you.
Off you go. On your horse.
Who's in charge here?
Who is asking?
You must set aside
your petty grievances with the Dwarves.
War is coming!
The cesspits...
...of Dol Guldur have been...
...emptied.
You're all...
...in mortal danger.
What are you talking about?
You know nothing...
...of Wizards.
They are like winter thunder
on a wild wind...
...rolling in from a distance,
breaking hard in alarm.
But sometimes a storm...
...is just a storm.
Not this time.
Armies of Orcs are on the move.
These are fighters.
They have been bred for war.
Our enemy has summoned his full strength.
Why show his hand now?
Because we forced him.
We forced him when the Company of Thorin
set out to reclaim...
...their homeland.
The Dwarves were never meant
to reach Erebor.
Azog the Defiler was sent to kill them.
His master seeks control of the Mountain.
Not just for the treasure within...
...but for where it lies,
its strategic position.
This is the gateway...
...to reclaiming
the lands of Angmar in the North.
If that fell kingdom should rise again...
...Rivendell, Lrien, the Shire...
...even Gondor itself, will fall.
These Orc armies you speak of,
Mithrandir...
...where are they?
These bats are bred for one purpose.
For what?
For war.
Come on, let's get those blades sharpened.
Aye. Blasted Elves.
- You swing an ax at it?
- No, brother.
You should be inside.
Out of the wind.
No, I...
...needed some air.
Place still stinks of dragon.
The Elves have been moving...
- ...their archers into position.
- Ah.
The battle will be over...
...by tomorrow's eve.
Though I doubt we will live
to see it.
No, these are dark days.
Dark days indeed.
Hmm.
No one could blame a soul
for wishing themselves elsewhere.
Must be nearing midnight.
Bombur's got the next watch.
It'll take a bit to wake him.
Bofur?
I will see you in the morning.
Goodbye, Bilbo.
Since when has my counsel
counted for so little?
What do you think I'm trying to do?
Save your Dwarvish friends,
and I admire...
...your loyalty to them.
But it does not dissuade me
from my course.
You started this, Mithrandir.
You will forgive me if I finish it.
Are the archers in position?
- Yes, my lord.
- Give the order.
If anything moves on that Mountain...
...kill it.
The Dwarves are out of time.
Bowman!
Do you agree?
Is gold so important to you?
Would you buy it
with the blood of Dwarves?
It won't come to that.
- This is a fight they cannot win.
- That won't stop them.
You think the Dwarves will surrender?
They won't.
They will fight to the death.
Bilbo Baggins.
If I'm not mistaken...
...this is the Halfling
who stole the keys...
...to my dungeons from under...
...the nose of my guards.
Yes.
Sorry...
...about that.
I came...
...to give you...
...this.
The Heart of the Mountain.
The King's Jewel.
And worth a king's ransom.
How is this...
...yours to give?
I took it as my 14th share
of the treasure.
Why would you do this?
You owe us no loyalty.
I'm not doing it for you.
I know that Dwarves can be obstinate...
...and pigheaded...
...and difficult.
They're suspicious and secretive...
...with the worst manners...
...imaginable,
but they are also brave...
...and kind...
...and loyal to a fault.
I've grown...
...very fond of them,
and I would save them if I can.
Now, Thorin...
...values this stone above all else.
In exchange for its return,
he will give you...
...what you are owed.
There will be no need...
...for war.
Rest up tonight.
- You must leave on the morrow.
- What?
- Get as far away from here as possible.
- I'm not leaving.
You picked me as the 14th man.
I'm not leaving the Company.
There is no Company. Not anymore.
Imagine what Thorin will do
when he finds out what you've done.
I'm not afraid of Thorin.
Well, you should be.
Don't underestimate...
...the evil of gold.
Gold over which...
...a serpent has long brooded.
Dragon-sickness seeps
into the hearts of all...
...who come near this Mountain.
Almost all. Heh.
You there.
Find this Hobbit a bed...
...and fill his belly with hot food.
He's earned it.
Hey.
Keep an eye on him.
If he should try...
...to leave, you tell me.
Move it!
Stupid Hobbit.
Wakey-wakey, Hobbit. Up you get.
I will put the next one between your eyes.
We have come to tell you...
...payment of your debt has been offered...
...and accepted.
What payment?
I gave you nothing.
You have nothing.
We have this.
They have the Arkenstone.
Thieves!
How came you by the heirloom
of our house?
That stone belongs to the king!
And the king may have it...
...with our goodwill.
But first he must honor his word.
They are taking us for fools.
This is a ruse.
A filthy lie.
The Arkenstone is in this Mountain!
It is a trick!
It's no trick.
The stone is real.
I gave it to them.
You?
I took it as my 14th share.
You would steal from me?
Steal from you? No.
No, I may be a burglar,
but I like to think I'm an honest one.
I'll let it stand against my claim.
Against your claim?
Your claim.
You have no claim over me,
you miserable rat!
I was going to give it to you.
- Many times I wanted to, but...
- But what...
...thief?
You are changed, Thorin.
The Dwarf I met...
...in Bag End would never have
gone back on his word.
Would never have doubted...
...the loyalty of his kin!
Do not speak to me...
...of loyalty.
Throw him from the rampart!
Did you not hear me?
I will do it myself. Curse you!
No!
Cursed be the Wizard...
- ...that forced you on us!
- If you don't like my burglar...
...then please...
...don't damage him.
Return him to me.
You're not making a very splendid figure
as King under the Mountain...
...are you, Thorin...
...son of Thrain?
Never again will I have dealings
with Wizards!
Go.
Or Shire rats!
Are we resolved?
The return...
...of the Arkenstone
for what was promised?
Why should I...
...buy back that which is...
...rightfully mine?
Keep the stone...
...sell it.
Ecthelion of Gondor
will give you a good price for it.
I will kill you!
By my oath,
I will kill you all!
Your oath means nothing.
I've heard enough.
Thorin...
...lay down your arms.
Open these doors.
This treasure...
...will be your death.
Thorin, we cannot...
...win this fight.
Give us your answer.
Will you have peace...
...or war?
I will have war.
Ironfoot.
Hey, Thorin!
Ironfoot has come!
Who is that?
He doesn't look very happy.
It is Dain, Lord of the Iron Hills.
Thorin's...
- ...cousin.
- Are they alike?
I've always found Thorin
the more reasonable of the two.
Good morning.
How are we all?
I have a wee proposition...
...if you wouldn't mind giving me
a few moments...
...of your time.
Would you consider...
...just sodding off?
All of you!
Right now!
Stand fast.
Come now, Lord Dain.
Gandalf the Grey.
Tell this rabble...
...to leave, or I'll water...
...the ground with their blood!
No need for war...
...between Dwarves, Men and Elves.
A legion of Orcs...
...march on the Mountain.
Stand down.
I will not stand down before any Elf.
Not least this faithless Woodland sprite.
He wishes nothing but ill upon my people.
If he chooses...
...to stand between me and my kin...
...I'll split his pretty head open!
See if he's still smirking then.
Dain...
...wait!
Let them advance.
See how far they get.
You think I give a dead dog
for your threats...
...you pointy-eared...
...princess?
You hear that, lads? We're on!
Let's give these bastards
a good hammering!
Stand your men down.
I'll deal with Ironfoot and his rabble.
Right then.
Let's get this done.
Send in the goats.
Thranduil!
This is madness!
How do you like that,
the old twirley-whirlies?
Ha, ha, you buggers!
Were-worms.
Oh, come on.
The hordes of hell are upon us!
Fight to the death!
I'm going over the wall.
Who's coming with me?
- Aye!
- Come on, let's go!
- Stand down.
- What?
Are we to do nothing?
I said, stand down!
The Elves.
Will they not fight?
Charge!
Yes!
Uh, Gandalf?
Is this a good place to stand?
Azog.
He's trying to cut us off.
All of you!
Fall back to Dale!
Now!
To the city!
Bilbo! This way!
Sigrid!
Tilda!
My children! Where are my children?
I saw them!
They were down in the old market!
The market?
Where are they now?
Tilda! Sigrid!
Bard! Orcs are storming over the causeway!
Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet.
Hold them off as long as you can.
Archers! This way!
The Orcs have taken Stone Street!
The market's overrun!
The rest of you...
...follow me!
Charge! Onward!
To the death!
Da!
Da!
- Here!
- We're down here!
Bain!
Sigrid! Get down!
Listen!
Gather...
...the women and children.
Take them to the Great Hall...
...and barricade the door.
You understand?
You must not come out for any reason.
We want to stay with you!
Show your father some respect.
You leave it to me...
...sire.
You heard him.
- We make for the Great Hall.
- Alfrid!
Women and children only.
I need every man...
...fighting.
See that you return.
I'll get them to safety, sire.
Then my sword is yours to command.
Get up!
Look after them.
Shift it, granny!
Make for the Great Hall!
Out of my way!
Abandon the cripples!
You buggers!
Where's Thorin?
We need him! Where is he?
Fall back!
Since when do we forsake...
...our own people?
Thorin...
...they are dying...
...out there.
There are halls beneath halls
within this Mountain.
Places we can fortify...
...shore up, make safe.
Yes.
Yes...
...that is it.
We must move the gold
further underground...
- ...to safety.
- Did you hear me?
Dain is surrounded.
They're being slaughtered, Thorin.
Many die in war.
Life is cheap.
But a treasure...
...such as this cannot be counted...
...in lives lost.
It is worth...
...all the blood we can spend.
You sit here in these vast halls...
...with a crown upon your head...
...and yet you are lesser now
than you have ever been.
Do not speak to me...
...as if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord...
...as if...
...I were still...
...Thorin...
...Oakenshield.
- I am your king!
- You were always my king.
You used to know that once.
You cannot see what you have become.
Go.
Get out.
Before I kill you.
You sit here...
...with a crown upon your head.
You are lesser now
than you have ever been.
But a treasure such as this
cannot be counted in lives lost.
A sickness lies upon that treasure.
The blind ambition of a Mountain King.
Am I not the king?
This gold...
...is ours.
And ours alone.
I will not part...
...with a single coin.
He could not see
beyond his own desire!
As if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord...
...Thorin Oakenshield.
A sickness which drove
your grandfather mad.
This is Thorin...
...son of Thrain, son of Thror!
I am not my grandfather.
I am not my grandfather.
You are the heir to the Throne of Durin.
They are dying out there.
Take back Erebor.
Dain is surrounded.
Dying.
Is surrounded.
Dying.
Take back your homeland.
You are changed, Thorin.
I am not my grandfather.
Is this treasure truly worth more
than your honor?
I am not my grandfather.
This treasure will be your death!
Fall back!
Fall back...
...to the Mountain!
Fall back!
I will not hide...
...behind a wall of stone...
...while others fight our battles for us!
It is not in my blood, Thorin.
No.
It is not.
We are sons of Durin.
And Durin's Folk...
...do not flee from a fight.
I have no right to ask this of any of you.
But will you follow me...
...one last time?
Thorin.
To the king!
To the king!
The Dwarves.
They're rallying.
They're rallying to their king.
Any man who wants to give their last...
...follow me!
Come on, Bombur. Get up.
- Nori.
- Gloin!
Right behind you, brother.
I say we stand with our men
in life and in death.
- I'm with you.
- Arm yourselves.
- Come with us.
- No, no, no.
- You leave an old woman be.
- Don't be afraid.
I said, get off!
Alfrid Lickspittle.
You are a coward.
"Coward"?
Not every man's brave enough
to wear a corset.
You're not a man.
You're a weasel.
Dain!
Thorin!
Hold on!
I'm coming!
Hey, cousin!
What took you so long?
There's too many of these buggers, Thorin.
I hope you've got a plan.
Aye.
We're going to take out their leader.
Azog?
I'm gonna kill that piece of filth.
Thorin, you cannot do this.
You're our king.
That is why I must do it.
And how do you plan to fight your way
single-handed to Ravenhill?
Halt!
It's been a while since I've done this.
To Ravenhill!
Hold tight, lads.
You're all mad bastards.
I like it.
May Durin save you all.
Watch out!
Eyes front...
...lads!
Hold on!
I'm out!
Bring it down!
- Shoot it!
- Where?
In his jambags!
It doesn't have any jambags!
- Duck!
- Kili!
Move it!
Hang on, lads! I'm coming!
Bofur, you beauty!
- Dwalin!
- Go!
Come on...
...you hairy hedgepig!
Come on!
Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Wargs!
Hold tight, lads.
There's more coming!
We're pulling too much weight.
We won't make it.
Cut the tracers.
Ride them to Ravenhill.
No, Balin.
My goat-riding days are over.
Durin be with you, brother.
I am too old for this.
Hyah!
Onwards!
Lead on!
Get up.
Get away from me.
I don't take orders...
...from you.
People trusted you.
They listened to you.
The Master's mantle...
...was there for the taking...
...and you threw it all away.
For what?
Alfrid...
...your slip is showing.
We may yet survive this.
Gandalf!
It's Thorin.
And Fili, Kili...
...and Dwalin.
He's taking his best warriors.
To do what?
To cut the head off the snake.
Die!
Gandalf!
Legolas.
Legolas Greenleaf.
There is a second army.
Bolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs.
They are almost upon us.
Gundabad.
This was their plan all along.
Azog engages our forces,
then Bolg sweeps in from the North.
The North?
Where is the North...
- ...exactly?
- Ravenhill.
Ravenhill?
Thorin is up there.
And Fili and Kili. They're all up there.
Where is he?
It looks empty.
I think Azog has fled.
I don't think so.
Fili...
...take your brother.
Scout out the towers.
Keep low and out of sight.
If you see something...
...report back. Do not engage.
- Do you understand?
- We have company.
Goblin mercenaries.
No more than a hundred.
We'll take care of them. Go!
Go!
Come on!
Recall your company.
My lord, dispatch this force...
...to Ravenhill.
The Dwarves are about...
...to be overrun.
Thorin must be warned.
By all means, warn him.
I have spent enough Elvish blood
in defense...
...of this accursed land. No more.
Thranduil?
I'll go.
Don't be ridiculous.
You'll never make it.
Why not?
Because they will see you coming
and kill you.
No, they won't.
They won't see me.
It's out of the question.
I won't allow it.
I'm not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.
You will not turn away.
Not this time.
Get out of my way.
The Dwarves will be slaughtered.
Yes, they will die.
Today...
...tomorrow...
...one year hence,
a hundred years from now.
What does it matter?
They are mortal.
You think your life is worth more...
...when there is no love in it?
There is no love in you.
What do you know of love?
Nothing.
What you feel for that Dwarf...
...is not real.
You think it is love?
Are you ready to die for it?
I will go with you.
Push!
By Durin, you've lost your ax.
No, he's not.
There you go, cousin.
You know where you can stick that.
Hey. Stay here.
Search the lower levels.
I've got this.
Where is that Orc filth?
Thorin.
Bilbo.
You have to leave here. Now.
Azog has an army attacking
from the North.
This watchtower will be surrounded.
- With no way out.
- We are so close.
That Orc scum is in there.
I say we push on.
No. That's what he wants.
He wants to draw us in.
This is a trap.
Ah.
Find Fili and Kili. Call them back.
Thorin, are you sure about this?
Do it.
We'll live to fight another day.
Oh...
Go.
Run!
Kili!
Thorin.
Thorin. No.
No.
Kili.
Kili!
Kili!
Tauriel!
Kili.
No!
No!
Mm.
Tauriel!
The Eagles are coming.
Bilbo.
Don't move. Don't move. Lie still.
Oh. Mm. Mm.
I'm glad you are here.
- Shh, shh.
- Unh.
I wish to part from you in friendship.
No.
You are not going anywhere.
You're going to live.
I would take back...
...my words and my deeds at the Gate.
You did what only a true friend would do.
Forgive me.
I was too blind to see it.
I am so sorry...
...that I have led you into such peril.
No, I'm glad to have shared
in your perils, Thorin.
Each and every one of them.
It is far more than any Baggins deserves.
Farewell...
...Master Burglar.
Go back to your books.
And your armchair.
Plant your trees.
Watch them grow.
If more people...
...valued home...
...above gold...
...this world would be a merrier place.
No. No, no, no. No.
Thorin. Thorin, don't you dare.
Thorin.
Thorin. Thorin, hold on.
Hold on, please.
The Eagles...
The Eagles... The Eagles are here.
Thorin?
The Ea...
I cannot go back.
Where will you go?
I do not know.
Go north.
Find the Dnedain.
There's a young Ranger amongst them.
You should meet him.
His father, Arathorn, was a good man.
His son...
...might grow to be a great one.
What is his name?
He's known in the Wild as Strider.
His true name...
...you must discover for yourself.
Legolas.
Your mother loved you.
More than anyone.
More than life.
They want to bury him.
Yes.
If this is love, I do not want it.
Take it from me.
Please.
Why does it hurt so much?
Because it was real.
The king is dead.
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
There is to be a great feast tonight.
Songs will be sung. Tales will be told.
And Thorin Oakenshield...
...will pass into legend.
I know that's how you must honor him.
But to me, he was never that.
He was...
To me...
...he was...
I'll slip quietly away.
Will you tell the others I said goodbye?
You can tell them yourself.
If any of you are ever
passing Bag End, uh...
...tea is at 4.
There's plenty of it.
You are welcome anytime.
Uh...
Don't bother knocking.
Ah, the borders of the Shire.
It is here I must leave you.
That's a shame.
I quite liked having...
...a Wizard around.
Seems they bring good luck.
You don't really suppose, do you,
that all your adventures and escapes...
...were managed by mere luck?
Magic rings should not be used lightly,
Bilbo.
Don't take me for a fool.
I know you found one in the Goblin tunnels.
And I've kept my eye on you...
...ever since.
Well, thank goodness.
Farewell, Gandalf.
Farewell.
You, uh...
You needn't worry about that ring.
Fell out of my pocket during the battle.
I lost it.
You're a very fine person, Mr. Baggins.
And I'm very fond...
...of you.
But you're only quite a little fellow...
...in a wide world after all.
Wait a minute,
that's my mother's glory box.
And that's my dining chair.
Ah... Put that pouf down!
What is going on?
Hello...
...Mr. Bilbo.
You're not supposed to be here.
What do you mean?
On account of you
being presumed dead.
I am not dead.
Presumed or otherwise.
I'm not sure that's permitted.
Mr. Bilbo!
Twenty-one! Any advance on 21?
Any advance on 21?
Ha, ha! Sold to Mrs. Bolger.
Somewhere for Fatty to put his feet on.
Any bids for this?
This is Shire-made.
No Dwarvish reproductions here.
Stop!
Stop!
- There's been a mistake!
- Who are you?
Who am I?
You know who I am...
...Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.
This is my home.
And those are my spoons.
Thank you very much.
- This is most irregular.
- Excuse me.
It's been more...
...than 13 months since the disappearance.
If you are in fact...
...Bilbo Baggins and undeceased...
...can you prove it?
What?
Something official with your name...
...on it would suffice.
All right. Right.
A contract of employment as a bur...
Never mind as what.
There. My signature.
Yes, well... Uh...
Well, it certainly seems to be in order.
Yes.
Seems there can be no doubt.
Who is this you pledged
your service to?
Thorin Oakenshield?
He...
He was my friend.
No, thank you!
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers...
...or distant relations!
And what about...
...very old friends?
Gandalf?
Bilbo Baggins.
My dear Gandalf! Ha, ha!
It's good to see you.
One hundred and 11 years old.
Who would believe it?
Come on, come in!
Welcome. Welcome.
