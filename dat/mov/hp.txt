I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.
Are the rumors true, Albus?
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.
Try not to wake him.
There you go.
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.
- They really are...
- The only family he has.
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.
Exactly.
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.
Until he's ready.
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.
Good luck...
...Harry Potter.
Up. Get up!
Now!
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...
...for my Dudley's special day!
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.
Aren't they wonderful, darling?
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.
36?! But last year I had 37!
- But some are bigger than last year's.
- I don't care!
This is what we're going to do.
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.
I'm warning you now, boy.
Any funny business, any at all...
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.
Get in.
Make it move.
Move!
- Move!
- He's asleep!
He's boring.
Sorry about him.
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.
Can you hear me?
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.
Do you...?
Do you talk to people often?
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?
Do you miss your family?
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!
Thanks.
Anytime.
Snake!
Mum! Mummy! Help me!
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.
There's no such thing as magic.
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
No more mail through this letterbox.
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.
Shoo! Go on.
Fine day, Sunday.
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!
No post on Sunday.
No blasted letters today! No, sir.
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...
Make it stop, please!
Stop it!
Mummy, what's happening?
Give me that! Give me that letter!
Get off!
They're my letters! Let go of me!
That's it! We're going away!
Far away, where they can't find us!
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?
Make a wish, Harry.
Who's there?
Sorry about that.
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.
I'm not Harry.
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.
Got something for you.
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.
Baked it myself, words and all.
Thank you.
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?
Excuse me, but who are you?
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?
Learned what?
You're a wizard, Harry.
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...
...I can't be a wizard.
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?
My perfect sister being who she was.
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.
A freak!
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!
He'll not be going.
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?
Muggle?
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...
...in front of me.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.
"All students must be equipped with...
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."
Can we find all this in London?
If you know where to go.
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.
Just helping Harry buy
his school supplies.
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Oh, nice to meet you.
Fearfully fascinating subject.
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.
Goodbye.
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.
Here, you get your quills and ink.
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.
It's a world-class racing broom.
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!
It's the fastest model yet.
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.
Best stay close.
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.
Ha! There's the little devil.
And there's something else as well.
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.
Very well.
Vault 687.
Lamp, please.
Key, please.
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.
Stand back.
Best not to mention this to anyone.
I still need a wand.
You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.
Run along there and wait.
I got one more thing to do.
Hello?
Hello?
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.
It seems only yesterday...
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.
Here we are.
Give it a wave.
Apparently not.
Perhaps...
...this.
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.
I wonder...
Curious.
Very curious.
Sorry, but what's curious?
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.
It so happens that the phoenix...
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.
Just one other.
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...
...when its brother
gave you that scar.
And who owned that wand?
We do not speak his name.
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.
It's not always clear why.
But I think it is clear...
...that we can expect
great things from you.
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...
...did great things.
Terrible...
...yes, but great.
Harry! Harry!
Happy birthday.
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.
First, and understand this
because it's very important:
Not all wizards are good.
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V...
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?
No, I can't spell it.
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?
It was dark times, Harry.
to gather some followers.
Brought them over to the Dark Side.
ended up dead.
Your parents fought against him.
he decided to kill them.
Nobody, not one.
Except you.
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.
What happened to V...?
To You-Know-Who?
Well, some say he died.
Codswallop, in my opinion.
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...
...too tired to carry on.
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.
You're the boy who lived.
What are you looking at?
Blimey, is that the time?
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.
"Platform 9 3/4?"
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.
There's no such thing, is there?
Sorry.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
On your left.
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3/4?
Think you're being funny, do you?
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles.
- Muggles?
- Platform 9 3/4, this way.
All right, Percy, you first.
Fred, you next.
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?
I'm sorry, George.
I'm only joking. I am Fred.
Excuse me.
Could you tell me how to...?
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.
Not at all.
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
So it's true!
I mean, do you really have the...?
- The what?
- The scar?
Wicked!
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.
We'll take the lot.
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...
...spinach, liver and tripe.
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.
Watch it!
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.
Hey, he's gone!
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic, isn't he?
A little.
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?
Yeah.
Has anyone seen a toad?
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...
...but they've all worked for me.
For example:
Oculus Reparo.
That's better, isn't it?
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?
Just there.
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.
Wicked.
Welcome to Hogwarts.
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.
Your triumphs will earn you points.
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points wins the house cup.
Trevor!
Sorry.
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.
Harry Potter?
This is Crabbe and Goyle.
And I'm Malfoy.
Draco Malfoy.
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.
I can help you there.
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.
I read about it
in "Hogwarts, A History".
Will you wait along here, please?
Now, before we begin...
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.
The first years, please note...
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.
Thank you.
When I call your name,
you will come forth.
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.
Hermione Granger.
Oh, no. Okay, relax.
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.
Right, then. Right.
Okay. Gryffindor!
Draco Malfoy.
Slytherin!
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.
Susan Bones.
Harry, what is it?
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.
Let's see...
I know! Hufflepuff!
Ronald Weasley.
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.
Gryffindor!
Harry Potter.
Difficult, very difficult.
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.
There's talent, oh, yes.
And a thirst to prove yourself.
But where to put you?
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.
No? Well, if you're sure.
Better be...
...Gryffindor!
Your attention, please.
Let the feast begin.
I'm half and half.
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.
- What's he teach?
- Potions.
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.
Hello! How are you?
Welcome to Gryffindor.
It's the Bloody Baron!
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?
Like this.
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.
That picture's moving.
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.
- Look!
- Who's that girl?
Welcome to Hogwarts.
Password?
Caput Draconis.
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.
Gather around here.
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.
Your belongings have
already been brought up.
Made it!
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.
However, for those select few...
...who possess the predisposition...
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...
...and ensnare the senses.
I can tell you how to bottle fame...
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts with abilities...
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...
...to not pay attention.
Mr. Potter.
Our new celebrity.
What would I get if I added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?
You don't know? Let's try again.
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?
I don't know, sir.
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?
I don't know, sir.
Pity.
Clearly, fame isn't everything...
...is it, Mr. Potter?
Turn this water into rum
Eye of rabbit...
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before...
Mail's here.
Can I borrow this? Thanks.
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken."
"The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day."
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.
Welcome to your first flying lesson.
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up".
Up!
Up.
Up.
Up. Up!
With feeling.
Shut up, Harry.
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.
When I blow my whistle, I want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.
On my whistle. Three, two...
Mr. Longbottom.
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!
Neville!
Come back down this instant!
Everyone out of the way!
Is he all right?
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.
Did you see his face?
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.
Give it here, Malfoy.
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.
How about on the roof?
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.
Besides, you don't know how to fly.
What an idiot.
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!
Is that so?
Have it your way, then.
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!
Harry Potter!
Follow me.
You wait here.
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?
Yes, of course.
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.
I always knew he'd do well.
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.
- You must be the youngest player in...
- A century, McGonagall says.
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.
But they'll turn up in a month or two.
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.
I didn't know.
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.
Who doesn't?
What's happening?
The staircases change, remember?
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?
We're not supposed to be here.
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.
Let's go.
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!
Quick, let's hide through that door!
- It's locked!
- We're done for!
Move over!
Alohomora.
Get in.
"Alohomora?"
Standard Book of Spells, 
chapter seven.
Anyone here, my sweet?
Come on.
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.
Or worse, expelled.
She needs to sort out her priorities.
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?
I think so. What are those?
You better take this.
Careful now, it's coming back.
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.
What was that?
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.
But you are a Seeker.
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.
The Golden Snitch.
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.
What do I do with it?
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.
You catch this, the game's over.
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...
...or the ability to make objects fly.
Do you have your feathers? Good.
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.
The swish and flick. Everyone.
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.
Wingardium Leviosa. 
Off you go, then.
Wingardium Leviosa.
Wingardium Leviosa.
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's "Leviosa", not "Leviosar".
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.
Wingardium Leviosa.
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!
Splendid!
Well done, dear.
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.
I think she heard you.
Where's Hermione?
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.
Troll in the dungeon!
Troll in the dungeon!
Thought you ought to know.
Silence!
Everyone will please not panic!
Now...
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.
How could a troll get in?
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.
I think the troll's left the dungeon.
It's going into the girls' bathroom.
Hermione, move!
Help! Help!
Hey, pea brain!
Help!
Do something!
- What?
- Anything!
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.
Wingardium Leviosa.
Cool.
Is it dead?
I don't think so. Just knocked out.
Troll boogers.
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!
- Well, what it is...
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.
Miss Granger?
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.
But I was wrong.
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...
...for your serious lack of judgment.
As for you two gentlemen...
...I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...
...and live to tell the tale.
Five points...
...will be awarded to each of you...
...for sheer dumb luck.
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.
I'm not hungry.
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.
Even if it is against Slytherin.
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...
...so he could get past that dog.
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.
But why would anyone go near that dog?
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.
You're saying...
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.
Let's open it.
It's a broomstick.
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!
But who...?
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.
Woke up in hospital a week later.
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!
The players take their positions...
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!
Now, I want a nice, clean game...
...from all of you!
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!
Well done!
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!
Give me that!
Take that side!
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.
Come on, Hermione!
Lacarnum Inflamarae.
Fire! You're on fire!
Go, go, go, go!
Looks like he's gonna be sick.
He's got the Snitch!
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!
Gryffindor wins!
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard...
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.
Exactly.
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.
What that dog is guarding is
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.
Nicholas Flamel?
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?
I don't know.
Merry Christmas
Ring the Hogwart bell
Merry Christmas
Cast a Christmas spell
Knight to e5.
Queen to e5.
That's totally barbaric!
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.
I see you haven't.
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.
We've looked a hundred times!
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.
What are you wearing?
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.
There they are.
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.
My body's gone!
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!
I'm invisible?
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well".
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?
Who's there?
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.
Who is it? Show yourself.
Severus, I...
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.
We'll have another little chat soon.
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.
Mum?
Dad?
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!
Ron, come on, get out of bed!
- Why?
- There's something you've got to see!
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!
I only see us.
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!
I look good.
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.
Back again, Harry?
I see that you,
like many before you...
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.
I trust by now
you realize what it does.
Let me give you a clue.
The happiest man on earth...
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...
...exactly as he is.
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.
Yes. And no.
It shows us nothing more or less...
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...
...you see them standing beside you.
But remember this, Harry.
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...
...or truth.
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.
And I must ask you...
...not to go looking for it again.
It does not do to dwell on dreams...
...and forget to live.
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.
This is light?
Of course! Here it is!
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.
The what?
Honestly, don't you two read?
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers."
"It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.
I know what it means!
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."
That's what Fluffy's guarding.
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.
Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.
- We think Snape's trying to steal it.
- Are you still on about him?
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.
What?
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers?"
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?
- Spells, enchantments.
- Right.
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's...
I know what that is!
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.
Is that...
...a dragon?
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.
My brother works
with these in Romania.
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.
Hello, Norbert.
- Norbert?
- He's gotta have a name, don't he?
Don't you, Norbert?
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.
Who's that?
Malfoy.
Oh, dear.
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.
- I don't understand. Is that bad?
- It's bad.
Good evening.
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.
- 50?!
- Each.
To ensure it doesn't happen again...
...all four of you
will receive detention.
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.
I thought you said the four of us.
No, you heard me correctly.
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.
You will join your classmates
in detention.
A pity they let
the old punishments die.
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.
God, I miss the screaming.
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?
Norbert's gone.
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.
What if he don't like Romania?
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.
Got to have your wits about you.
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...
...werewolves.
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.
You can be sure of that.
Nighty-night.
Right. Let's go.
Hagrid, what is that?
What we're here for.
See that?
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.
Ron, Hermione, come with me.
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.
Okay. Then I get Fang.
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.
I'm not scared, Potter.
Do you hear that?
Come on, Fang.
Scared!
What is it, Fang?
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.
What was that thing you saved me from?
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.
A cursed life.
- Who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?
The Philosopher's Stone.
Harry!
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.
You all right there, Harry?
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.
You're safe now. Good luck.
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.
Don't you see? We had it wrong.
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.
He'll come back.
But if he comes back...
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.
I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were
frightful, but I found that enjoyable.
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.
- Not like this.
- You should see the nurse.
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.
- Of course!
- What is it?
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...
...and a stranger just happens
to have one?
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?
Why didn't I see it before?
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.
You and this stranger
must have talked.
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.
I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem".
- Was he interested in Fluffy?
- Of course he was interested.
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?
But I told him, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him".
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.
I shouldn't have told you that.
Where are you going?
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!
I'm afraid he's not here.
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.
He's gone?
But this is important!
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!
- How do you know...?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.
- And with Dumbledore gone...
- Good afternoon.
What would three young Gryffindors...
...be doing inside on a day like this?
- We were just...
- You ought to be careful.
People will think you're...
...up to something.
Now what do we do?
We go down the trap door. Tonight.
Trevor.
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?
- Neville, listen. We were...
- No, I won't let you!
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.
Petrificus Totalus.
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?
Brilliant, but scary.
Let's go.
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.
- You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.
Alohomora.
Wait a minute. He's...
...snoring.
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.
It's got horrible breath.
- We have to move its paw.
- What?
Come on!
Okay. Push.
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?
The harp.
It's stopped playing.
Jump!
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!
Hermione!
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.
- We've gotta do something.
- What?
I remember reading something
in Herbology.
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.
Lumus Solem.
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.
Lucky we didn't panic.
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.
What is that?
I don't know. Sounds like wings.
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.
They're not birds.
They're keys.
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.
Strange.
"Alohomora!"
Well, it was worth a try.
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.
What's wrong?
It's too simple.
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.
This complicates things a bit.
Catch the key!
Hurry up!
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.
Where are we? A graveyard.
This is no graveyard.
It's a chessboard.
There's the door.
Now what do we do?
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.
As for me, I'll be a knight.
What happens now?
Well, white moves first.
And then...
...we play.
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...
...real wizard's chess, do you?
You there, d5.
Yes, Hermione.
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.
Castle to e4!
Pawn to c3!
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.
Then you're free to check the king.
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, there must be another way!
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.
Not me. Not Hermione. You.
Knight to h3.
Check.
Ron!
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.
Checkmate.
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.
I have to go on.
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.
Not as good as you.
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.
You?
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the...
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?
Next to him, who would suspect...
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...
...I would have succeeded.
Even with Snape muttering
his countercurse.
Snape was trying to save me?
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.
While everyone ran about,
he went to the third floor to head me off.
He, of course, never trusted me again.
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.
I'm never alone. Never.
Now, what does this mirror do?
I see what I desire.
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?
Use the boy.
Come here, Potter! Now!
Tell me, what do you see?
What is it? What do you see?
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.
He lies.
Tell the truth! What do you see?
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.
I have strength enough for this.
Harry Potter...
...we meet again.
Voldemort.
Yes. You see what I've become?
See what I must do to survive?
Live off another. A mere parasite.
Unicorn blood can sustain me...
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.
But there is something that can.
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.
Stop him!
Don't be a fool.
Why suffer an horrific death...
...when you can join me and live?
Never!
Bravery. Your parents had it too.
Tell me, Harry...
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?
Together...
...we can bring them back.
All I ask is for something in return.
That's it, Harry.
There is no good and evil.
There is only power...
...and those too weak to seek it.
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.
Just give me the Stone!
You liar!
Kill him!
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!
Good afternoon, Harry.
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.
So, naturally, the whole school knows.
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?
Fine. They're both just fine.
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.
The Stone has been destroyed.
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...
...and agreed it was best all around.
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.
But yes, he will die.
How is it I got the Stone, sir?
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and...
You see, only a person...
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.
And between you and me,
that is saying something.
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?
I'm afraid...
...there are ways
in which he can return.
Harry, do you know why...
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.
And that kind of act leaves a mark.
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?
Love, Harry. Love.
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.
But I think I could be safe...
...with a nice toffee.
Alas!
Earwax.
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?
All right. Hermione?
Never better.
Another year gone.
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.
And the points stand thus:
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.
In second place...
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.
And in first place...
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.
Nice one, mate.
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.
However, recent events must
be taken into account.
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...
...while others were in grave peril...
...50 points.
Good job.
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.
And third...
...to Mr. Harry Potter...
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...
...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.
We're tied with Slytherin!
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.
I award 10 points...
...to Neville Longbottom.
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...
...I believe that a change
of decoration is in order.
Gryffindor wins the house cup.
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?
This is for you.
Thanks, Hagrid.
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...
...you could always threaten him...
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?
I'm not going home.
Not really.
I can't let you out, Hedwig.
I'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.
- Besides, if Uncle Vernon...
- Harry Potter!
Now you've done it.
He's in there. Vernon?
I'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.
But she's bored.
If I could only let her out
for an hour or two.
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.
But I haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.
Not one...
...all summer.
Who would want to be
friends with you?
I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...
...even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...
...purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.
Not now.
It's for when the Masons arrive.
Which should be any minute.
Now, let's go over our schedule
once again, shall we?
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be...?
In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.
- Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
- I'll be waiting to open the door.
Excellent.
And you?
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that I don't exist.
Too right, you will.
With any luck, this could be the day
I make the biggest deal of my career...
...and you will not mess it up.
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.
- Who are you?
- Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.
Not to be rude or anything...
...but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.
It's just that Dobby
has come to tell you...
It is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sit down? Sit down?
Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you or anything.
Offend Dobby?
Dobby has heard
of your greatness, sir...
...but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.
You can't have met
many decent wizards then.
No, I haven't.
That was an awful thing to say.
- Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
- Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.
Dobby, please, stop.
Don't mind that. It's just the cat.
- Bad Dobby.
- Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.
Are you all right?
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.
Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.
- Your family?
- The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.
If they ever knew Dobby was here...
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.
Harry Potter must not go back...
...to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?
Can't say.
- Okay, I understand. You can't say.
- Don't make me talk. L...
- Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.
- Bad Dobby.
So when they arrive
at the ninth hole...
Give me the lamp.
Dobby, stop!
- Let me go.
- Get in there and keep quiet.
- What the devil are you doing up here?
- I was just...
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.
Sorry.
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.
- And fix that door.
- Yes, sir.
See why I've got to go back?
I don't belong here.
I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.
- It's the only place I've got friends.
- Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?
Well, I expect they've been...
Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?
Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him...
...Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.
- Give me those. Now.
- No!
Dobby, get back here.
Dobby, please, no.
Harry Potter must say
he's not going back to school.
I can't. Hogwarts is my home.
Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter's own good.
It spread as far as the eye could see,
all over the floor of this building.
One plumber said,
"Look at all that water."
The second plumber said,
"Yes, and that's just the top of it."
I'm so sorry. It's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why I kept him upstairs.
You're never going back to that school.
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!
Hiya, Harry.
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.
You better stand back.
Let's go.
- What was that?
- What was it?
Potter!
Dad, what's going on?
Go. Go. Go.
Dad, hurry up.
- Come on.
- Come on, Harry, hurry up.
Petunia, he's escaping!
- I've got you, Harry.
- Come here!
- Let go of me!
- No, boy!
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.
- Get off!
- Drive!
- Right.
- Right!
No! No! No! No!
Dad!
Damn.
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.
Come on.
Okay, come on.
Okay, come on.
- Think it'd be all right if we had some?
- Yeah, Mum will never know.
It's not much, but it's home.
I think it's brilliant.
Where have you been?
Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.
You could have died.
You could have been seen.
Of course, I don't
blame you, Harry, dear.
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.
Well, you best hope I don't put bars
on your window, Ronald Weasley.
Come on, Harry,
time for a spot of breakfast.
Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.
That's it. There we go.
- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
- Yes, dear, it was on the cat.
Hello.
What did I do?
Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.
- Morning, Weasleys.
- Morning, Dad.
- What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
- Raids?
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.
Dad loves Muggles,
thinks they're fascinating.
Well, now.
And who are you?
Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.
Good Lord. Are you really?
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?
This morning.
Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.
Did you really? How did it go?
I mean... That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.
Tell me, what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?
- Errol.
- He's always doing that.
Look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.
- No.
- This lot won't come cheap.
- The spell books alone are expensive.
- We'll manage.
There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.
Right.
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.
Floo powder?
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.
In you go.
That's it.
Diagon Alley.
You see? It's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.
Come on.
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.
That's it, very good.
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.
Diagonally.
- What did he say, dear?
- Diagonally.
I thought he did.
- Not lost, are you, my dear?
- I'm fine, thank you. I was just going...
Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.
- No. Please...
- Harry?
Hagrid!
What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around
Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.
I was lost, l...
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?
Me? I was... I was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
They're ruining all the school cabbages.
Harry. Hagrid.
Hello, Hermione.
- It's so good to see you.
- It's great to see you too.
What did you do to your glasses?
Oculus Reparo.
I definitely need to remember that one.
You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.
- Okay, bye.
- Thank you. Bye.
Come on, everyone's been so worried.
Harry.
Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.
Here he is.
Mum fancies him.
Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.
Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the Daily Prophet.
It can't be. Harry Potter?
Harry Potter!
Excuse me, madam.
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and I rate the front page.
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...
...to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me...
...which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...
...its 27th week atop
the Daily Prophet bestseller list...
...he had no idea that he would,
in fact, be leaving...
...with my entire collected works...
...free of charge.
Now, ladies?
Harry, now you give me those,
and I'll get them signed.
All of you wait outside.
That's it.
I'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?
Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a
bookshop without making the front page.
Leave him alone.
Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.
Mr. Potter.
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.
Forgive me.
Your scar is legend.
As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.
Voldemort killed my parents.
He was nothing more than a murderer.
You must be very brave
to mention his name.
Or very foolish.
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.
And you must be Miss Granger.
Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.
Muggles, aren't they?
Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions...
...tatty, secondhand book.
You must be the Weasleys.
It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.
- Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
- Lucius.
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?
I do hope they're paying you overtime...
...but judging by the state of this,
I'd say not.
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...
...if they don't even pay you well for it?
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.
Clearly.
Associating with Muggles.
And I thought your family
could sink no lower.
I'll see you at work.
See you at school.
- 10:58, come on.
- The train will be leaving any moment.
Fred, George, Percy, you first.
Okay.
After you, dear.
Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.
Let's go.
- What do you two think you're doing?
- Sorry.
Lost control of the trolley.
- Why can't we get through?
- I don't know.
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.
The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
We've missed it.
Harry, if we can't get through...
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.
The car.
Ron, I should tell you...
...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.
Right.
Okay.
Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster
must be faulty.
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.
Okay.
All we need to do is catch up
with the train.
We can't be far behind.
- Do you hear that?
- We must be getting close.
Hold on.
Harry!
Hold on!
Take my hand!
Hold on!
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.
- I think we found the train.
- Yeah.
Welcome home.
Up! Up!
It's not working!
Up! Ron, mind that tree!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
- My wand. Look at my wand.
- Be thankful it's not your neck.
- What's happening?
- I don't know.
Come on, go! Fast!
Scabbers, you're okay.
The car!
Dad's gonna kill me.
See you, Hedwig.
So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom...
...we can't get through the barrier
to platform 93/4...
...we almost get killed by a tree...
Clearly someone doesn't want me
here this year.
Well, take a good look, lads.
This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.
You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?
You have risked
the exposure of our world.
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...
...that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.
Honestly, Professor Snape,
I think it did more damage to us.
Silence.
I assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me...
...the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.
- As it is...
- They are not.
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.
Headmaster...
...these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.
- As such...
- I am well aware of our bylaws...
...having written
quite a few of them myself.
However, as head of Gryffindor house...
...it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.
We'll go and get our stuff, then.
What are you
talking about, Mr. Weasley?
You're going to expel us, aren't you?
Not today, Mr. Weasley...
...but I must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.
I will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.
Morning, everyone.
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Professor Sprout.
Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?
Yes, Miss Granger?
Mandrake, or Mandragora...
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.
It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...
...their cries won't kill you yet.
But they could knock you out for hours,
which is why I have given you earmuffs...
...for auditory protection.
So could you please put them on,
right away? Quickly.
Flaps tight down,
and watch me closely.
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.
Got it? And...
...now you dunk it down
into the other pot...
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.
Longbottom's been neglecting
his earmuffs.
- No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
- Yes, well, just leave him there.
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.
- There's Nearly Headless Nick.
- Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Say it. I'm doomed.
- You're doomed.
- Hi, Harry.
I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.
Ron, is that your owl?
Bloody bird's a menace.
Oh, no.
Look, everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.
Go on, Ron. I ignored one
from my gran once. It was horrible.
Ronald Weasley!
How dare you steal that car!
I am absolutely disgusted!
Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...
... and it's entirely your fault!
If you put another toe out of line...
... we'll bring you straight home!
And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.
Your father and I are so proud.
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Me.
Gilderoy Lockhart...
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...
...honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...
...and five times winner...
...of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.
But I don't talk about that.
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.
Now, be warned.
It is my job to arm you...
...against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst I am here.
I must ask you not to scream.
It might provoke them.
Cornish pixies?
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...
...but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.
Let's see what you make of them.
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.
- You just stay there!
- Please, get me down!
- Get off me!
- Stop. Hold still!
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!
I'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.
What do we do now?
Immobulus!
Why is it always me?
I spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.
What...? I don't believe it.
- Where you think you're going, Flint?
- Quidditch practice.
- I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
- Easy, Wood. I've got a note.
I smell trouble.
"I, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...
...permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker."
You've got a new Seeker. Who?
- Malfoy?
- That's right.
And that's not all
that's new this year.
Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
How did you get those?
A gift from Draco's father.
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.
They got in on pure talent.
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!
You okay, Ron?
Say something.
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
- No, Colin, get out of the way.
Let's take him to Hagrid's.
He'll know what to do.
This calls for
a specialist's equipment.
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
I'm afraid.
- Okay.
- Better out than in.
- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
- Malfoy. He called Hermione...
Well, I don't know
exactly what it means.
He called me a Mudblood.
- He did not.
- What's a Mudblood?
It means "dirty blood." Mudblood's a foul
name for someone who's Muggle-born.
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.
It's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.
That's horrible.
It's disgusting.
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.
Come here.
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.
Harry, Harry, Harry.
Can you possibly imagine...
...a better way to serve detention...
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?
Not really.
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.
Remember that.
Come.
Come...
... to me.
- What?
- Sorry?
That voice.
Voice?
- Didn't you hear it?
- What are you talking about, Harry?
I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.
Spooky.
Blood.
I smell blood.
Let me rip you.
Let me kill you.
Kill!
Kill!
- Kill!
- Harry!
- Did you hear it?
- Hear what?
- That voice.
- Voice? What voice?
I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just...
It's time.
It's moving.
I think it's going to kill.
- Kill?
- Harry, wait! Not so fast!
Strange.
- I've never seen spiders act like that.
- I don't like spiders.
What's that?
"The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware."
It's written in blood.
Oh, no.
It's Filch's cat.
It's Mrs. Norris.
"Enemies of the Heir, beware."
You'll be next, Mudbloods.
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.
Potter?
What are you...?
Mrs. Norris?
- You've murdered my cat.
- No. No.
I'll kill you.
- I'll kill you!
- Argus!
Argus, I...
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.
Everyone except...
...you three.
Ravenclaws, follow me.
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.
Thought so.
So unlucky I wasn't there.
I know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.
But how she has been Petrified,
I cannot say.
Ask him.
It's him that's done it.
You saw what he wrote on the wall.
It's not true, sir. I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.
- Rubbish.
- Lf I might, headmaster?
Perhaps Potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.
However...
...the circumstances are suspicious.
I, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.
That's why Ron and I
went looking for him, professor.
We'd just found him when he said...
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- When I said I wasn't hungry.
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.
- Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
- My cat has been Petrified.
- I want to see some punishment!
- We will be able to cure her, Argus.
As I understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.
And in the meantime...
...I strongly recommend caution...
...to all.
- It's a bit strange, isn't it?
- Strange?
You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?
Are you mad?
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.
She's right, you know.
Could I have your attention,
please?
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...
...into water goblets.
Like so.
One, two, three.
Vera Verto.
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?
Mr. Weasley.
"One, two, three. Vera Verto."
Vera Verto!
That wand needs replacing,
Mr. Weasley.
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- Professor...
...I was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.
Very well.
You all know, of course...
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.
- One did not.
- Three guesses who.
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...
...about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.
In other words, pure-bloods.
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.
Now, according to legend...
...Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...
...until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.
The Heir alone...
...would be able to open the Chamber...
...and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...
...purge the school
of all those who...
...in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.
Muggle-borns.
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.
No such chamber has been found.
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...
...that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.
It is said to be the home...
...of a monster.
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it has been opened, that means...
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
- Lf you're talking about Malfoy...
- Of course. You heard him.
"You'll be next, Mudbloods."
I heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.
Mind you, it would be difficult.
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.
Here it is.
The Polyjuice Potion.
"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion
allows the drinker...
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another."
You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?
- Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
- Exactly.
But it's tricky. I've never seen
a more complicated potion.
- How long will it take to make?
- A month.
A month?
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...
...he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.
I know.
But it's the only plan we've got.
Another goal for Slytherin!
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.
Yeah!
Yeah!
All right there, Scarhead?
Watch yourself, Harry!
Wood, look out!
Blimey! Harry's got himself
a rogue Bludger.
That's been tampered with, that has.
I'll stop it.
No! Even with a proper wand,
it's too risky. You could hit Harry.
Training for the ballet, Potter?
You'll never catch me, Potter.
Let's go.
Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.
Gryffindor wins!
Finite Incantatem!
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?
No. I think my arm is broken.
Not to worry, Harry. I will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.
- Not you.
- Boy doesn't know what he's saying.
This won't hurt a bit.
Brackium Emendo!
Yes, well,
that can sometimes happen...
...but the point is...
...you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.
Broken? There's no bones left.
Much more flexible, though.
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.
Should have been brought
straight to me.
I can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back...
You will be able to, won't you?
I'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?
Kill.
Kill.
Time to kill.
Hello.
Dobby?
Harry Potter should have listened
to Dobby.
Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.
It was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.
Indeed. Yes, sir.
- You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
- At least you would be away from here.
Harry Potter must go home.
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see...
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.
Dobby had to iron his hands.
You better clear off before my bones
come back, or I might strangle you.
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.
Dobby gets them five times a day
at home.
I don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?
Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed...
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.
Of course, Dobby is still
treated like vermin.
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?
This, sir? It is a mark
of the house-elf's enslavement.
Dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.
Listen.
Listen!
Terrible things are
about to happen at Hogwarts.
Harry Potter must not stay here...
...now that history
is to repeat itself.
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?
I shouldn't have said that.
- Bad Dobby! Bad!
- Stop it!
Stop it, Dobby!
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby
only wants Harry Potter to be safe.
No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?
Put him here.
- What happened?
- There's been another attack.
I think he's been Petrified,
Madam Pomfrey.
Look. Perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker.
What can this mean, Albus?
It means...
...that our students
are in great danger.
- What should I tell the staff?
- The truth.
Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer safe.
It is as we feared, Minerva.
The Chamber of Secrets
has indeed been opened again.
Again? You mean the Chamber
of Secrets has been opened before?
Of course.
Don't you see?
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here.
- Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
- Maybe.
We'll have to wait for
the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight...
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?
No. No one ever comes in here.
- Why?
- Moaning Myrtle.
Who?
Moaning Myrtle.
- Who's Moaning Myrtle?
- I'm Moaning Myrtle.
I wouldn't expect you to know me.
Who would ever talk
about ugly, miserable...
...moping Moaning Myrtle?
She's a little sensitive.
Gather round!
Gather round.
Can everybody see me?
Can you all hear me?
Excellent.
In light of the dark events
of recent weeks...
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club...
...to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves...
...as I myself have done
on countless occasions.
For full details,
see my published works.
Let me introduce my assistant...
...Professor Snape.
He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.
I don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.
You'll still have your Potions master
when I'm through with him. Never fear.
One.
Two.
- Three!
- Expelliarmus!
- Do you think he's all right?
- Who cares?
An excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape...
...but if you don't mind me saying, it was
obvious what you were about to do.
If I had wanted to stop you,
it would have been only too easy.
Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students...
...to block unfriendly spells,
professor.
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?
Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells.
We'll be sending Potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox.
Might I suggest someone
from my own house?
Malfoy, perhaps?
- Good luck, Potter.
- Thank you, sir.
Wands at the ready.
- Scared, Potter?
- You wish.
On the count of three...
...cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.
We don't want any accidents here.
One.
- Two.
- Everte Statum!
Rictusempra!
I said disarm only.
Serpensortia!
Don't move, Potter.
I'll get rid of it for you.
Allow me, Professor Snape.
Alarte Ascendare!
Vipera Evanesca.
What are you playing at?
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?
- I'm a what?
- You can talk to snakes.
I know. I accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.
Once. But so what?
I bet loads of people here can do it.
No, they can't.
It's not a very common gift, Harry.
This is bad.
What's bad? If I hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin...
- That's what you said to it.
- You were there. You heard me.
I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.
I spoke a different language?
But I didn't realize...
How can I speak a language
without knowing I can?
I don't know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.
Harry, listen to me.
There's a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.
Exactly.
Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.
But I'm not.
I can't be.
He lived a thousand years ago.
For all we know, you could be.
I'll see you back in the common room.
I want blood.
They all must die.
Kill.
Kill.
Kill.
Time to kill.
Caught in the act.
I'll have you out this time, Potter.
Mark my words.
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand...
Professor...
...I swear I didn't.
This is out of my hands, Potter.
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.
Sherbet Lemon.
Professor Dumbledore?
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?
I was just wondering
if you put me in the right house.
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.
But I stand by what I said last year.
You would have done well in Slytherin.
You're wrong.
Harry?
Professor.
Your bird...
There was nothing I could do.
- He just caught fire.
- And about time too.
He's been looking dreadful for days.
Pity you had to see him
on a burning day.
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.
They burst into flame
when it is time for them to die...
...and then they are...
...reborn from the ashes.
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.
They can carry immensely heavy loads.
Their tears have healing powers.
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!
Professor Dumbledore, sir,
it wasn't Harry.
I'd be prepared to swear it
in front of the Ministry of Magic.
Relax.
I do not believe...
...that Harry attacked anyone.
- Of course you don't.
Right. Well, I'll...
- I'll just wait outside, then.
- Yes.
- You don't think it was me, professor?
- No, Harry.
I do not think it was you.
But I must ask you...
...is there something
you wish to tell me?
No, sir.
Nothing.
Very well, then.
Off you go.
Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.
Crabbe and Goyle.
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...
...can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.
- How?
- I've got it all worked out.
I filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.
Simple, but powerful.
Now, once they're asleep...
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...
...and put on their uniforms.
- Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
- I've already got mine.
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.
I got this off her robes.
I'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle
find these.
Ron, maybe I should do it.
Yeah. Right.
Wingardium Leviosa.
Cool.
How thick could you get?
Come on, let's get them.
We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.
Add the hairs.
Essence of Crabbe.
Cheers.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Me too.
Harry?
Ron.
Bloody hell!
We still sound like ourselves.
You need to sound more like Crabbe.
- Bloody hell.
- Excellent.
- But where's Hermione?
- I...
I don't think I'm going.
You go on without me.
Hermione, are you okay?
Just go. You're wasting time.
Come on.
I think the Slytherin common room's
this way.
Excuse me.
What are you doing d...?
I mean, what are you doing down here?
I happen to be a school prefect.
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.
What are your names again?
- I'm...
- Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?
Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?
Why are you wearing glasses?
- Reading.
- Reading?
I didn't know you could read.
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.
Well, sit down.
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?
Stomachache.
I'm surprised the Daily Prophet
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.
I suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...
...that ever happened to this place.
- You're wrong!
What?
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?
Well? Do you?
Harry Potter?
Good one, Goyle.
You're absolutely right.
Saint Potter.
And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.
You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.
How many times do I have to tell you?
Is this yours?
But my father did say this:
It's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.
As for me...
...I hope it's Granger.
What's the matter with you two?
You're acting very odd.
It's his stomachache.
Calm down.
Scar.
Hair.
Hey! Where are you going?
That was close.
Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.
Go away.
Wait till you see. It's awful.
Hermione?
Are you okay?
Do you remember me telling you...
...that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?
It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.
Look at my face.
Look at your tail.
Have you spoken to Hermione?
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.
What's this?
Yuck!
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.
- Come to throw something else at me?
- Why would I throw something at you?
Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business...
...and someone thinks it's funny
to throw a book at me.
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.
I mean, it'll just go
right through you.
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.
Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!
Fifty points if it goes through her head!
- But who threw it at you, anyway?
- I don't know. I didn't see them.
I was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death...
...and it fell through the top
of my head.
"Tom Marvolo Riddle."
My name...
...is Harry...
...Potter.
Do you know anything...
...about the Chamber of Secrets?
Can you...
...tell me?
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what's going on here?
Are you Tom Riddle?
Hello, can you hear me?
Riddle!
Come.
Professor Dumbledore.
Dumbledore?
It is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour, Tom.
Yes, professor. I suppose I...
I had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.
I'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.
About the school as well?
I don't have a home to go to.
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, professor?
I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid...
...Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.
Sir, if it all stopped,
if the person responsible was caught...
Is there something...
...you wish to tell me?
No, sir. Nothing.
Very well, then. Off you go.
Good night, sir.
- Let's get you out of there.
- Evening, Hagrid.
I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't
think you meant it to kill anyone...
You can't. You don't understand.
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...
...is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.
It wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.
- Now, stand aside.
- No!
- Stand aside, Hagrid.
- No!
Cistem Aperio!
Arania Exumai!
Aragog!
Aragog!
I can't let you go.
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.
Hagrid!
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.
It can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?
That would be a cheerful visit.
"Hello, Hagrid.
Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me, now, would you?
No.
What's that you've got, Hagrid?
It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing to do.
But once their acne's cleared up,
we'll chop them up and stew them...
...and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.
In the meantime, though, you three...
...had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?
Hello, Neville.
Harry, I don't know who did it,
but you'd better come.
Come on!
It had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.
Unless it wasn't a student.
Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.
And they found it.
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
All right, listen up.
We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.
Not to mention they're dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them...
...if they fly anywhere near him.
- Well, that too.
Professor McGonagall.
- This match has been canceled.
- We can't cancel Quidditch.
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.
Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley.
There's something
the both of you have to see.
I warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.
Hermione!
She was found near the library...
...along with this.
Does it mean anything to either of you?
No.
Could I have your attention, please?
Because of recent events, these new
rules will be put into effect immediately:
"All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.
No exceptions."
I should tell you this:
Unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught...
...it is likely the school will be closed.
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
I can't believe it's him...
...but if he did set the monster loose
last time...
...he'll know how to get inside
the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.
But you heard McGonagall.
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.
I think it's time to get
my dad's old cloak out again.
Who's there?
Hello?
Hello?
- What's that for?
- Nothing. I was expecting...
It doesn't matter. Come on in.
I just made a pot of tea.
Hagrid, are you okay?
I'm fine. I'm all right.
Did you hear about Hermione?
Yeah. I heard about that, all right.
Look, we have to ask you something.
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?
What you had to understand
about that is...
Quick, under the cloak.
Don't say a word.
Be quiet, both of you.
- Professor Dumbledore, sir.
- Good evening, Hagrid.
I wonder, could we...?
Of course. Come in. Come in.
That's Dad's boss.
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Had to come.
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.
- The Ministry's got to act.
- But I never...
You know I never, professor.
I want it understood, Cornelius...
...that Hagrid...
...has my full confidence.
Albus, look,
Hagrid's record is against him.
- I've got to take him.
- Take me?
Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.
I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.
Already here, Fudge?
Good.
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!
Believe me...
...I take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your...
You call this a house?
No.
I simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here.
Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?
The other governors and I have decided
it's time for you to step aside.
This is an order of suspension.
You'll find all 12 signatures on it.
I'm afraid we feel
you've rather lost your touch.
Well, what, with all these attacks...
...there'll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.
I can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school.
You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.
Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.
You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!
You think so?
Calm yourself, Hagrid.
If the governors desire my removal...
...I will, of course, step aside.
However...
...you will find that help
will always be given at Hogwarts...
...to those who...
...ask for it.
Admirable sentiments.
Shall we?
Fudge.
Come, Hagrid.
Well?
Lf...
If anybody was looking for some stuff...
...then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.
Yep. That would lead them right.
That's all I have to say.
And someone will need
to feed Fang while I'm away.
Good boy.
Hagrid's right.
With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.
Look.
Come on.
Come on, Fang.
Come on.
What?
You heard what Hagrid said.
"Follow the spiders."
They're heading to the Dark Forest.
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
"follow the butterflies"?
Harry, I don't like this.
- Harry, I don't like this at all.
- Shush!
Can we go back now?
Come on.
Who is it?
Don't panic.
Hagrid?
Is that you?
We're friends of Hagrid's.
And you?
You're Aragog, aren't you?
Yes.
Hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before.
He's in trouble. Up at the school,
there have been attacks.
They think it's Hagrid.
They think he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.
That's a lie.
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.
- Then you're not the monster?
- No.
The monster was born in the castle.
I came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler.
Harry.
But if you're not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?
We do not speak of it.
It is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.
But have you seen it?
I never saw any part of the castle
but the box in which Hagrid kept me.
The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.
When I was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.
- Harry!
- What?
Well, thank you.
We'll just go.
Go?
I think not.
My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my command.
But I cannot deny them
fresh meat...
...when it wanders
so willingly into our midst.
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.
Can we panic now?
Know any spells?
One, but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.
Where's Hermione when you need her?
Let's go!
Arania Exumai!
Go!
Glad we're out of there.
Arania Exumai!
- Thanks for that.
- Don't mention it.
Get us out of here.
Now!
Come on!
Come on, move faster!
Come on! Go!
Get us in the air.
The flying gear's jammed!
- Come on! Pull!
- I'm trying!
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.
If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
I'll kill him.
I mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?
- What have we found out?
- We know one thing.
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.
He was innocent.
Wish you were here, Hermione.
We need you.
Now more than ever.
- What's that?
- Ron...
This is why Hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked.
Come on.
"Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land...
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...
...instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.
Spiders flee before it."
Ron, this is it.
The monster in the Chamber
of Secrets is a basilisk.
That's why I can hear it speak.
It's a snake.
But if it kills by looking people
in the eye, why is it no one's dead?
Because no one did look it
in the eye.
Not directly, at least.
Colin saw it through his camera.
Justin... Justin must have seen the
basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.
Nick got the full blast of it.
But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.
And Hermione had the mirror.
I bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.
And Mrs. Norris?
I'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.
The water.
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.
"Spiders flee before it."
- It all fits.
- How's a basilisk been getting around?
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.
- Hermione's answered that too.
- Pipes? It's using the plumbing.
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?
Moaning Myrtle.
All students are to return
to their house dormitories at once.
All teachers to the second-floor
corridor immediately.
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin
has left another message.
Our worst fear has been realized.
A student has been taken by the monster
into the Chamber itself.
The students must be sent home.
I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have I missed?
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.
- My moment?
- Weren't you saying just last night...
...that you've known all along where the
entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.
- Your skills, after all, are legend.
- Very well.
I'll just be in my office getting...
Getting ready.
Who is it that the monster's taken,
Minerva?
Ginny Weasley.
"Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever."
Ginny.
Lockhart may be useless, but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber.
At least we can tell him
what we know.
Professor, we have some information
for you.
Are you going somewhere?
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.
- What about my sister?
- Well...
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than I.
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.
I must say, when I took the job,
there was nothing in the description...
You're running away?
- After all you did in your books?
- Books can be misleading.
- You wrote them.
- My dear boy, use your common sense.
My books wouldn't have sold as well if
people didn't think I'd done those things.
You're a fraud.
You've been taking credit
for what other wizards have done.
Is there anything you can do?
Yes, now you mention it.
I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.
Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.
I'd never have sold another book.
In fact, I'm going to have to do
the same to you.
Don't even think about it.
Who's there?
Hello, Harry.
- What do you want?
- To ask you how you died.
It was dreadful.
It happened right here
in this very cubicle.
I'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.
I was crying, and then
I heard somebody come in.
- Who was it, Myrtle?
- I don't know. I was distraught!
But they said something funny,
a kind of made-up language.
And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and...
...I died.
- Just like that? How?
I just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes...
...over there by that sink.
This is it.
This is it, Ron. I think this is
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.
Say something. Harry,
say something in Parseltongue.
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, I'll just be...
There's no need for me to stay.
Yes, there is.
- You first.
- Now, boys, what good will it do?
Better you than us.
But... Obviously, yes.
Sure you don't want to test it first?
It's really quite filthy down here.
- All right. Let's go.
- Oh, Harry?
If you die down there,
you're welcome to share my toilet.
Thanks, Myrtle.
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.
Go on.
This way.
- What's this?
- It looks like a snake.
- It's a snakeskin.
- Bloody hell.
Whatever shed this must be
Heart of a lion, this one.
The adventure ends here, boys.
But don't fret.
The world will know our story.
How I was too late to save the girl.
How you two
tragically lost your minds...
...at the sight of her mangled body.
So...
You first, Mr. Potter.
Say goodbye to your memories.
Obliviate!
- Ron! Ron, are you okay?
- I'm fine.
Hello.
Who are you?
- Ron Weasley.
- Really?
And who am I?
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.
It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?
Do you live here?
- No.
- Really?
- What do I do now?
- You wait here...
...and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through.
- I'll go on and find Ginny.
- Okay.
Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up, wake up.
Please wake up.
She won't wake.
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won't wake?
- She's not...?
- She's still alive, but only just.
- Are you a ghost?
- A memory...
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.
She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.
You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.
It won't come until it's called.
- Give me my wand, Tom.
- You won't be needing it.
- We've got to go. We've got to save her.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,
I grow stronger.
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.
It was Ginny who set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...
...Ginny who wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.
- But why?
- Because I told her to.
You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.
She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her.
She tried to dispose of it
in the girls' bathroom.
And then who should find it but you?
The very person
I was most anxious to meet.
And why did you want to meet me?
I knew I had to talk to you,
meet you if I could.
So I decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid...
...to gain your trust.
- Hagrid's my friend.
- And you framed him, didn't you?
- It was my word against Hagrid's.
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.
I'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.
He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while I was at school...
...so I decided to leave behind
a diary...
...preserving my 16-year-old self
in its pages...
...so that one day
I would be able to lead another...
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's
noble work.
Well, you haven't finished it
this time.
In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught
will be ready.
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.
For many months now,
my new target has been you.
How is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent...
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time?
How did you escape with nothing
but a scar...
...while Lord Voldemort's powers
were destroyed?
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.
- You're Voldemort.
- Surely you didn't think...
...I was going to keep
my filthy Muggle father's name?
No. I fashioned myself a new name,
a name I knew wizards everywhere...
...would fear to speak when I became
the greatest sorcerer in the world.
Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world.
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.
He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.
Fawkes?
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.
A songbird and an old hat.
Let's match the power of Lord
Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin...
...against the famous Harry Potter.
Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. It only obeys me.
No!
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,
but it can still hear you.
Yes, Potter.
The process is nearly complete.
In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and I will cease to be a memory.
Lord Voldemort will return...
...very much alive.
Ginny?
Remarkable, isn't it...
...how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body?
I'd guess you have little more
than a minute to live.
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.
Funny, the damage a silly
little book can do...
...especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.
What are you doing?
Stop. No!
It was me.
But I swear, I didn't mean to.
Riddle made me, and...
Harry, you're hurt.
Don't worry.
Ginny, you need
to get yourself out.
Follow the Chamber
and you'll find Ron.
You were brilliant, Fawkes.
I just wasn't quick enough.
Of course.
Phoenix tears have healing powers.
Thanks.
It's all right, Ginny.
It's over.
It's just a memory.
Amazing!
This is just like magic!
You both realize, of course...
...that in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.
Yes, sir.
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.
Yes, sir.
Therefore, it is only fitting...
...that you both receive...
...Special Awards for Services
to the School.
Thanks, sir.
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...
...have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.
I believe we want
our gamekeeper back.
First, I want to thank you, Harry.
You must have shown me
real loyalty down in the Chamber.
Nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you.
And...
...second...
...I sense that something
is troubling you.
Am I right, Harry?
It's just...
You see, sir, I couldn't help
but notice certain things, certain...
Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.
I see.
Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.
If I'm not mistaken, Harry...
...he transferred
some of his powers to you...
...the night he gave you that scar.
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?
Not intentionally...
...but yes.
So the Sorting Hat was right.
I should be in Slytherin.
It's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.
Determination, resourcefulness...
...and if I may say so,
a certain disregard for the rules.
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat
place you in Gryffindor?
- Because I asked it to.
- Exactly, Harry. Exactly.
Which makes you different
from Voldemort.
It is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.
It is our choices.
If you want proof
why you belong in Gryffindor...
...then I suggest
you look more closely at this.
Be careful.
Godric Gryffindor.
It would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.
Dobby.
So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.
I'll deal with you later.
Out of my way, Potter.
So it's true. You have returned.
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...
...was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.
- Ridiculous.
- Curiously, Lucius, several of them...
...were under the impression
that you would curse their family...
...if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place.
- How dare you!
- Beg your pardon?
My sole concern has always been
and will always be...
...the welfare of this school...
...and, of course, its students.
The culprit has been identified,
I presume?
Yes.
And?
Who was it?
Voldemort.
Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else...
...by means of this.
I see.
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
discovered it.
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...
...should find their way
into innocent hands.
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...
...severe.
Well, let us hope...
...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.
Don't worry. I will be.
Dumbledore.
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.
Sir?
I wonder if I could have that?
Mr. Malfoy.
Mr. Malfoy!
I have something of yours.
Mine? I don't know
what you're talking about.
I think you do, sir.
I think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...
...that day at Diagon Alley.
You do, do you?
Why don't you prove it?
Come, Dobby.
Open it.
Dobby.
Master has given Dobby a sock.
What? I didn't give...
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.
Dobby is free.
You lost me my servant!
You shall not harm Harry Potter.
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...
...you are going to meet
the same sticky end.
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?
- Just promise me something.
- Anything, sir.
Never try to save my life again.
- Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.
- Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
- Good evening.
- Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.
Hello.
- Hermione! Welcome back.
- Thanks, Sir Nicholas.
Harry. It's Hermione.
- Welcome back, Hermione.
- It's good to be back.
Congratulations.
I can't believe you solved it.
We had loads of help from you.
- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Thanks.
Could I have your attention, please?
Before we begin the feast...
...let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...
...whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...
...to all who had been Petrified.
Also, in light of the recent events...
...as a school treat...
...all exams have been canceled.
Oh, no.
Sorry I'm late.
The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.
Some ruddy bird called Errol.
And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry and Ron...
...and Hermione, of course...
...I would still be you-know-where...
...so I'd just like to say thanks.
There's no Hogwarts
without you, Hagrid.
Year One. On his 11 th birthday...
... Harry Potter discovered a secret that
changed the course of his life forever.
- You're a wizard, Harry.
- I'm a what?
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
- I'm Ron, by the way.
- I'm Hermione Granger.
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Potter.
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.
The first years, please note that the
Dark Forest is strictly forbidden.
Also, the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.
Troll in the dungeon!
Hermione, move!
Thought you ought to know.
Quick, let's hide through that door!
It's locked!
- We're done for!
- Move over! Alohomora.
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.
Understand this, Harry:
Not all wizards are good.
Mr. Potter. Our new celebrity.
But you are a Seeker.
And the game begins.
Someone's going to try and steal
the Philosopher's Stone.
Petrificus Totalus.
You're a great wizard. You really are.
Ron!
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry. Harry.
Harry, open the door.
Marge. How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing. School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more. That's a boy.
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?
St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up! Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon! Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening."
What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then. In.
No, no, no. I'll get this.
You get in.
Come on.
Come on. Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight...
...seven, six, five...
...four, three, three and a half...
...two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of...
...You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys? Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that...
...and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...
...for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...
...was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...
...wander.
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes? All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.
But I think that you need
to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who...
...Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.
And in his mind...
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.
And that is why...
...he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...
...you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley...
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick. Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on. Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...
...to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...
...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell! What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this. It'll help.
It's all right. It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.
Eat. You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.
And did either of you two...
...you know...
...pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words...
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter. Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher...
...has decided to retire...
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...
...that his place will be taken
by none other...
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note...
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured...
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...
...a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...
...to give them no reason
to harm you.
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know,
happiness can be found...
...even in the darkest of times...
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no. Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green. That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him. His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden
your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.
So...
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear...
...you have the Grim.
The Grin? What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.
It's an omen...
...of death."
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on. That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.
You have to be in two
classes at once.
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson. So follow me.
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor! Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Come on now.
Now...
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...
...step up. Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not... Well,
we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry. Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.
Go on. Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry. That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa! Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown? That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...
...as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me. Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.
Come on.
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No...
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes. Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...
...and turn it into something funny.
Next! Ron!
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see? Very good, very good!
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve. Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next! Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it,
then I could...
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys. See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night
on the train...
...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted...
...I heard something.
A woman...
...screaming.
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother...
...the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes. I knew her.
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James,
on the other hand...
...he...
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain. I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady! She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard. Move!
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going! Slow down!
You listen! I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...
...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall...
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...
...about your appointment
of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced
the castle is safe...
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon...
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...
...on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf"...
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...
...being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really? I meant the match. Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you,
he sent them off.
There's something else
you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one
on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- Lf you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs...
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."
We owe them so much.
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways...
...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well. Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new
dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...
...into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death...
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters...
...and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...
...but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...
...and remains to this day...
...Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend...
...and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are. You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No? Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...
...it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we? Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto... Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt...
...but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry. Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry...
...I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that...
...is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...
...talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn 't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed. Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.
If you don't mind, I would appreciate
it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and..."
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business."
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well. Lupin.
Out for a little walk
in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.
Are you deaf? Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...
...but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...
...is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really? And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see. Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...
...to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...
...but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...
...shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt...
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say? Father said...
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me
when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers! You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey. What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister. Over this way.
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick. Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.
- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me. Scabbers.
Ron. Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good. Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!
No. Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- It's him.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!
And all this time,
you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well. Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents...
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room! Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You've put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have business...
...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that,
the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No. Don't worry, okay?
It's fine. I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.
That was a noble thing
you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...
...to become killers.
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry...
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...
...but if you ever wanted
a different home...
What? Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus! Remus!
Run! Run!
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No. Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true. Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice,
however honest and true...
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful...
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight...
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell
was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
Come on. And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione! Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come. I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door. Go!
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry. Go!
Get away. Get off.
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister. Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well.
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look. It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...
...I did see someone.
That someone
made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him...
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead. I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country...
...someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.
Sirius. Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there. You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying...
...both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it
this time because...
...well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this...
...to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.
And besides...
...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this...
...but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us
never really leave us.
And you can always find them...
...in here.
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No. I resigned, actually.
Resigned? Why?
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already...
...risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything...
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then...
...mischief managed.
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Nox.
Bloody kids.
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.
As l recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.
l only meant. . .
. . .perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.
No! The boy is everything!
lt cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.
Exactly as l said.
-l will not disappoint you, my Lord.
-Good.
First, gather our old comrades.
Send them a sign.
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker. . .
. . .is standing just outside the door.
Step aside, Wormtail,
so l can give our guest a proper greeting.
Avada Kedavra!
Harry.
Harry!
Are you all right?
Hermione. Bad dream.
-When did you get here?
-Just now. You?
Last night.
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!
Bloody hell.
Honestly, get dressed.
And don't go back to sleep.
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!
-Ron, where are we actually going?
-Don't know.
-Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
-Haven't the foggiest.
Keep up!
Arthur!
lt's about time, son.
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am l right?
Yes, sir.
This way.
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.
-Yes, sir.
-Great, great pleasure.
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.
Yes, it's just over there.
-Shall we?
-Oh, yeah.
We don't want to be late.
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?
-That isn't just any manky old boot.
-lt's a Portkey.
Time to go!
What's a Portkey?
-Ready! After three. One, two. . .
-Harry!
. . .three!
Let go, kids!
-What?!
-Let go!
l'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?
-Total shambles, as per usual.
-Thanks.
Go on, look at that!
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!
Stay together! Keep up, girls!
Look!
Come on! Keep up, girls!
Blimey!
Parting of the ways, l think, old chap.
-See you at the match.
-See you.
-Cedric.
-Ced, come on.
See you later, Cedric.
Home sweet home.
What?
-Excellent, excellent.
-Ginny, look!
-All to the bath.
-Look.
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.
-Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
-Feet off the table!
-Feet off the table!
-Feet off the table!
l love magic.
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?
Well, put it this way:
lf it rains. . .
. . .you'll be the first to know.
Father and l are in
the minister's box. . .
. . .by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.
Don't boast, Draco.
There's no need with these people.
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?
While you can.
Come on up. Take your seats. l told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.
Come on!
lt's the lrish! There's Troy!
-And Mullet!
-And Moran!
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!
-Here come the Bulgarians!
-Yes!
Who's that?
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.
Krum! Krum! Krum!
Krum!
Yes!
Good evening!
As Minister for Magic. . .
. . .it gives me great pleasure. . .
. . .to welcome
each and every one of you. . .
. . .to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!
Let the match. . .
. . .begin!
Krum! Krum! Krum!
There's no one like Krum.
-Krum?
-Dumb Krum?
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.
-He's more than an athlete.
-Dumb Krum.
He's an artist.
-l think you're in love, Ron.
-Shut up.
Viktor, I love you
Viktor, I do
When we're apart
My heart beats only for you
Sounds like the lrish
have got their pride on.
Stop! Stop it!
lt's not the lrish.
We've gotta get out of here. Now!
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.
Go!
Harry!
-Keep up, you lot!
-Harry!
Harry! Harry!
Morsmordre!
Harry!
-Where are you?
-Harry!
We've been looking for you for ages!
Thought we lost you, mate.
What is that?
Stupefy!
Stop!
That's my son!
-Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
-We came back for Harry.
Which of you conjured it?
-Crouch, you can't possi--
-Do not lie!
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.
-Crime?
-Barty! They're just kids.
What crime?
lt's the Dark Mark, Harry.
lt's his mark.
What, Voldemort?
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?
-His followers?
-Yeah.
Death Eaters.
-Follow me.
-There was a man, before.
There!
All of you, this way!
A man, Harry?
Who?
l don't know.
l didn't see his face.
Anything from the trolley?
Anything from the trolley?
Anything from the trolley, dears?
Packet of Drooble's. . .
. . .and a Licorice Wand.
On second thought, just the Drooble's.
-lt's all right, l'll get it. Don't worry.
-Just the Drooble's. Thanks.
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.
Thank you.
Anything sweet for you, dear?
Oh, no, l'm not hungry. Thank you.
Anything from the trolley?
This is horrible.
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?
Wasn't there any security or. . .?
Loads, according to Dad.
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.
lt's hurting again, isn't it?
Your scar.
l'm fine.
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this. . .
. . .what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.
Hedwig. There we go.
Clear the runway!
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.
Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.
This castle will not only be
your home this year. . .
. . .but home to some
very special guests as well.
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen. . . .
Yes, what is it?
What is it?
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:
The Triwizard Tournament.
-For those of you who do not know. . .
-Brilliant.
. . .the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools. . .
. . .for a series of magical contests.
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.
Now let me be clear.
lf chosen, you stand alone.
And trust me when l say. . .
. . .these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming. . .
. . .the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. . .
. . .and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.
Bloody hell.
Blimey. That's one big woman.
And now our friends from the north.
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang. . .
. . .and their high master,
lgor Karkaroff.
Oh, it's Krum!
Blimey, it's him!
Viktor Krum!
Albus.
lgor.
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.
-They will need attending to.
-Don't worry, Madame Maxime.
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid. . .
. . .they drink only single-malt whiskey.
You idiot!
Your attention, please!
l'd like to say a few words.
Eternal glory.
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.
Three extremely dangerous tasks.
-Wicked.
-Wicked.
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.
To explain all this. . .
. . .we have the head of the Department
of lnternational Magical Cooperation. . .
. . .Mr. Bartemius Crouch.
Bloody hell. lt's Mad-Eye Moody.
-Alastor Moody? The Auror?
-Auror?
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.
-My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
-Stupid ceiling.
Thank you.
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?
l don't know, but l don't think
it's pumpkin juice.
After due consideration. . .
. . .the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety. . .
. . .no student under the age of 1 7. . .
. . .shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.
-This decision is final.
-That's rubbish!
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!
-Silence!
-They're not too happy about that, then.
The Goblet of Fire.
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament. . .
. . .need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment. . .
. . .and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.
Do not do so lightly.
lf chosen, there's no turning back.
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.
Alastor Moody.
Ex-Auror. . .
. . .Ministry malcontent. . .
. . .and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
l am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.
Any questions?
When it comes to the Dark Arts. . .
. . .l believe in a practical approach.
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?
-Three, sir.
-And they are so named?
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will--
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.
l say different! You need to know
what you're up against!
You need to be prepared.
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum. . .
. . .besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.
And hear across classrooms!
So which curse shall we see first?
-Weasley!
-Yes?
Stand.
Give us a curse.
Well, my dad did tell me about one.
The lmperius Curse.
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.
Perhaps this will show you why.
Hello.
Lovely little beauty.
Engorgio.
Imperio!
Don't worry. lt's completely harmless.
lf she bites. . .
. . .she's lethal.
What are you laughing at?
Get off!
Talented, isn't she?
What should l have her do next?
Jump out the window?
Drown herself?
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed. . .
. . .that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding. . .
. . .under the influence
of the lmperius Curse.
But here's the rub:
How do we sort out the liars?
Another, another.
Up, up. Come on.
Longbottom, is it?
Up.
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.
There's the. . . .
The Cruciatus Curse.
Correct, correct. Come, come.
Particularly nasty.
The torture curse.
Crucio!
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.
No?
Avada Kedavra!
The Killing Curse.
Only one person is known
to have survived it. . .
. . .and he's sitting in this room.
Brilliant, isn't he?
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with. . .
. . .but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.
To perform them in a classroom. . . .
l mean, did you see Neville's face?
Neville?
Son?
You all right?
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
l want to show you something.
We're gonna be late!
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.
Yeah, rather you than me.
Yes!
Thank you, thank you.
-Well, lads, we've done it.
-Cooked it up just this morning.
lt's not going to work.
-Oh, yeah?
-And why is that, Granger?
You see this? This is an Age Line.
Dumbledore drew it himself.
So?
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled. . .
. . .by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.
-But that's why it's so brilliant.
-Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.
-Ready, Fred?
-Ready, George.
-Bottoms up.
-Bottoms up.
-Yes!
-Yes!
Yeah!
Yes!
Ready?
-Yes!
-Yes!
-You said!
-You said!
-Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
-l'll tear your ears off!
-Now you're making me laugh.
-Take this! Come on!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
We're ''old school,'' right?
Yeah, but you look older!
Sit down. Please.
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:
The champion selection.
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.
The champion for Beauxbatons. . .
. . .is Fleur Delacour.
The Hogwarts champion,
Cedric Diggory!
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions. . .
. . .this vessel of victory. . .
. . .the Triwizard Cup!
Harry Potter.
Harry Potter?
No. No.
Harry Potter!
Go on, Harry.
Harry, for goodness sake.
He's a cheat!
He's not even 1 7 yet!
-lt's wrong, l tell you!
-You French tart.
-Everything is a conspiracy theory!
-Quiet! l can't think!
-Everything is a conspiracy theory!
-l protest.
-Harry.
-l protest!
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?
-No, sir.
-Did you ask one of the older students. . .
-. . .to do it for you?
-No, sir.
-You're absolutely sure?
-Yes. Yes, sir.
-But of course he is lying.
-The hell he is!
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could've hoodwinked it.
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.
lt was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff. . .
-. . .perhaps you remember.
-This doesn't help, Alastor.
Leave this to you, Barty.
The rules are absolute.
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.
Mr. Potter has no choice.
He is, as of tonight. . .
. . .a Triwizard champion.
This can't go on, Albus.
First the Dark Mark. Now this?
What do you suggest, Minerva?
Put an end to it.
Don't let Potter compete.
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?
Headmaster, l, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events. . .
. . .perhaps we should,
for the time being. . .
. . .let them unfold.
What--? Do nothing?
Offer him up as bait?
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.
l agree. With Severus.
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?
-l can do that.
-Don't let him know, though.
He must be anxious enough as it is. . .
. . .knowing what lies ahead.
Then again, we all are.
How did you do it?
Never mind. Doesn't matter.
Might've let
your best friend know, though.
-Let you know what?
-You know bloody well what.
l didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.
Okay?
-You're being stupid.
-Yeah, that's me.
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.
l didn't put my name in that cup.
l don't want eternal glory.
l just wanna be. . . .
Look, l don't know
what happened tonight. . .
. . .and l don't know why.
lt just did.
Okay?
Piss off.
What a charismatic quartet.
Hello.
l'm Rita Skeeter.
l write for the Daily Prophet.
But of course you know that, don't you?
lt's you we don't know.
You're the juicy news.
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?
What mysteries do the muscles mask?
Does courage lie beneath those curls?
ln short, what makes a champion tick?
''Me, Myself & l'' want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.
So who's feeling up to sharing?
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.
This is cozy.
lt's a broom cupboard.
You should feel right at home, then.
Don't mind if l use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?
No.
So tell me, Harry.
Here you sit, a mere boy of 1 2--
l'm 1 4. Sorry.
--about to compete
against three students. . .
. . .not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself. . .
. . .but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt. . .
. . .in your dizziest daydreams.
Concerned?
l don't know.
l haven't really thought about it.
Just ignore the quill.
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 1 2, are you?
-Fourteen.
-Your story's legend.
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past. . .
. . .that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?
No, l didn't enter.
Of course you didn't.
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.
Scratch that last.
Speaking of your parents,
were they alive. . .
. . .how do you think they'd feel?
Proud? Or concerned. . .
. . .that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention. . .
. . .at worst, a psychotic death wish?
Hey, my eyes aren't
''glistening with the ghosts of my past. ''
Harry, I couldn 't risk sending Hedwig.
Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...
...and she's too easily recognized.
We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.
Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.
And make sure you're alone.
Sirius.
P.S.:
The bird bites.
Sirius?
Harry Potter, age 1 2...
...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.
His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...
...and choking back tears....
Sirius. How--?
l don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?
No!
l had to ask.
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.
But who was the third man in the room?
-l don't know.
-You didn't hear a name?
No.
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.
And what was that?
He wanted. . .
. . .me.
l don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.
But, l mean, it was only a dream, right?
Yes.
lt's just a dream.
Look, Harry.
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet. . .
. . .these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.
What are you saying?
l'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. lgor Karkaroff?
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.
Then there's Barty Crouch.
Heart of stone.
Sent his own son to Azkaban.
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?
l haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet. . .
. . .but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.
-l'm not ready for this, Sirius.
-You don't have a choice.
-Someone's coming.
-Keep your friends close, Harry.
-Who were you talking to?
-What?
-Who says l was talking to anyone?
-l heard voices.
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, l expect.
Amazing.
-Amazing!
-Neville. You're doing it again.
Right, sorry.
''Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs''?
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.
lt's already been through enough people.
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.
What do you want me to say again?
Go.
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him. . .
. . .that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.
ls that right? Well, you--
What?
-Are you sure you won't do this?
-Do it.
Dean was told by Parvati that. . . .
Please don't ask me to say it again.
Hagrid's looking for you.
-Well, you can tell Ronald--
-l'm not an owl!
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like l asked you?
Yeah, l brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?
You'll see soon enough.
Now pay attention, this is important.
What's with the flower?
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?
As a matter of fact, l have.
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.
Hagrid?
The cloak! Put the cloak on!
-Bonsoir, Olympe.
-Oh, Hagrid.
l thought perhaps you weren't coming.
l thought perhaps. . .
. . .you had forgotten me.
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.
What is it you wanted to show me?
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so. . .
. . .exhilarated.
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.
Can we get closer?
Dragons?
That's the first task?
-You're joking.
-Come on, Harry.
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.
Oh, crikey!
Although, l have to admit. . .
. . .that Horntail is a right nasty
piece of work.
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.
-Ron was here?
-Oh, sure.
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.
Didn't Ron tell you that?
No, he didn't.
He didn't tell me a thing.
-You cheat, Potter.
-You stink, Potter.
-Good luck, Potter.
-Potter stinks!
-Cedric rules.
-Thanks.
Like the badge?
Excuse me.
Harry.
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!
Can l have a word?
-All right.
-You stink, Potter!
-Potter, you stink!
-Harry Potter smells!
Dragons. That's the first task.
-They've got one for each of us.
-Come on, Ced!
Are you serious?
And Fleur and Krum, do they--?
-Yes.
-Come on, Ced, leave him.
-Right.
-He's not worth it.
-Read the badges, Potter!
-Hey, listen. About the badges.
-l've asked them not to wear them, but--
-Don't worry about it.
lt's not like l try
to blow things up, exactly.
lt just happens a fair bit.
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.
You're a right foul git, you know that?
-You think so?
-l know so.
Anything else?
-Yeah. Stay away from me.
-Fine.
-There's Potter. Cheat.
-Why so tense, Potter?
My father and l have a bet, you see.
l don't think you're gonna last
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.
l don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.
-Pathetic?
-Oh, no, you don't, sonny!
l'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!
You stinking, cowardly, scummy. . .
-Professor Moody!
-. . .back-shooting--
-What are you doing?
-Teaching.
-ls that a--? ls that a student?
-Technically, it's a ferret.
Stand still! Stand still!
-My father will hear about this!
-ls that a threat?
-Professor Moody!
-ls that a threat?
Professor!
l could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!
-Alastor! Alastor.
-lt doesn't end here!
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!
Surely Dumbledore told you that.
-He might've mentioned it.
-Well, you will do well to remember it.
Away!
You. Come with me.
That's a Foe-Glass.
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.
lf l can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.
You wouldn't believe it if l did.
Now. . .
. . .what are you going to do
about your dragon?
Well, you know, l just thought l'd. . . .
Sit.
Listen to me, Potter.
Your pal Diggory?
By your age, he could turn a whistle into
a watch and have it sing you the time.
Miss Delacour?
She's as much a fairy princess as l am.
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust. . .
. . .but Karkaroff's is not.
They'll have a strategy.
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.
Come on, Potter.
What are your strengths?
l don't know.
Well, l can fly.
l mean, l'm a fair flyer. But l. . . .
-Better than fair, the way l heard it.
-But l'm not allowed a broom.
You're allowed a wand.
Bets! Place your bets!
Bets taken! Bets taken here!
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?
Yes, sir?
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.
Your attention, please.
This is a great day for all of us.
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.
Please keep your seats at all times.
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.
-Harry? ls that you?
-Yeah.
I'm sure we all wish our champions...
-How are you feeling? Okay?
-... the greatest of luck.
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to--
Battle a dragon.
Young love.
How. . .
. . .stirring.
lf everything goes unfortunately today. . .
. . .you two may even
make the front page.
You have no business here.
This tent is for champions. . .
. . .and friends.
No matter. We've got what we wanted.
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?
Sorry, l'll just go.
Barty, the bag.
Champions, in a circle around me.
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now. . .
. . .Miss Delacour, if you will.
The Welsh Green.
Mr. Krum.
The Chinese Fireball.
The Swedish Short-Snout.
-Which leaves. . . .
-The Horntail.
-What's that, boy?
-Nothing.
The Hungarian Horntail.
These represent four
very real dragons. . .
. . .each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.
Your objective is simple:
Collect the egg.
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue. . .
. . .without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.
Any questions?
Very well. Good luck, champions.
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may--
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...
...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.
And now our fourth
and final contestant.
Harry! Harry! Harry!
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!
Accio Firebolt!
-Yeah!
-Yes!
Oh, my God.
-Yeah!
-Yeah! Well done, dragon!
Yes! Yes!
-Yes, Harry!
-Knew you wouldn't die. Lose a leg.
-Or an arm.
-Pack it in altogether?
-Never!
-Never!
Shush!
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?
-Who wants me to open it?
-Yes!
-Do you want me to open it?
-Yes!
What the bloody hell was that?
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.
l reckon you have to be barking mad to
put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.
l wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.
Everyone was saying it
behind your back.
Brilliant.
That makes me feel loads better.
-Least l warned you about the dragons.
-Hagrid warned me about the dragons.
No, no, no, l did.
No, don't you remember?
l told Hermione to tell you. . .
. . .that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.
l thought we'd be all right, you know. . .
. . .after you'd figured that out.
Who--? Who could possibly
figure that out?
That's completely mental.
Yeah. lsn't it?
l suppose l was a bit distraught.
Boys.
-Hi, Harry.
-Hi, Harry.
Cho, Harry's looking at you.
Shush.
Look at this!
l can't believe it! She's done it again.
''Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl. . .
. . .seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.
Her latest prey, sources report. . .
. . .is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.
No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow. ''
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.
Thank you, Nigel.
Not now, Nigel. Later.
Go on.
l told him l'd get him Harry's autograph.
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.
Mum sent me a dress.
Well, it does match your eyes.
ls there a bonnet?
Nose down, Harry.
-Ginny, these must be for you.
-l'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.
What are you on about?
They're not for Ginny.
They're for you.
-Dress robes.
-Dress robes? For what?
The Yule Ball. . .
. . .has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament. . .
. . .since its inception.
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests. . .
. . .gather in the Great Hall. . .
. . .for a night of well-mannered frivolity.
As representatives of the host school. . .
. . .l expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.
And l mean this literally, because. . .
. . .the Yule Ball is, first and foremost. . .
. . .a dance.
Silence!
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect. . .
. . .of the wizard world
for nearly 1 0 centuries.
l will not have you, in the course of a
single evening, besmirching that name. . .
. . .by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.
Try saying that five times fast, huh?
Now, to dance. . .
. . .is to let the body breathe.
lnside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers. . .
. . .longing to burst forth
and take flight.
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but l don't think it's a swan.
lnside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.
-Mr. Weasley.
-Yes?
Will you join me, please?
Now, place your right hand
on my waist.
-Where?
-My waist.
And extend your arm.
Mr. Filch, if you please.
One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.
Never gonna let him forget this,
are you?
-Never.
-Never.
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!
Why do they have to travel in packs?
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
lf you can't get a date, who can?
l think l'd take the dragon right now.
l take after my mum.
Though l didn't know her very well.
She left when l was about 3.
No, not the maternal sort, her.
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.
l could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.
He laughed so hard at that.
Very funny.
And then he died
just when l started school, so. . . .
So l sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.
But enough of me. What about you?
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.
Well, us and Neville.
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.
lt might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.
Now l'm really depressed.
''Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone. ''
Who you going with, then?
-Oi, Angelina?
-What?
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?
To the ball?
Yeah, all right.
Oi, Hermione.
You're a girl.
Very well spotted.
Come with one of us?
Come on. lt's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.
For a girl, it's just sad.
l won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!
And l said yes!
Bloody hell.
She's lying, right?
lf you say so.
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.
Tonight, when we get back
to the common room. . .
. . .we'll both have partners. Agreed?
Agreed.
-Cho!
-Harry!
Watch yourself on the stairs.
lt's a bit icy at the top.
Okay, thanks.
Cho?
Yes?
Well, l just wondered if you--
l wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.
Sorry, l didn't catch that.
l was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.
Harry. . .
. . .l'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.
And. . . .
Well, l've said l'll go with him.
Okay. Yeah. Great.
Fine. No problem.
Okay. Good.
Harry?
l really am. . .
. . .sorry.
lt's all right, Ron.
lt's okay, Ron. lt's all right.
lt doesn't matter.
What happened to you?
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.
-What?
-What did she say?
No, of course.
-She said yes?
-Don't be silly.
There she was, walking by.
You know how l like it when they walk.
l couldn't help it.
lt just sort of slipped out.
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
lt was a bit frightening.
-And what did you do then?
-What else? l ran for it.
l'm not cut out for this, Harry.
l don't know what got into me.
-Hi, Harry.
-Hi, Harry.
l always liked looking at them
from behind.
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.
Hey!
Bloody hell.
Bloody hell.
Bloody. . . .
Oh, bloody. . . .
What are those? What are those?
-My dress robes.
-Well, they're all right!
No lace. No dodgy little collar.
Well, l expect yours are more traditional.
Traditional?! They're ancient!
l look like my Great Aunt Tessie!
l smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.
Murder me, Harry.
Leave it alone!
Poor kid. l bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.
-Who?
-Hermione, of course.
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.
-Hello, boys.
-Hello, boys.
Don't you look. . .
. . .dashing.
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?
-Ready, professor?
-To dance.
lt's traditional that the three champions--
Well, in this case, four.
--are the first to dance.
-Surely l told you that.
-No.
Well, now you know.
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.
-Oh, there you are.
-Come on, then.
Come along this way.
Oh, come on.
-Hi.
-Now, l need you all to line up. . .
. . .in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.
This way. This way. Come along.
She looks beautiful!
Yeah, she does.
ls that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?
No. Absolutely not.
Hi!
Harry, take my waist.
-What?
-Now!
Are you ready?
Move your body like a hairy troll
Learning to rock and roll
Spin around like a crazy elf
Dancing by himself
Boogie down like a unicorn
No stopping till the break of dawn
Put your hands up in the air
Like an ogre who just don 't care
Can you dance like a Hippogriff?
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?
l don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.
May l have your arm?
Arm. Leg. l'm yours.
Hot, isn't it?
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.
What's got your wand in a knot?
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament. . .
. . .is international
magical cooperation. . .
. . .to make friends.
l think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?
No.
-He's using you.
-How dare you?!
-Besides, l can take care of myself.
-l doubt it. He's way too old.
-What?! What? That's what you think?
-Yeah, that's what l think.
You know the solution then, don't you?
-Go on.
-Next time there's a ball. . .
. . .pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!
And not as a last resort.
Well, that's-- l mean,
that's just completely off the point.
Harry.
Where have you been?
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.
-They get scary when they get older.
-Ron, you spoiled everything!
What's this about?
No, don 't let
This magic die
The answer's there
Let me see it again.
Yes, the time is close now.
Harry, at last!
Step aside, Wormtail,
so l can give our guest a proper greeting.
You all right, Harry?
l just got in.
Me.
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.
-The task is two days from now.
-Really? l had no idea.
l suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.
l just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.
Mostly, he watches me study.
lt's a bit annoying, actually.
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?
What's that supposed to mean?
lt just means these tasks
are designed to test you. . .
. . .in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.
And. . .
. . .l'm scared for you.
You got by the dragons
mostly on nerve.
l'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.
Hey, Potter!
-Potter!
-Cedric.
How--? How are you?
Spectacular.
l realize l never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.
Forget it. l'm sure you
would've done the same for me.
Exactly.
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?
lt's not a bad place for a bath.
Just take your egg. . .
. . .and mull things over
in the hot water.
l must be out of my mind.
l'm definitely out of my mind.
l'd try putting it in the water
if l were you.
Myrtle!
Hello, Harry.
Long time no see.
l was circling a blocked drain
the other day. . .
. . .and could swear l saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?
Polyjuice Potion?
Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
''Try putting it in the water''?
That's what he did.
The other boy. . .
. . .the handsome one. . .
. . .Cedric.
Well, go on. Open it.
Come seek us
Where our voices sound
We cannot sing
Above the ground
An hour long you'll have to look
To recover what we took
Myrtle. . .
. . .there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?
Very good.
lt took Cedric ages to riddle it out.
Almost all the bubbles were gone.
Harry, tell me again.
''Come seek us
where our voices sound. ''
The Black Lake, that's obvious.
''An hour long you'll have to look. ''
Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.
''Potentially problematic''?
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.
Hate to break up the skull session.
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and--
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now. . .
. . .and could do with
a good night's sleep.
Go. Now!
Longbottom!
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.
You know,
if you're interested in plants. . .
. . .you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?
Neville, no offense,
but l really don't care. . .
. . .about plants.
Now, if there's. . .
. . .a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour. . .
. . .then great. But otherwise--
l don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.
-Any bets? Any bets?
-Come on, place your bets!
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.
-Three lads.
-One lady.
-Four go down.
-But do four come up?
Don't be so mean.
-Any bets?
-Fleur's 1 0-1 .
-You're sure about this, Neville?
-Absolutely.
-For an hour?
-Most likely.
Most likely?
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists. . .
. . .as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water--
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!
l just wanted to help.
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.
Where are they anyway?
-You seem a little tense, Harry.
-Do l?
Welcome to the second task.
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.
A treasure of sorts.
These four treasures,
one for each champion...
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.
In order to win...
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.
-Simple enough, except for this:
-Put that in your mouth.
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.
You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.
-What's the matter with him?
-l don't know, l can't see him.
Oh, my God.
l've killed Harry Potter.
Yeah!
What?
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...
...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...
...so she will take no further part
in this task.
But she's my friend too!
Only one!
Let's get down below.
Krum! Krum! Krum!
Yes!
Ascendio!
Harry!
He's all right.
He's all right. Barty!
-Go get him another towel.
-l want all the judges over here now!
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.
My little sister.
Thank you.
And you! You helped.
Well, yeah, a bit.
-Harry!
-Hermione!
Are you all right? You must be freezing.
Personally, l think
you behaved admirably.
l finished last, Hermione.
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.
Krum! Krum! Krum!
-Come on! Come on!
-Attention!
Attention!
The winner is Mr. Diggory. . .
. . .who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first. . .
. . .had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley. . .
. . .but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him. . .
. . .second place. . .
-Second place!
-Well done!
. . .for outstanding moral fiber!
Yes!
-Right on.
-All that moral fiber, eh?
-lt's great.
-Moral fiber?
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.
-Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
-Congratulations, Potter.
-A fine achievement.
-Thank you.
Well done, boy.
-See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
-l'm sorry we haven't spoken.
After all, your story is one
l've heard so many times.
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course. . .
. . .to lose one's family.
Never whole again, are we?
Still, life goes on. . .
. . .and here we stand.
l'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.
Bartemius!
Not trying to lure Potter into one of the
Ministry's summer internships, are we?
The last boy who went into the
Department of Mysteries never came out!
And they say l'm mad.
Now, l remember--
l remember when l first met you all.
Biggest bunch of misfits
l ever set eyes on.
Suppose you remind me
of meself a little.
-And here we all are, four years later.
-We're still a bunch of misfits.
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.
And Harry, of course.
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!
Hooray!
Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts
Teach us something, please
Mr. Crouch?
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.
l will not.
ln times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!
Then for once show them some!
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. l will not be seen as a coward!
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.
-What did you say to me?
-Excuse me, gentlemen.
lt may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.
Oh, Harry!
Harry, how good to see you again.
l can come back later, professor.
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and l
are done. l'll be back in a moment.
Minister, after you.
There you are. Your hat.
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.
But l have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.
Professor?
-Professor.
-Yeah.
lgor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request. . .
. . .to present evidence to this council.
Should your testimony
prove consequential. . .
. . .council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.
Do you accept these terms?
-l do, sir.
-And what do you wish to present?
l have names, sir.
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.
-Rosier is dead.
-He took a piece of me with him. . .
-. . .though, didn't he?
-l didn't know.
-lf that is all the witness has to offer--
-No, no, no.
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?
Yeah, the same.
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.
Very well. Council will deliberate.
ln the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.
No! Wait, please! Please, l have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?
As the council is aware,
l've given evidence on this matter.
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall. . .
-. . .turned spy for us at great personal risk.
-lt's a lie!
-Today he's no more a Death Eater than l.
-Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!
Silence!
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence. . .
. . .this session is now concluded.
Oh, no, no, no.
l've heard about one more.
-What's that?
-The name.
-Yes?
-l know for a fact. . .
. . .this person took part
in the capture. . .
. . .and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse. . .
. . .torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!
The name.
Give me the wretched name!
Barty Crouch. . .
. . .Junior.
Hold him down!
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!
Hello, Father.
You are no son of mine.
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.
lt's a Pensieve.
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.
lt allows me to see once more
things l've already seen.
You see, Harry, l have searched
and searched for something. . .
. . .some small detail. . .
. . .something l might have overlooked. . .
. . .something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.
Every time l get close to an answer,
it slips away.
lt's maddening.
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.
What exactly happened to him?
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.
-Why do you ask?
-lt's just that l. . . .
l had a dream about him.
lt was in the summer, before school.
In the dream, I was in a house.
And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn 't quite human.
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch 's son.
-Have there been others like this dream?
-Yes.
Always the same one.
Sir, these dreams. . .
. . .what l see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?
l think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.
l think it's best if you simply. . .
. . .cast them away.
lt's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as l.
Potter!
What's your hurry?
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.
Gillyweed, am l correct?
Yes, sir.
lngenious.
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.
Not something found
in your everyday garden.
Nor is this.
Know what it is?
Bubble juice, sir?
Veritaserum.
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However. . .
. . .should you ever steal
from my personal stores again. . .
. . .my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.
-l haven't stolen anything.
-Don't lie to me.
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me. . .
. . .l'm going to find out why!
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
Sonorus!
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory. . .
. . .and Mr. Potter. . .
. . .are tied for first position. . .
. . .they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum. . .
-. . .and Miss Delacour.
-Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!
l've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task. . .
. . .he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!
ln the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.
lnstead, you'll face something
even more challenging.
You see, people change in the maze.
Oh, find the cup if you can.
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.
Champions, prepare yourselves!
Good luck.
-My boy.
-See you later, Dad.
On the count of three. One--
Fleur?
Fleur.
Periculum!
Get down!
Get down!
Expelliarmus!
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!
-Get off me!
-He's bewitched!
Yes.
Harry!
Harry!
Harry!
Harry!
Reducto!
-Thanks.
-No problem.
You know, for a moment there,
l thought you were gonna let it get me.
For a moment, so did l.
Some game, huh?
Some game.
Go!
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!
-Together. One, two. . .
-Two. . .
-. . .three!
-. . .three!
-You okay?
-Yeah. You?
Where are we?
l've been here before.
lt's a Portkey.
-Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
-l've been here before, in a dream.
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!
What are you talking about?
-Harry! What is it?
-Get back to the cup!
-Who are you? What do you want?
-Kill the spare.
-Avada Kedavra!
-No! Cedric!
Do it! Now!
Bone of the father. . .
. . .unwillingly given.
Flesh of the servant. . .
. . .willingly sacrificed.
And blood of the enemy. . .
. . .forcibly taken.
The Dark Lord shall rise. . .
. . .again.
My wand, Wormtail.
Hold out your arm.
Master.
Thank you, master.
The other arm, Wormtail.
Welcome, my friends.
Thirteen years it's been, and yet. . .
. . .here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.
l confess myself. . .
. . .disappointed.
Not one of you tried to find me.
Crabbe! Macnair!
Goyle!
Not even you. . .
. . .Lucius.
My Lord, had l detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts--
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.
l assure you, my Lord,
l have never renounced the old ways.
The face l have been obliged to present
each day since your absence. . .
. . .that is my true mask.
l returned.
Out of fear, not loyalty.
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.
Thank you, master.
Thank you.
-Such a handsome boy.
-Don't touch him!
Harry.
l'd almost forgotten you were here.
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.
l'd introduce you. . .
. . .but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.
The boy who lived.
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.
Shall l reveal what really happened
that night 1 3 years ago?
Shall l divulge how
l truly lost my powers?
Yes, shall l?
lt was love.
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son. . .
. . .she provided the ultimate protection.
l could not touch him.
lt was old magic.
Something l should have foreseen.
But no matter, no matter.
Things have changed.
l can touch you. . .
. . .now.
Yeah.
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?
Pick up your wand, Potter.
l said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!
You've been taught how to duel,
l presume, yes?
First, we bow to each other.
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?
l said, bow.
-That's better. And now. . . .
-No.
Crucio!
Crucio!
Attaboy, Harry.
Your parents would be proud.
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.
Expelliar--
l'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.
l'm going to destroy you.
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.
After tonight, if they speak of you. . .
. . .they'll speak only of how you. . .
. . .begged for death.
And l, being a merciful Lord. . .
. . .obliged.
Get up!
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!
l want you to look at me
when l kill you!
l want to see the light
leave your eyes!
Have it your way.
-Expelliarmus!
-Avada Kedavra!
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!
He's mine!
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time. . .
. . .but only a moment.
Do you understand?
Harry, take my body back, will you?
Take my body back to my father.
Let go.
Sweetheart, you're ready.
Let go! Let go!
Accio!
No!
He did it!
Harry!
Harry!
No! No! No, don't!
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?
He's back. He's back.
Voldemort's back.
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.
l couldn't leave him, not there.
lt's all right, Harry. lt's all right.
He's home. You both are.
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.
Let me through.
Let me through!
Let me through!
That's my son!
That's my boy!
lt's my boy!
-Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
-No.
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.
No!
lt's all right, l got you.
l got you. Come on. Easy, now.
No!
No!
Are you all right, Potter?
Does it hurt? That?
Not so much now.
Perhaps l'd better take a look at it.
The cup was a Portkey.
Someone had bewitched it.
What was it like?
-What was he like?
-Who?
The Dark Lord.
What was it like
to stand in his presence?
l don't know.
lt was like l'd fallen
into one of my dreams. . .
. . .into one of my nightmares.
Were there others?
ln the graveyard, were there others?
l. . . .
l don't think l said anything
about a graveyard, professor.
''Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?''
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods. . .
. . .if l hadn't suggested it?
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater. . .
. . .if l hadn't told him first myself?
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder. . .
. . .could've provided you with gillyweed
if l hadn't given him the book. . .
. . .that led him straight to it?
lt was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.
-You bewitched Krum, but you--
-''But-- But--''
You won because l made it so, Potter.
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.
And now the deed is done.
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.
lmagine how he will reward me
when he learns. . .
. . .that l have once and for all. . .
. . .silenced the great Harry Potter.
Expelliarmus!
Severus.
That's it, take it.
-Do you know who l am?
-Albus Dumbledore.
-Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
-No.
ls he in this room? ls he in this room?
Harry, away from there!
-You all right, Alastor?
-l'm sorry, Albus.
That's Moody. But then who's--?
Polyjuice Potion.
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.
We'll get you up in a minute.
Harry!
Barty Crouch Junior.
l'll show you mine
if you show me yours.
Your arm, Harry.
You know what this means, don't you?
He's back.
Lord Voldemort has returned.
l'm sorry, sir. l couldn't help it.
Send an owl to Azkaban. l think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.
-l'll be welcomed back like a hero.
-Perhaps.
Personally, l've never had much time
for heroes.
Today, we acknowledge. . .
. . .a really terrible loss.
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know. . .
. . .exceptionally hard-working. . .
. . .infinitely fair-minded. . .
. . .and, most importantly. . .
. . .a fierce, fierce friend.
Now, l think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.
You see. . .
. . .Cedric Diggory was murdered. . .
. . .by Lord Voldemort!
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.
But not to do so, l think,
would be an insult to his memory.
Now, the pain. . .
. . .we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me. . .
. . .and reminds us. . .
. . .that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues. . .
. . .our hearts beat as one.
ln light of recent events. . .
. . .the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.
You remember that. . .
. . .and we'll celebrate a boy who was. . .
. . .kind and honest. . .
. . .and brave and true,
right to the very end.
l never liked these curtains.
Set them on fire in my fourth year.
By accident, of course.
l put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. l'm sorry.
Professor. . .
. . .when l was in the graveyard,
there was a moment. . .
. . .when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.
Priori Incantatem.
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?
They reappeared.
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
l trust you know that.
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.
But remember this:
You have friends here.
You're not alone.
Hermione.
This is for you.
Write to me. Promise.
Bye.
Au revoir, Ron.
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?
-No.
-No.
No, l didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?
Yes.
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.
l won't. You know l won't.
-Harry will, won't you?
-Yeah. Every week.
I don't know about you, it's
just too hot today, isn't it?
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.
So, please, remember to
cover up and stay cool...
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.
Come on, guys, time to go home.
Come on, love, off you get.
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.
I'll make you your favorite
dinner to compensate.
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?
Hey, Big D.
Beat up another
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.
"Don't kill Cedric."
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."
Where is your mum?
Where is your mum, Potter?
She dead?
Is she dead?
Is she a dead Pott...?
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.
Dudley, run.
Expecto Patronum.
Mrs. Figg.
Don't put away your wand, Harry.
They might come back.
Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next?
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy. -
I don't understand. How do you know...?
Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.
Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore?
After You-Know-Who killed that
poor Diggory boy last year...
...did you expect him to let
you go wandering on your own?
Good Lord, boy. They told
me you were intelligent.
Now, get inside and stay there.
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.
There's sweat. There's stifling.
Diddykins?
Is that you?
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.
We're going to have to take him to a hospital.
Who did this to you, boy?
Happy, are we, now?
You've finally done it. You've
finally driven him loopy.
Vernon, don't say that.
Well, just look at him,
Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy.
I've reached my limit, do you hear?
This is the last I'm gonna
take of you and your nonsense.
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...
...you performed the Patronus
Charm in the presence of a Muggle.
As a clear violation...
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...
...you are hereby expelled...
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.
Justice.
He's not very well.
Sorry, Hedwig.
Very clean, these Muggles.
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.
Professor Moody.
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.
But where are we going? The
letter said I've been expelled.
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.
But the letter said...
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...
- ... pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.
Not here, Nymphadora.
Don't call me Nymphadora.
Stay in formation, everyone. Don't
break ranks if one of us is killed.
Come on, you, around the corner.
Come on.
In you go, son.
There've been no sightings.
No deaths. No proof.
He almost killed Harry. If
that isn't proof enough...
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...
We must trust Dumbledore on this.
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.
Cornelius Fudge is a politician
first and a wizard second.
- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your voices down.
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
Heavens, you're all right.
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will
wait until after the meeting's finished.
Nope. No time to explain. Straight
upstairs, first door on the left.
Yeah.
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.
If my poor mistress knew the
scum they let into her house...
...what would she say to old Kreacher?
Oh, the shame.
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.
Scum of the earth. Not like it
was in the days of my fathers.
Kreacher is here.
Oh, Harry.
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.
And this hearing at the
Ministry. It's just outrageous.
I've looked it up. They
simply can't expel you.
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.
So, what is this place?
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.
It's a secret society.
Dumbledore formed it back
when they fought You-Know-Who.
Couldn't have put any of
this in a letter, I suppose?
I've gone all summer without a scrap of news.
We wanted to write, mate. Really, we did.
- Only...
- Only what?
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.
Dumbledore said that?
But why would he keep me in
the dark? Maybe I could help.
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...
...the one who fought him, who
saw Cedric Diggory get killed.
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.
- Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.
- If you're all done shouting...
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?
If anyone has a right to know, it's
Harry. If it wasn't for Harry...
...we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back.
He's not a child, Molly.
But he's not an adult either.
- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.
He's as good as.
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.
- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be
a felon, just like his godfather.
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.
...about your supposed reformation.
- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?
- Get off it.
- Quick.
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.
Just because you're
allowed to use magic now...
...does not mean you have to whip
your wands out for everything.
Hi, Mum.
You hungry, Harry?
You sure you're all right,
Harry? Gave us quite a turn.
Harry Potter.
Sirius.
This is very, very peculiar.
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.
I don't understand. What has the
Ministry of Magic got against me?
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.
Why?
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.
No one in their right
mind could believe that...
Exactly the point. Fudge
isn't in his right mind.
It's been twisted and warped by fear.
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.
The last time Voldemort gained power...
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid the
minister will do almost anything...
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.
We think Voldemort wants
to build up his army again.
Fourteen years ago, he had
huge numbers at his command.
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.
He's been recruiting heavily, and
we've been attempting to do the same.
But gathering followers isn't
the only thing he's interested in.
We believe...
...Voldemort may be after something.
Sirius.
Something he didn't have last time.
You mean like a weapon?
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.
You say more and you might as
well induct him into the Order.
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.
Harry.
You are hereby expelled.
Before the entire Wizengamot.
Trains. Underground.
Ingenious, these Muggles.
Here we are.
I've never used the visitors'
entrance before. Should be fun.
Right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money.
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.
Daily Prophet, ladies and
gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?
Dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous?
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.
Interdepartmental memos.
We used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable.
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.
- They've changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?
In five minutes.
Department of Mysteries.
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.
Yes, but we must be...
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.
As the Muggles say, truth will out.
Yes?
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.
Good luck, Harry.
Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August...
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...
...resident at Number 4 Privet
Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.
Interrogators: Cornelius
Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag...
Witness for the defense.
Albus Percival Wulfric...
...Brian Dumbledore.
You got our message that the
time and place of the hearing...
- ... had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.
But by a happy mistake, I arrived
at the Ministry three hours early.
The charges?
The charges against the
accused are as follows:
"That he did knowingly...
...and in full awareness of
the illegality of his actions...
...produce a Patronus Charm...
...in the presence of a Muggle."
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...
- ... while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...
I was only doing it because of the Dementors.
Dementors?
In Little Whinging?
That's quite clever.
Muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy?
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't...
- Enough.
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...
Pardon me, minister, but
as it happens, we can.
Please describe the attack.
What did they look like?
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.
Not the boys. The Dementors.
Oh, right, right. Well, big.
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.
Now, look here. Dementors don't
just wander into a Muggle suburb...
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.
I don't think anyone would believe...
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.
I'm sure I must have
misunderstood you, professor.
Dementors are, after all, under the
control of the Ministry of Magic.
And it's so silly of me, but it
sounded for a moment as though...
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.
That would be disturbing
indeed, Madam Undersecretary...
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...
...and why they mounted an
attack without authorization.
Of course, there is someone...
...who might be behind the attack.
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.
He is not back.
In the matter of Harry Potter...
...the law clearly states...
...that magic may be used before
Muggles in life-threatening situations.
Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...
...to deal with a simple
matter of underage magic?
Those in favor of conviction?
Those in favor of clearing
the accused of all charges?
Cleared of all charges.
Professor.
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?
You'll blow the entire operation.
Sirius, what are you doing
here? If somebody sees you...
I had to see you off, didn't I?
What's life without a little risk?
I don't wanna see you get
chucked back in Azkaban.
Don't worry about me.
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.
Original Order of the Phoenix.
Marlene McKinnon.
She was killed two weeks after this was taken.
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.
Frank and Alice Longbottom.
Neville's parents.
They suffered a fate worse
than death, you ask me.
It's been 14 years.
And still a day doesn't go
by I don't miss your dad.
Do you really think there's
going to be a war, Sirius?
It feels like it did before.
You keep it.
Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now.
I'll see you at the train.
Bye-bye, darling.
I love you.
Hold my hand, lovey.
There they are. They're in the far carriage.
Bye.
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.
Better enjoy it while you can.
I expect there's a cell in
Azkaban with your name on it.
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!
It's only Malfoy.
What'd you expect?
Hi, guys.
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.
What is it?
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.
It's pulling itself, like always.
You're not going mad.
I can see them too.
You're just as sane as I am.
Everyone, this is Loony Love...
Luna Lovegood.
What an interesting necklace.
It's a charm, actually.
Keeps away the Nargles.
Hungry.
I hope there's pudding.
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.
Good evening, children.
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...
...who'll be taking Care
of Magical Creatures...
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr.
Filch, has asked me to remind you...
She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.
Thank you, headmaster, for
those kind words of welcome.
And how lovely to see all your bright...
...happy faces smiling up at me.
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.
- That's likely.
- That's likely.
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.
Although each headmaster...
...has brought something new
to this historic school...
...progress for the sake of
progress must be discouraged.
Let us preserve what must be preserved...
...perfect what can be perfected...
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.
Dean, Seamus.
- Good holiday?
- All right.
Better than Seamus', anyway.
Me mum didn't want me to come back this year.
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.
The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.
What, your mum believes them?
Nobody was there the night Cedric died.
I guess you should read the Prophet,
then, like your stupid mother.
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.
Do you believe the rubbish he's
come out with about You-Know-Who?
Yeah. I do.
Has anyone else got a problem with Harry?
- You all right?
- Fine.
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.
Right. I'll just leave
you to your thoughts, then.
Harry.
Bring it over here. Over here.
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.
Good morning, children.
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.
O-W-Ls.
More commonly known as OWLs.
Study hard and you will be rewarded.
Fail to do so, and the
consequences may be severe.
Your previous instruction in this
subject has been disturbingly uneven.
But you'll be pleased to know, from now on...
...you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...
...course of defensive magic. Yes?
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?
Using spells?
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.
We're not gonna use magic?
You'll be learning about defensive
spells in a secure, risk-free way.
What use is that? If we're
attacked, it won't be risk-free.
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.
It is the view of the Ministry...
...that a theoretical
knowledge will be sufficient...
...to get you through your examinations...
...which, after all, is
what school is all about.
And how's theory supposed to
prepare us for what's out there?
There is nothing out there, dear.
Who do you imagine wants to
attack children like yourself?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.
Now, let me make this quite plain.
You have been told...
...that a certain dark
wizard is at large once again.
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.
Detention, Mr. Potter.
Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord?
Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.
Enough!
Enough.
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.
Come in.
Good evening, Mr. Potter.
Sit.
You're going to be doing some
lines for me today, Mr. Potter.
No, not with your quill.
Going to be using a
rather special one of mine.
Now...
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."
How many times?
Well, let's say for as long as it
takes for the message to sink in.
You haven't given me any ink.
Oh, you won't need any ink.
Yes?
- Nothing.
- That's right.
Because you know, deep down...
...you deserve to be punished.
Don't you, Mr. Potter?
Go on.
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.
Get out of class whenever you like.
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.
Care for another?
I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.
I'll do the introduction. That's all.
Hermione, you're honestly the most
wonderful person I've ever met.
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.
What's wrong with your hand?
Nothing.
The other hand.
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.
Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now.
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.
Bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you.
- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?
Harry, you've got to report this.
- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.
Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple.
You don't understand.
Then help us to.
Dear Padfoot...
...I hope you're all right.
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.
I know you, of all people, will understand.
Hello, Harry Potter.
- Your feet. Aren ' t they cold?
- Bit.
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.
I suspect Nargles are behind it.
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...
Different.
But why can't the others see them?
They can only be seen by
people who've seen death.
So you've known someone who's died, then?
My mum.
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...
...and one day, one of her
spells went badly wrong.
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.
Yes, it was rather horrible.
I do feel very sad about it
sometimes, but I've got Dad.
We both believe you, by the way.
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...
...and the Ministry and the
Prophet are conspiring against you.
Thanks. It seems you're
about the only ones that do.
I don't think that's true.
But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.
What do you mean?
Well, if I were
You-Know-Who...
...I'd want you to feel cut
off from everyone else...
...because if it's just you alone...
...you're not as much of a threat.
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.
Harry.
Can I join you?
Pardon me, professor, but what
exactly are you insinuating?
I am merely requesting that
when it comes to my students...
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.
So silly of me, but it sounds...
...as if you're questioning my
authority in my own classroom...
...Minerva.
Not at all, Dolores, merely
your medieval methods.
I am sorry, dear.
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...
...and by extension, the minister himself.
I am a tolerant woman...
...but the one thing I will
not stand for is disloyalty.
Disloyalty.
Things at Hogwarts are
far worse than I feared.
Cornelius will want to take immediate action.
What's happened to Dumbledore?
Having already revolutionized...
...the teaching of Defense
Against the Dark Arts...
...Dolores Umbridge will, as
high inquisitor, have powers...
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.
Just one question, dear.
You've been in this post how long, exactly?
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?
Yes.
But you were unsuccessful?
Obviously.
Could you please predict something for me?
I'm sorry?
Move those mouths.
One teensy little prophecy?
Pity.
No, wait. Wait, no. I
think I do see something.
Yes, I do. Something dark.
You are in grave danger.
Lovely.
Cho. What's going on?
It's Professor Trelawney.
Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.
Hogwarts is my home.
You can't do this.
Actually, I can.
Something you'd like to say?
Oh, there are several
things I would like to say.
There...
Professor McGonagall, might I ask
you to escort Sybil back inside?
Sybil, dear. This way.
Thank you.
Dumbledore, may I remind
you that under the terms...
...of Educational Decree Number
You have the right to dismiss my teachers.
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.
That power remains with the headmaster.
For now.
Don't you all have studying to do?
Professor.
Professor?
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!
Professor Dumbledore.
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.
We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.
She's taking over the entire school.
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.
Furthermore, we have convincing evidence...
...that these disappearances are the work...
...of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black.
Harry.
Sirius.
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.
You said you were worried about
Umbridge. What's she doing?
Training you to kill half-breeds?
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.
Combat?
What does he think, we're
forming some sort of wizard army?
That's exactly what he thinks.
That Dumbledore is assembling his
own forces to take on the Ministry.
He's becoming more paranoid by the minute.
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...
...but things aren't going
at all well with the Order.
Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn...
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.
Voldemort is on the move.
Well, what can we do?
Someone's coming.
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
But for now, at least, it
looks like you're on your own.
He really is out there, isn't he?
We've got to be able to defend ourselves.
And if Umbridge refuses to teach
us how, we need someone who will.
Harry.
This is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me?
I'm a nutter, remember?
Look on the bright side: you can't
be any worse than old toad face.
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?
Just a couple of people.
Lovely spot.
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.
Matey, come back here.
Hi.
So you all know why we're here.
We need a teacher.
A proper teacher.
One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.
- Why?
- Why?
Because You-Know-Who's
back, you tosspot.
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.
So Dumbledore says because he says.
The point is, where's the proof?
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.
Come on, Hermione. They're here because
they think I'm some sort of freak.
Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm?
Yes.
I've seen it.
Blimey, Harry. I didn't
know you could do that.
And he killed a basilisk, with
the sword in Dumbledore's office.
It's true.
Third year, he fought off about
a hundred Dementors at once.
Last year, he really did fight
off You-Know-Who in the flesh.
Wait.
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...
...but the truth is, most
of that was just luck.
I didn't know what I was doing half
the time. I nearly always had help.
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.
Facing this stuff in real
life is not like school.
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.
But out there...
...when you're a second
away from being murdered...
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...
You don't know what that's like.
You're right, Harry, we don't.
That's why we need your help.
Because if we're going to
have any chance at beating...
...Voldemort...
He's really back.
Right. First we need to
find a place to practice...
...where Umbridge won't find out.
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.
Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out?
Who cares?
I mean, it's sort of exciting,
isn't it, breaking the rules?
Who are you and what have
you done with Hermione?
Anyway, at least we know one
positive thing that came from today.
What's that?
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she?
Right. Over the next few
days, we should each come up...
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.
We've got to make sure, wherever it
is, there's no chance she can find us.
Will do, Harry.
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.
You've done it, Neville. You
found the Room of Requirement.
The what?
It's also known as the Come and Go Room.
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.
So say you really needed the toilet...
Charming, Ronald. But, yes,
that is the general idea.
It's brilliant. It's like
Hogwarts wants us to fight back.
Expelliarmus.
I'm hopeless.
You're just flourishing your wand too
much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.
You will please copy the
approved text four times...
...to ensure maximum retention.
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.
- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.
Stunning is one of the most
useful spells in your arsenal.
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.
Stupefy!
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.
Thanks, Ronald.
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.
- One Sickle.
- You're on.
Stupefy.
- Thank you.
- Shut up.
I let her do that. It's
good manners, isn't it?
It was completely intentional.
Up you come. Would you like a cup of tea?
Now, focus on a fixed point and try again.
Expelliarmus.
Very good. Keep your concentration.
Great.
A little higher.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
...may sign up in the
high inquisitor's office.
Diminuendo.
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:
Believing in yourself.
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.
Think of it this way.
Every great wizard in
history has started out...
...as nothing more than
what we are now: students.
If they can do it, why not us?
- Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Reducto.
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.
So that's it for this lesson.
Now, we' re not gonna be meeting
again until after the holidays.
So just keep practicing on
your own as best you can.
And well done, everyone. Great, great work.
Well done, mate.
Thanks.
See you after Christmas.
See you in the Common Room, Harry.
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...
Sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me?
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.
Yeah. I'm okay.
Anyway, it's worth it.
It's just, learning all this...
...makes me wonder
whether, if he'd known it...
Cedric did know this stuff.
He was really good.
It's just, Voldemort was better.
You're a really good teacher, Harry.
I've never been able to stun anything before.
Mistletoe.
Probably full of Nargles, though.
What are Nargles?
No idea.
Well, how was it?
Wet.
I mean, she was sort of crying.
That bad at it, are you?
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.
Cho spends half her time crying these days.
You'd think a bit of
snogging would cheer her up.
Don't you understand how she must be feeling?
Well, obviously she's
feeling sad about Cedric...
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.
One person couldn't feel
all that. They'd explode.
Just because you've got the
emotional range of a teaspoon...
Harry.
Voldemort may be after something.
Something he didn't have last time.
Harry.
Harry.
In the dream, were you
standing next to the victim...
...or looking down at the scene?
Neither. It was like I...
Will you please just tell me what's happening?
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.
Make sure he's found by the right people.
- Sir.
- Phineas.
You must go to your
portrait at Grimmauld Place.
Tell them that Arthur
Weasley is gravely injured...
...and his children will be
arriving there soon by Portkey.
They've got him, Albus. It was
close, but they think he'll make it.
What's more, the Dark
Lord failed to acquire it.
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...
Look at me!
What's happening to me?
You wished to see me, headmaster?
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't
wait. Not even till the morning.
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.
It appears there's a connection...
...between the Dark Lord's mind and your own.
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.
Pray he remains ignorant.
You mean, if he knows about it, then...
- ... he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...
...unhinge it.
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...
...to invade the minds of his victims...
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.
Only after extracting the last
exquisite ounce of agony...
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...
...kill them.
Used properly, the power of Occlumency...
...will help shield you
from access or influence.
In these lessons, I will
attempt to penetrate your mind.
You will attempt to resist.
Prepare yourself.
Legilimens.
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
Here we go.
Daddy's back.
Sit down, everybody, sit
down. That's it. Now, presents.
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...
Fred and George. Come on, open up.
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.
Oh, Harry, Harry.
There you are.
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?
Fred? George?
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.
To Mr. Harry Potter...
...without whom I would not be here.
- Harry.
- Harry.
Harry.
That is delicious. I shall
be needing some more of that.
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.
I can't understand why you
don't want to wear it, Ronald.
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.
No more than usual, Ron.
I don't know why...
Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass.
Harry Potter, the boy
who stopped the Dark Lord.
Friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike.
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!
That's enough of your bile. Away with you!
Of course, master.
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.
Sorry about that.
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.
Not to me, anyway.
What, you grew up here?
This is my parents' house.
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.
About the only useful
thing I've been able to do.
This is the Black family tree.
My deranged cousin.
I hated the lot of them.
My parents with their pure-blood mania.
My mother did that after I ran away.
Charming woman.
I was 16.
Where did you go?
Round your dad's.
I was always welcome at the Potters'.
I see him so much in you, Harry.
You are so very much alike.
I'm not so sure.
Sirius, when I was...
When I saw Mr. Weasley
attacked, I wasn't just watching.
I was the snake.
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...
...there was a moment when I wanted to...
This connection between me and Voldemort.
What if the reason for it is
that I am becoming more like him?
I just feel so angry all the time.
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...
...something's gone wrong inside
me? What if I'm becoming bad?
I want you to listen to
me very carefully, Harry.
You're not a bad person.
You're a very good person who
bad things have happened to.
You understand?
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.
We've all got both light
and dark inside of us.
What matters is the part we choose to act on.
That's who we really are.
Harry, time to go.
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.
You'll see.
Come on.
Really?
Harry. Harry.
Hagrid's back.
I'm sorry.
I will say this one last time.
I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been.
I told you. I've been away for me health.
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh
air must be difficult to come by.
If I were you, I shouldn't
get too used to being back.
In fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all.
This is top-secret, right?
Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants.
Giants?
You found them?
Well, they're not that hard to find, to
be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?
I tried to convince them to join the cause.
But I wasn't the only one that
was trying to win them over.
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.
Suppose some of them remember he
was friendly to them. I suppose.
And they did this to you?
Not exactly, no.
Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.
It's changing out there.
Just like last time.
There's a storm coming, Harry.
We'd all best be ready when she does.
We have confirmed that 10
high-security prisoners...
...in the early hours of
yesterday evening did escape.
And of course, the Muggle prime
minister has been alerted to the danger.
We strongly suspect...
...that the breakout was engineered...
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.
Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.
He's gonna get us all killed just
because he can't face the truth.
Harry.
I wanted to apologize.
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.
So, what I'm really trying
to say is that I believe you.
Neville?
Fourteen years ago...
...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange...
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.
She tortured them for information...
...but they never gave in.
I'm quite proud to be their son.
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.
We're gonna make them proud,
Neville. That's a promise.
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.
Allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus.
George, your turn now.
Expecto Patronum.
A full-bodied Patronus is the
most difficult to produce...
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.
Wow, that was really good.
Fantastic, Ginny.
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.
So focus, Luna.
Think of the happiest thing you can.
Expecto Patronum.
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.
This is really advanced stuff,
guys. You're doing so well.
Expecto Patronum.
I'll make short work of this.
Bombarda Maxima.
Get them.
Been watching them for weeks.
And see, " Dumbledore's Army"...
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...
...never fooled us for a minute.
We saw your lies for what they were:
A smokescreen for your bid to
seize control of the Ministry.
Naturally.
No, professor. He had nothing
to do with it. It was me.
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield
me, but as has been pointed out...
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."
I instructed Harry to form this organization.
And I, and I alone, am
responsible for its activities.
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.
If we hurry, we should still
make the morning edition.
Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you
will escort Dumbledore...
...to Azkaban...
...to await trial for conspiracy and sedition.
I thought we might hit this little snag.
You seem to be laboring under
the delusion that I'm going to...
What was the phrase?
...come quietly.
Well, I can tell you this:
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.
Enough of this.
Take him.
Well, you may not like him, minister...
...but you can't deny...
...Dumbledore has got style.
Boys and girls are not permitted to
be within eight inches of each other.
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
Harry.
You did everything you could. No
one could win against that old hag.
Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming.
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.
Yeah, we talked you into it.
Yeah, but I agreed.
I tried so hard to help, and all
it's done is make things worse.
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?
To go it alone.
Hagrid.
Any idea where he's taking us?
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.
And they're dangerous at the best of times.
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...
...they'll have a full
uprising on their hands.
Hagrid, what's going on?
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.
I wouldn't be bothering you at all
with it, but with Dumbledore gone...
...I'll likely be getting
the sack any day now.
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.
Grawpy.
Down here, you great buffoon.
Grawpy.
Brought you some company.
I couldn't just leave him, because...
Because he's my brother.
Blimey.
Well, half brother, really.
He's completely harmless, just like
I said. Little high-spirited, is all.
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.
We talked about this. You do not grab, do you?
That's your new friend, Hermione.
Grawpy.
Grawp.
Put me down.
Now.
You all right?
Fine.
Just needs a firm hand, is all.
I think you've got an admirer.
You just stay away from her, all right?
He gets his own food and all.
It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone.
You will look after him, won't you?
I'm the only family he's got.
Feeling sentimental?
- That's private.
- Not to me.
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.
Every memory he has access to is
a weapon he can use against you.
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.
You're just like your father.
Lazy, arrogant.
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.
Control your emotions.
Discipline your mind.
Legilimens.
Harry.
Sirius.
I may vomit.
Stop it.
Is this what you call control?
We've been at it for
hours. If I could just rest.
The Dark Lord isn't resting.
You and Black, you're two of a kind.
Sentimental children forever whining about
how bitterly unfair your lives have been.
Well, it may have escaped your
notice, but life isn't fair.
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.
- Legilimens.
- Protego.
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.
Snape. Expelliarmus.
Nice one, James.
- Dad.
- Impedimenta.
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
Enough.
Enough.
Your lessons are at an end.
I...
Get out.
- What's your name?
- Michael.
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?
It's fading already.
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...
...naughty children deserve to be punished.
You know, George...
...I've always felt our futures lay
outside the world of academic achievement.
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.
All right, professor!
Here you go.
Ready when you are.
I need that prophecy.
You'll have to kill me.
Oh, I will. But first,
you will fetch it for me.
Crucio.
Crucio.
Sirius.
Harry, are you sure?
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.
It's the door I've been dreaming about.
I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before.
Sirius said Voldemort was after something.
Something he didn't have the last
time, in the Department of Mysteries.
Harry, please, just listen.
What if Voldemort meant for you to see this?
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?
What if he is? I'm supposed
to just let him die?
Hermione, he's the only family I've got left.
What do we do?
We'll have to use the Floo Network.
Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance.
Not all of them.
Alohomora.
Alert the Order if you can.
- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.
When are you going to get it into
your head? We're in this together.
That you are.
Caught this one trying
to help the Weasley girl.
You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?
- No.
- Liar.
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.
Have you brought the Veritaserum?
I'm afraid you've used up all
my stores interrogating students.
The last of it on Miss Chang.
Unless you wish to poison him...
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.
...I cannot help you.
He's got Padfoot.
He's got Padfoot at the
place where it's hidden.
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?
What is he talking about, Snape?
No idea.
Very well.
You give me no choice, Potter.
As this is an issue of Ministry security...
...you leave me with...
...no alternative.
The Cruciatus Curse ought
to loosen your tongue.
That's illegal.
What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.
Tell her, Harry!
Tell me what?
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...
...I will.
Where what is?
Dumbledore's secret weapon.
How much further?
Not far.
It had to be somewhere students
wouldn't find it accidentally.
What are you doing?
Improvising.
Well?
Where is this weapon?
There isn't one, is there?
You were trying to trick me.
You know...
...I really hate children.
You have no business here,
centaur. This is a Ministry matter.
Lower your weapons.
I warn you, under the law, as
creatures of near-human intelligence...
Protego.
How dare you?
Filthy half-breed.
Incarcerous.
Please. Please stop it. Please.
Now, enough. I will have order.
You filthy animal.
Do you know who I am?
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.
No, he doesn't understand.
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.
I'm sorry, professor.
But I must not tell lies.
What are you doing?
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.
Let me go!
Thank you, Grawp.
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.
Told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets.
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.
That was clever, Ron.
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.
So how are we getting to London?
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...
...but I've got you into
enough trouble as it is.
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to
be about doing something real.
Or was that all just words to you?
Maybe you don't have to do
this all by yourself, mate.
So how are we going to get to London?
We fly, of course.
Department of Mysteries.
This is it.
Ninety-two.
Ninety-three.
Ninety-four.
Ninety-five.
- He should be here.
- Harry.
It's got your name on it.
The one with the power to
vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.
And the Dark Lord shall
mark him as his equal...
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.
For neither can live while the other survives.
Harry.
Where's Sirius?
You know, you really should learn to
tell the difference between dreams...
...and reality.
You saw only what the Dark
Lord wanted you to see.
Now, hand me the prophecy.
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.
He knows how to play.
Itty, bitty baby.
Potter.
Bellatrix Lestrange.
Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad?
Better, now they're about to be avenged.
Now, let's everybody just calm down...
...shall we?
All we want is that prophecy.
Why did Voldemort need
me to come and get this?
You dare speak his name?
You filthy half-blood!
It's all right. He's just
a curious lad, aren't you?
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.
Which is lucky for you, really.
Haven't you always wondered...
...what was the reason for the
connection between you and the Dark Lord?
Why he was unable to kill you...
...when you were just an infant?
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?
All the answers are there,
Potter, in your hand.
All you have to do...
...is give it to me.
Then I can show you everything.
I've waited 14 years.
I know.
I guess I can wait a
little longer. Now. Stupefy.
Stupefy.
Levicorpus.
Petrificus Totalus.
Well done, Neville.
Stupefy.
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.
Stupefy.
Reducto.
Get back to the door.
Department of Mysteries. They
got that bit right, didn't they?
The voices.
Can you tell what they're saying?
There aren't any voices, Harry.
Let's get out of here.
I hear them too.
Harry, it's just an empty archway.
Please, Harry.
Get behind me.
Did you actually believe...
...or were you truly naive enough to think...
...that children stood a chance against us?
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.
Give me the prophecy now...
...or watch your friends die.
Don't give it to him, Harry.
Get away from my godson.
Now, listen to me. Take the
others and get out of here.
What? No, I'm staying with you.
You've done beautifully.
Now, let me take it from here.
Black.
Expelliarmus!
Nice one, James.
Avada Kedavra.
No. No.
I killed Sirius Black.
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.
You've got to mean it, Harry.
She killed him. She deserves it.
You know the spell, Harry.
Do it.
So weak.
It was foolish of you to
come here tonight, T om.
The Aurors are on their way.
By which time I shall be gone, and you...
...shall be dead.
You've lost, old man.
Harry.
So weak.
So vulnerable.
Look at me.
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.
It's how you are not.
Harry?
You're the weak one...
...and you'll never know love or friendship.
And I feel sorry for you.
You're a fool, Harry Potter.
And you will lose everything.
He's back.
I know how you feel, Harry.
No, you don't.
It's my fault.
No, the fault is mine.
I knew it was only a matter of time...
...before Voldemort made
the connection between you.
I thought by distancing myself
from you, as I have done all year...
...he'd be less tempted, and
therefore you might be more protected.
The prophecy said:
"Neither one can live while
the other one survives."
It means one of us is gonna have
to kill the other, in the end.
Yes.
Why didn't you tell me?
For the same reason you tried to save Sirius.
The same reason your friends saved you.
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...
...I didn't want to cause you any more pain.
I cared too much about you.
How come you're not at the feast?
Lost all my possessions. Apparently
people have been hiding them.
That's awful.
Oh, it's all good fun.
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.
Do you want any help finding them?
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.
Are you sure you don't want any help looking?
That's all right.
Anyway, my mum always said...
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.
If not always in the way we expect.
Think I'll just go have some pudding.
I've been thinking about
something Dumbledore said to me.
What's that?
That even though we've
got a fight ahead of us...
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.
Yeah?
Something worth fighting for.
Millenium breaking disaster...
All river traffic has been halted and
police divers search for survivors.
Surrounding area
remains closed.
The man, known to...
Harry Potter.
Who's Harry Potter?
Um, no one.
Bit of a tosser, really.
Funny
that paper of yours.
Couple of minutes ago, I could have sworn
I saw a picture move.
Really?
While I was going
around the train.
- Okay, I was wondering--
- Eleven.
That's when
I get off.
You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.
You've been reckless
this summer, Harry.
I like riding around
the trains.
Takes my mind
off things.
All unpleasant to be old,
isn't it?
The tale is thrilling,
if I say so myself.
But now is not the time
to tell it.
Take my arm.
Do as I say.
I hardly just Apparated,
didn't I?
Indeed.
Quite successfully too,
I might add.
Most people vomit
the first time.
Can't imagine why.
Welcome to the charming village
of Budleigh Babberton.
Harry, I assume right about now
you must be wondering...
why I brought you here?
Am I right?
Actually sir, after all these years,
I just, sort of, go with it.
Wands on, Harry.
Horace!
Horace.
Merlin's beard!
You don't need
to disfigure me, Albus.
Well I must say you made
a very convincing armchair, Horace.
It's all
in the upholstery.
I come by this stuffing naturally.
What gave me away?
Dragon's blood.
Oh yes, introductions.
Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine--
Horace Slughorn.
Horace...
Well you know who this is.
Harry Potter.
So for love of theatrics,
Horace...
You're, by any chance,
waiting for someone else, were you?
Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
Alright. The Death Eaters
have been trying
to recruit me
for over a year.
Do you know
what's that like?
You can only say no
to these people so many times.
So I never stay anywhere
more than a week.
The Muggles who own this place
are in the Canary Islands.
Well, I think we should put it
back in order for them,
- don't you?
- Yes.
Fine.
That was fun.
Do you mind
if I use the loo?
No, of course.
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.
The answer is still no.
Absolutely,
and unequivanetly, no.
You're very like
your father.
Except the eyes,
of course.
- You have your--
- My mother's eyes, yeah.
Lily, lovely Lily.
She's exceedingly bright,
your mother.
Even more impressive
even though I could say
that she was Muggle-born.
One of my best friends
is Muggle-born.
- She's the best in our year.
- Oh please don't think
I'm prejudiced.
No, no, no.
Your mother was
one of my absolute favorites.
Look, there she is.
Right at the front.
All mine.
Each and every one.
Ex-students, I mean.
You recognise Barnabas Cuffe?
Editor of the Daily Prophet.
Always takes my owl
should I wish to register an opinion
on the news of the day.
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.
Free tickets
whenever I want them.
Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.
Ah, yes!
Regulus Black.
No doubt, there is
his older brother Sirius,
died a few weeks ago.
I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.
It's a shame.
A talented boy.
I got Regulus when
he came along, of course, but...
but I'd like to set.
Horace!
Do you mind if I take this?
I do love
knitting patterns.
Yes, of course,
but you're not leaving, are you?
Oh, I think I know
a lost cause when I see one.
Regrettable, I would have considered it
a very personal triumph
if you consented
to return to Hogwarts.
Ah well, you're like my friend
Mr. Potter here.
One of a kind.
Well, bye-bye Horace.
Bye.
Alright. I'll do it.
But I want Professor Merrythought's
old office,
not the water closet
I had before.
And I expect a raise.
These are mad times
we're living, mad!
They are, indeed.
Sir, exactly what was
all that about?
You are talented,
famous and powerful.
Everything Horace values.
Professor Slughorn's gonna try
to collect you, Harry.
You would be
his crowning jewel.
That's why
he's returning to Hogwarts.
And it's crucial
he should return.
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.
She was truthfully...
very pretty.
The girl.
It's alright, sir.
I'll go back tomorrow,
make some excuse.
Oh you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.
But sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?
Both
are waiting for you.
Hedwig?
Mom?
Ginny, what is it?
I was only wondering
when Harry got here.
What?
Harry-- Harry, who?
Harry Potter, of course.
I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?
His trunk's in the kitchen...
and his owl.
But no, dear.
I seriously doubt that.
Harry?
Did someone say Harry?
Me, nosey.
Is he up there with you?
Of course not.
I think I'll know if my best friend's
in my room, wouldn't I?
Is that an owl I heard?
You haven't seen him,
have you?
Apparently, he's wandering
about the house.
- Really?
- Really.
Harry!
Harry.
What a lovely surprise!
Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?
I didn't know.
Dumbledore.
Oh, that man!
What we won't do without him?
A bit of... toothpaste.
So when did you
get here?
A few days ago.
Day or for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.
Mum...
sort of lost it, last week.
Said Ginny and I have
no business going back to Hogwarts.
It's too dangerous.
Oh, come on.
She's not alone.
Even my parents.
They're Muggles,
know something
bad's happening.
Anyway,
Dad stepped in.
Told us she was
being barmy and...
Took a few days,
but she came around.
But, this is Hogwarts
we're talking about.
It's Dumbledore.
What could be safer?
There's been a lot of talk
recently that...
Dumbledore's
got a bit old.
What rubbish!
Well, he's only...
How old is he?
Give or take a few years?
Cissy, you can't do this!
He can't be trusted.
The Dark Lord trusts him.
The Dark Lord is mistaken.
Run along, Wormtail.
I-I know
I ought not to be here.
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you would not to speak.
Put it down, Bella, we mustn't
touch what isn't ours.
As it, so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.
You?
The Dark Lord told you?
Your sister darts me.
Understandable, over the years,
I've played my part well.
So well, I've deceived one of
the greatest wizards of all time.
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.
I don't doubt you, Severus.
You should be honored,
Cissy.
As should Draco.
He's just a boy.
I can't change
the Dark Lord's mind.
But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.
Severus.
Swear to it.
Make the Unbreakable Vow.
It's just empty words.
You'll give it his best effort...
when it matters most.
He'll just slither back
to his hole.
Coward.
Take out your wand.
Will you, Severus Snape,
watch over Draco Malfoy
as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?
I will.
And will you,
to the best of your ability,
protect him from harm?
I will.
And if Draco should fail,
will you yourself
carry out the deed
the Dark Lord has ordered
Draco to perform?
I will.
Step up, step up!
We got fating fancies.
- And he's made me go.
- At just in for time for school.
Puking Pastilles.
Meeting's in the cauldron,
Hanson.
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
- How real many spinned it at that one?
Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.
Hello, ladies.
Love potions, eh?
Yeah.
They really do work.
Then again the way
we heard you, sis...
You're doing just fine
on your own.
Meaning?
Are you not currently dating
Dean Thomas?
It's none of your business.
How much for this?
- Five galleons.
- Five galleons.
How much for me?
- Five galleons.
- Five galleons.
I'm your brother.
- Ten galleons.
- Ten galleons.
Come on, let's go.
Hi, Ron.
Hi.
How are Fred and George
doing it?
Half the alley's
closed down.
Fred reckons people
need a laugh these days.
I reckon he's right.
Oh, no.
Everyone got their wands
from Ollivanders.
Harry...
Is it me
or do Draco and Mummy
look like two people who
don't want to be followed?
Quibbler!
Quibbler.
He's lovely.
They've been known to sing
at Boxing Day, you know?
- Quibbler?
- Oh, please.
What's a Wrackspurt?
Invisible creatures,
they flow in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.
Quibbler!
So what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?
And who were
all those people?
Don't you see?
It was a ceremony.
- An initiation.
- Stop it, Harry.
- I know where you're going with this.
- It happened.
- He's one of them.
- One of who?
Harry's under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
You're barking.
What would You-Know-Who want
with a sod like Malfoy?
Oh, then what's he doing
in Borgin and Burkes?
Browsing for furniture?
It's a creepy shop.
He's a creepy blood.
Blood? His father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.
Besides, Hermione saw it
with her own eyes.
I told you,
I don't know what I saw.
I need some air.
- What's going on?
- What's in that?
What's that?
What is it?
- I don't know.
- What was that?
Relax, boys. It's probably just
a phantom messing around.
Come, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.
Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.
I think I pitched myself
off the astronomy tab
I thought I had to continue
for another 2 years.
What's that supposed
to mean?
Let's just say I don't think
I see me wasting my time
in Charms class
next year.
Amused, Blaise?
Let's see just
who's laughing in the end.
You two go on.
Wanna check something.
- Where's Harry?
- He's probably on the platform.
Come on.
Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?
Petrificus Totalus!
Oh yeah...
She was dead before you could
wipe the drool off your chin.
That's for my father.
Enjoy your ride
back to London.
Ennervate!
Hello, Harry!
Luna.
How'd you know where I was?
Wrapspurts,
your head's full of them.
Sorry I made you miss the carriages,
by the way, Luna.
That's alright.
It was like being with a friend.
Well,
I am your friend, Luna.
That's nice.
Oh, about time.
I've been looking
all over for you two.
Right...
Names?
Professor Flitwick,
you know me for five years.
No exceptions, Potter.
- Who are those people?
- Aurors.
Security.
What's this cane here then?
It's not a cane, you cretin.
It's a walking stick.
And what exactly will
you be doing with all...
be construed
as an offensive weapon.
It's alright, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.
Nice face, Potter.
Would you like me
to fix it for you?
Personally, I think
you look a bit more...
devil may care
this way but...
It's up to you.
Well, have you ever
fixed a nose before?
No, but I've done
several toes...
How different
are they really?
Um, okay, yeah.
Give it a go.
Episkey!
- How do I look?
- Exceptionally ordinary.
Brilliant!
Hermione...
I'm here in a minute.
Will you stop eating?
Your best friend is missing.
Why won't you
turn around, you lunatic?
He's covered in blood again.
Why is it
he's always covered in blood?
Looks like it's his own
this time.
Where have you been?
What happened to your face?
Later.
What did I miss?
The Sorting Hat says we ought to be
brave and strong in these trouble times.
Easy for it to say, though.
It's a hat, isn't it?
- Very best of evenings to you all.
- Thanks.
First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff.
Horace Slughorn.
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say,
has agreed to resume his old post...
as Potions Master.
Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...
will be taken by
Professor Snape.
As you know,
each and every one of you
were searched
upon your arrival here tonight.
And you have the right
to know why.
Once,
there was a young man.
Like you,
sat in this very hall.
Walked this castle's corridors.
Slept under it's roof.
You see, to all the world,
a student like any other.
His name:
Tom Riddle.
Today of course, is known
all over the world by another name.
Which is why
as I stand,
looking out
upon you all tonight,
I'm reminded
of a sobering fact.
Every day, every hour,
this very minute, perhaps...
dark forces attempt
to penetrate this castle's walls.
But in the end,
that greatest weapon...
is you.
Just something
to think about.
Now off to bed,
beep beep.
That was cheerful.
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.
Mr. Davis, Mr. Davis,
that is the girls' lavatory.
Potter.
Oh, this can't be good.
Enjoying ourselves,
are we?
I had a free period
this morning, Professor.
So I noticed.
I would think you would want
to fill it with Potions.
Or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?
Well, it was, but I was told to have
to get an Outstanding in my O.W.L.
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.
However, Professor Slughorn's
perfectly happy
to accept N.E.W.T. students
with "Exceeds Expectations".
Brilliant, um...
Well, I'll head there straight away.
Oh, good, good.
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.
I don't want
to take Potions.
There's Quidditch trials coming up,
I need to practice.
Attention to detail in the preparation
is the prerequisite of all plan.
Harry, my boy,
I've been beginning to worry.
You brought someone
with us, I see.
Ron Weasley, sir.
But I'm dead awful at Potions.
A menace, actually so.
I'm probably just gonna--
Nonsense,
we'll sort you out.
Any friend of Harry's
is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.
I'm sorry, sir, I haven't actually
got my book yet and nor is Ron.
Not to worry,
get what you want from the cupboard.
Now as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions
this morning.
Any ideas
what these might be?
- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.
That one there is
Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.
And that one--
It's terribly tricky to make.
This is Amortentia.
The most powerful
love potion in the world.
It's rumored to smell differently
to each person
according to
what attracts them.
For example, I smell...
Freshly mown grass
and new parchment and...
Spearmint toothpaste.
Now Amortentia
doesn't create actual love.
That would be impossible,
but it does cause
powerful infatuation or obsession.
And for that reason,
it is probably the most
dangerous potion in this room.
Sir, you haven't told us
what's in that one.
Oh yes. What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen,
is a curious little potion,
known as Felix Felicis.
But it is more commonly known
referred to as--
- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger.
Liquid luck.
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.
One sip and you'll find
that all of your endeavours succeed.
At least
until the effects wear off.
So this is what I offer
each of you today.
One tiny vial of liquid luck
to the student
who in the hour that remains,
manages to brew
an acceptable
Draught of Living Dead.
Recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.
Issue one doubt, however.
Only one set of student
manage to brew a potion
of sufficient quality
to claim this prize.
Nevertheless,
good luck to you all.
Let the brewing commence.
How did you do that?
You crush it,
don't cut it.
No, the instructions
specifically says to cut.
No, really.
Merlin's beard!
It is perfect!
So perfect I'd just say
one drop would kill us all!
Here we are then,
as promised.
One vial of Felix Felicis.
Congratulations.
Use it well.
Oh Harry,
you got my message?
Come in.
How are you?
I'm fine, sir.
Enjoying your classes?
I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.
I think he overestimates
my abilities, sir.
Do you?
Definitely.
What about your activities
outside the classroom?
Sir?
Well, I notice you've spent
a great deal of time with Miss Granger.
I can't help wondering if--
Oh, no, no, I mean...
She's brilliant
and we're friends.
- But no.
- Forgive me.
I was only being curious.
But enough chit-chat.
You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.
The answer lies here.
What you're looking at
are memories.
In this case,
pertaining to one individual:
Voldemort.
Or as he was known, then:
Tom Riddle.
This vial contains
the most sufficient memory.
On the day
I first met him.
I'd like you to see it.
If you want.
I'm to admit to some confusion for
receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.
In all the years Tom's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.
There have been incidents
with the other children--
Nasty things.
Tom, you have a visitor.
How'd you do, Tom?
Don't.
You're the doctor,
aren't you?
No, I'm a professor.
I don't believe you.
She wants me
looked at.
They think I'm...
different.
Or perhaps they're right.
I'm not mad.
Hogwarts is not a place
for mad people.
Hogwarts is a school.
School of magic.
You can do things,
can't you, Tom?
Things other children can't.
I can make things move
without touching them.
I can make animals do
what I want without training them.
I can make bad things happen
to people who mean to me.
Can make them hurt.
If I want.
Who are you?
Well, I'm like you, Tom.
I'm different.
Prove it.
I think there's something
in your wardrobe
trying to get out, Tom.
Thievery is not tolerated
at Hogwarts, Tom.
At Hogwarts, we'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.
You understand me?
I can speak to snakes too.
They find me.
Whisper things.
Is that normal for someone like me?
Did you know, sir,
then?
Did I know I just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time?
No.
If I had, I...
Over time
while here at Hogwarts,
Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.
Can you guess
who that teacher might be?
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach potions, did you, sir?
No, I did not.
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something that I desire very dearly.
He will not
give it out easily.
You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect to me.
I did.
Do you want me
to let him?
Yes.
Okay,
so this morning,
I'm gonna be putting you all
for a few drills
just to assess you
straight.
Quiet, please!
Shut it!
Thanks.
Alright, um,
now then, remember,
just because you made
the team last year
does not guarantee you
a spot this year.
Is that clear?
Good.
No hard feelings, Weasley,
alright?
Hard feelings?
Yeah, I'll be going out
for Keeper's, well,
It's...
nothing personal.
Really?
Such a big guy like you?
You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?
Keepers need
to be quick, agile.
I'll have my chances.
Say, um, you think you could
introduce me to your friend, Granger?
Wouldn't mind, eh,
getting on a first-hand base,
you know
what I mean?
Come on, come on.
Go, Cormac.
Come on, Ron!
Come on, Ron.
Confundus.
He's brilliant.
I have to admit I thought
I was going to miss that last one.
I hope Cormac's
not taking it too hard.
He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione-- Cormac.
He's vile.
Have you ever heard of the spell:
Sectumsempra?
No, I haven't.
If you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.
Not bloody likely.
He's top of the class.
He's even better than you, Hermione.
Slughorn thinks
he's a genius.
I'd like to know
who's that book was.
- Let's have a look, shall we?
- No.
Why not?
The binding is fragile.
"The binding is fragile"?
Yeah.
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
- Who?
That's what it says
right here.
This book is property
of the Half-Blood Prince.
For weeks,
you carry around this book.
Practically, sleep with it,
and yet you have no desire
to find out
who the Half-Blood Prince is.
I didn't say I wasn't curious
and I don't sleep with it.
Well, it's true.
Well, I got a nice chat
before I go to bed.
And all you do is that bloody book.
It's like being with Hermione.
Well, I was curious
So, I went to--
- The library?
- The library?
And?
And nothing.
I couldn't find a reference
anywhere
to the Half-Blood Prince.
There we go.
That settles it, then.
Yeah, uh...
hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks.
Uh no, emergency choir practice
from the freighthorse.
Does anyone fancy
a butterbeer?
A chum of mine
was sledging down Clagsby Hill.
We had a very long, home-made
Norwegian style sledge.
We hurtled down,
we hit what most...
Ron, sit aside me.
Okay.
Something to drink?
Three butterbeers
and some ginger in mine, please.
Oh, bloody hell.
Ron, see they're only
holding hands.
And snogging.
- I'd like to leave.
- What?
You can't be serious.
- That happens to be my sister.
- So?
What if she looked at me
and saw you snogging me?
Would you expect her
to get up and leave?
- Hey, my boy.
- So wonderful to see you.
And you, and you.
So what brings you here?
Oh, Three Broomsticks and I go way back
further than I care to admit.
I could remember
when it was One Broomstick.
All hands on deck, Granger.
Listen, my boy,
in the old days, I used to throw together
the occassional supper party.
Select a student
or two.
Would you be game?
I consider it
an honor, sir.
You'd be welcome too,
Granger.
- I'd be delighted, sir.
- Splendid!
Look for my owl.
Good to see you, Wallenby.
What are you playing at?
Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.
- Get to know him?
- Dunno.
It must be important.
If it wasn't,
Dumbledore wouldn't ask.
You got a little bit...
Katie, we don't know
what it could be.
- Harry, what...
- I know what I'm doing.
Did you hear
what she was saying
back in the pub there
on me and her snogging?
I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.
Don't get any closer!
Get back, all of you.
Oh no, no, no.
Do not touch that,
except for the wrappings.
Do you understand?
You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession
when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?
It's like I said.
She left to go to the loo.
And when she came back,
she had the package.
She said it was important
that she deliver it.
- Did she say to whom?
- To Professor Dumbledore.
Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.
Why is it
when something happens,
it is always you three?
Believe me, Professor,
I've been asking myself
the same question for six years.
Oh, Severus.
What do you think?
I think Ms. Bell
is lucky to be alive.
She was cursed,
wasn't she?
I know Katie.
Off the Quidditch pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.
If she was delivering that
to Professor Dumbledore,
she wasn't doing it
knowingly.
Yes, she was cursed.
It was Malfoy.
That is a very
serious accusation, Potter.
Indeed.
Your evidence?
I just know.
You "just" know.
Once again, you're astonished
with your gifts, Potter.
Gifts mere mortals can only
dream of possessing.
How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.
I suggest you go back
to your dormitories.
All of you.
What do you suppose
Dean sees in her-- Ginny?
And what does
she see in him?
Dean--
He's brilliant.
You called him slick git
not five hours ago.
Yeah, well, he was running
his hands all over my sister,
wasn't he?
Something snaps.
You've got to hate him, you know?
Old principle.
I suppose.
So what do you think
he sees in her?
I don't know.
She's smart,
funny, attractive--
Attractive?
You know,
she's got nice skin.
Skin? You're saying Dean's
dating my sister because of her skin?
For blood, I mean.
I'm just--I'm just saying
it could be
a contributing factor.
Hermione's got nice skin.
When you say it,
as skin goes, I mean.
I've never really
thought about it.
But I suppose, yeah.
Very nice.
I think
I'll be going to sleep now.
Right.
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your uncle Tiberius these days?
Yes, sir, in fact I'm meant
to get hunting with him
and the Minister of Magic
over the holidays.
Oh, well, be sure
to give them both my best.
And what about
your uncle, Belby?
For those of you
who don't know well,
Marcus' uncle invented
the Wolfsbane Potion.
Is he working
on anything new?
I don't know.
He and my dad
don't get along.
'Prolly cause my dad
says potions are rubbish.
His only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.
And what about you,
Ms. Granger,
what exactly does your family do
in the Muggle world?
My parents are dentists.
They attend to people's teeth.
Fascinating.
And is that considered
a dangerous profession?
No.
Although, one boy, Robby Fenwich,
did bite my father once.
He needed ten stitches.
Ah, Ms. Weasley.
Come in, come in.
Look, her eyes.
They've been fighting again.
Her and Dean.
Sorry,
I'm not usually late.
No matter,
just in time for dessert.
That is if Belby
has left you any.
- What?
- Nothing.
Goodbye.
Bye-bye.
Potter!
I'm sorry, sir, I was
just admiring your hourglass.
Ah yes,
most intriguing object.
The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.
It is stimulating,
the sand runs slowly.
- If it is not...
- I think I'll be going, then.
Nonsense.
You have nothing
to fear, dear boy.
Actually,
some of your classmates...
Well, let's just say
they're unlikely to make the shelf.
Shelf, sir?
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.
But then again, you already
are someone, aren't you, Harry?
Did Voldemort
ever make the shelf, sir?
You knew him, didn't you, sir?
Tom Riddle?
You were his teacher.
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
who was here at Hogwarts.
What was he like?
I'm sorry, sir.
Forgive me.
He killed my parents.
Of course, it's only natural
you should want to know more.
But I'm afraid
I must disappoint you, Harry.
When I first met
young Mr. Riddle,
he was a quiet,
albeit brilliant boy,
committed to becoming
a first-grade wizard.
Not unlike
others I've known.
Not unlike yourself,
in fact.
If the monster existed,
it was very deep within.
You okay, Ron?
I'm counting on you, Ron.
I've 2 games on Gryffindor, ya?
- Be good, Ron.
- Loser!
What's he wearing?
- So how was it, then?
- How is what?
- Your dinner party?
- Pretty boring actually.
But I think
Harry enjoyed dessert.
Slughorn's having Christmas,
do you know?
I'm about to bring someone.
I expect
you'll be bringing McLaggen.
He's in the Slug Club,
isn't he?
Actually,
I was going to ask you.
Really?
Good luck today, Ron.
I know
you'll be brilliant.
I'm resigning.
After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.
Are you alright?
- Juice?
- Sure.
Hello, everyone.
You look dreadful, Ron.
Is that why you put
something in his cup?
Is it a tonic?
Liquid luck.
Don't drink it, Ron.
- You could be expelled for that.
- What are we talking about?
Come on, Harry,
we've got a game to win.
- Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
- Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
You shouldn't
have done it.
I know. I supposed I could have just
used the Confundus charm.
That was different.
That was try-outs,
this was a natural game.
You didn't put in?
Ron only thought
you did.
Charm spell.
Just practising.
Very good.
How does it feel, Harry?
When you see
Dean with Ginny?
I know.
I see the way
you look at her.
You're my best friend.
Oops! I think
this room's taken.
What's with the birds?
Oppugno.
It feels like this.
I can't help it if
she's got her knickers in a twist.
What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say,
there's no stopping it.
It's chemical.
Will it last?
Who knows?
Point is
I'm a free agent.
He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whomever he likes.
I really couldn't
care less.
Was I
under the impression
he and I would be attending
Slughorn's Christmas party together?
Yes. Now,
given the circumstances,
I had to make
other arrangements.
- Have you?
- Yes.
Why?
Well, I just thought
seeing is not the risk at going
with who
we'd really like to,
We should go together,
as friends.
Why didn't
I think of that?
Who are you going with?
Um, it's a surprise.
Anyways, you have got to worry about.
You can't take anyone.
You see that girl
over there?
That's Romilda Vane.
Harry, she's been been trying
to smuggle you a love potion.
Really?
Hey!
She's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the Chosen One.
But I am
the Chosen One.
Okay, sorry, um...
Kidding.
I'll ask someone I like.
Someone cool.
I've never been
to this part of the castle.
At least,
not while awake.
I sleep-walk, you see.
That's why
I wear shoes to bed.
Harmonia nictere passus.
Harmonia nictere passus.
Harmonia nictere passus.
Drink?
Neville.
I didn't get
into the Slug Club.
It's okay, though.
He's got Melvin hanging up
towels in the looroom.
I'm--I'm fine, mate.
Thanks.
Okay.
Hermione,
what are you doing?
What happened to you?
No, I've just escaped.
I mean, I left Cormac
under the mistletoe.
Cormac?
That's who you invited?
I thought it would
annoy Ron the most.
Thank you very much.
We will catch up with you.
He's got more tentacles
than a Snargaluff plant.
- Dragon tails?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
Just this one.
They give one horribly bad breath.
On second thoughts,
it might keep Cormac away.
God, here he comes.
I think she just went
to paddle her nose.
She's a little minx,
your friend.
Nice to work.
How nasty isn't she?
Yeah, yeah,
yeah.
What is this I'm eating,
by the way?
Dragon balls.
You've just brought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.
Not so quick, Potter.
Sir, I really think I should
rejoin the party. My date--
Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.
Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.
- Message?
- From Professor Dumbledore.
He asked me to give you his best
and he hopes you enjoy your holidays.
He...
He's travelling.
And he won't return
until term resumes.
Travelling where?
How are you?
Get your hands off me,
you filthy Squibb.
Professor Slughorn, sir.
I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.
He claims to have been
invited to your party.
Okay, okay,
I was gate-crashing.
Happy?
I'll escort him out.
Certainly, Professor.
Alright, everyone carry on,
carry on.
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn't.
What about you?
I swore to protect you.
I made the Unbreakable Vow.
I don't need protection.
I was chosen
for this.
I don't know
what all this mean,
- but I won't fail him.
- You're afraid, Draco.
You attempt to consider,
but it's obvious,
- let me assist you.
- No.
I was chosen.
This is my moment.
Unbreakable Vow.
You sure that's what Snape said?
Positive. Why?
It's just, you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.
I-I worked that much out
for myself, funny enough.
I don't understand.
Oh bloody hell.
I miss you.
Lovely.
All she wants to do
is snog me.
My lips
are getting chapped, look.
Then I'll take
your word for it.
So what happens
to you?
What happens
if you break an Unbreakable Vow?
You die.
Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?
- I know it sounds mad.
- Has it occured to you, Harry,
that Snape was simply pretending
to offer Draco help
so he could find out
what he was up to?
Ginny!
That's not
what it sounded like.
Perhaps Harry
is right, Remus.
I mean, to make
an Unbreakable Vow--
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgement.
Dumbledore trusts Snape,
therefore, I do.
Dumbledore
can make mistakes.
- He said so himself.
- You are blinded by hatred.
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
People are disappearing,
Harry. Daily.
We could only place our trust
in a handful of people.
If we started fighting
amongst ourselves,
we're doomed.
Ginny!
Open up, you.
Don't you trust me?
It's good.
Just, uh, get...
- Pie?
- Not for me. No.
You'll have to forgive
Remus.
It takes its toll,
his condition.
Are you alright,
Mr. Weasley?
We're being followed,
all of us.
Most days, Molly doesn't
leave the house.
It's not been easy.
Did you get my owl?
Yes, I did.
If Dumbledore is traveling,
then perhaps news to the Ministry,
but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.
As for Draco Malfoy...
I know a bit more.
- Go on.
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.
I think from
what you described...
What you and Ron
saw at the end of summer,
the object that Draco
is so interested in,
is a Vanishing Cabinet.
A "Vanishing Cabinet"?
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.
You can see the appeal.
Should the Death Eaters
come knocking,
one simply have to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.
It transports you
practically anywhere.
Tricky contraptions, though.
Very temperamental.
What happened to it?
The one
at Borgin and Burkes?
Nothing.
It's still there.
It was delicious,
Molly, really.
Are you sure
you won't stay?
No, we should go.
The first night of the cycle's
always the worst.
Remus?
Sweetheart.
Has Ron
gone to bed?
Um, not yet. No.
Shoelace...
Merry Christmas, Harry.
Merry Christmas.
- Harry, no!
- Harry! Remus.
Ginny!
I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!
You coming to get me?
Get me!
He's trying to get me!
Harry?
Stupefy!
Harry!
Ginny!
Molly.
It's so easy for them
to get to you.
You're bloody lucky
you weren't killed.
You have to realise
who you are, Harry!
I know who I am,
Hermione, alright.
Sorry.
Hon, go somewhere.
That's my Won-Won.
Excuse me,
I have to go and vomit.
...Always you ruin
half the start.
Sir, is it true that
Professor Merrythought is retiring?
Tom, I couldn't tell you
if I knew, could I?
And by the way,
thank you for the pineapple.
You're quite right.
It is my favorite.
But how did you know?
Intuition.
Good gracious,
is it that time already?
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett
will have us all in detention.
Look sharp, Tom.
Don't be caught
out of bed after hours.
Is something
on your mind, Tom?
Yes, sir.
See, I couldnt think of
anyone else to go to.
The other professors...
Well, they're not like you.
They might
misunderstand.
Go on.
I was in the library
the other night.
In the restricted section.
And I picked something
rather odd about this rare magic.
I thought perhaps,
you could illuminate me.
It's called, as I understand it,
Hor...
I beg your pardon?
I don't know anything about such things
and if I did,
I wouldn't tell you.
Now get out of here
at once
and dont let me ever catch you
mentioning them again!
Confused?
I'd be surprised if you weren't.
I don't understand.
What happened?
This is perhaps the most important
memory I had collected.
It is also a lie.
This memory has been tempered with
by the same person whose memory it is.
Our old friend,
Professor Slughorn.
But why would he temper
with his own memory?
I suspect
he's ashamed of it.
Why?
Why, indeed.
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn
and you had done so.
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory.
Any way you can.
I don't know him
that well, sir.
This memory is everything.
Without it, we are blind.
Without it, we leave
the fate of our world to chance.
You have no choice.
You must not fail.
I highly recommend,
reacquaint yourself
with the chapter
on antidotes.
Now, I'll tell you more about
bezoars in our next class.
Right, off you go.
Elise, don't forget your rat tail.
Aha! It isn't
the Prince of Potions himself!
What do I owe
this pleasure?
Oh, sir, I wondered
if I wanted to ask you something.
Ask away, dear boy.
Ask away.
Well, you see the other day,
I was in the library
in the restricted section,
and I came across something
rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.
Yes, what was
this rare piece of magic?
Well, I don't know,
but I can't remember the name exactly.
But it just got me wondering,
are there some kinds of magic
you're not allowed
to teach us?
I'm Potions Master,
Harry,
I think your question better be
posed to Professor Snape.
Yes, he and I don't
exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.
What I mean
to say is...
Well, he's not like you.
He might misunderstand.
Yes, it would be no light
without the dark.
And so
it is with magic,
myself I always strive
to live within the light.
I suggest
you do the same.
Is that what you told Tom Riddle, sir,
when he came asking questions?
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?
Didn't he?
Yes?
Oh, it's you, Potter.
I-I'm sorry,
I'm busy at the moment.
That's beautiful,
isn't it?
The moon.
Divine.
Had ourselves a little
late night snack, did we?
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.
Or twenty?
I can't stop
thinking about her, Harry.
Honestly, you know, I reckon
she was starting to annoy you.
She could never annoy me.
I think I love her.
Well, brilliant.
Do you think
she knows I exist?
I very well hope so.
She's been snogging you
for three months.
Snogging?
Who are you talking about?
Who are you talking about?
Romilda, of course.
Romilda Vane.
Okay, very funny.
What was that for?
It's no joke.
- I'm in love with her!
- Alright, fine.
You're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?
No.
Can you introduce me?
Come on, Ron.
I will introduce you to Romilda Vane.
I'm sorry, sir.
I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.
- Where's Romilda?
- What's the matter with Wimby?
Very powerful love potion.
Very well,
better bring him in.
I always thought you could whip up
a remedy for this is in no time, Harry.
Well, I-I thought this called
for more practised hands, sir.
Hello, darling.
Fancy a drink?
Perhaps, you're right.
I'm sorry, by the way, Professor,
about earlier today.
Our misunderstanding.
Oh, not at all.
Old water under the bridge, you know.
Correct?
Well, I expect you're tired a bit,
after all these years.
And the questions
about Voldemort.
Don't use that name!
Here you go, boy.
Bottom's up.
- What's this?
- Tonic for the nerves.
What happened to me?
- A love potion.
- A bloody strong one at there.
- I feel really bad.
- You need to pick me up, my boy.
Got butterbeer, wine,
dazzling oak-matured mead.
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances.
Here you are, Potter.
To life!
Ron!
Ron!
Professor, do something.
I-I don't understand!
Come on, Ron,
breathe!
These girls...
They're gonna kill me.
Quick thinking on your part,
Harry, using a bezoar.
You should be very proud
of your student, Horace.
Ah, yes.
Very proud.
I think we agree
Potter's actions were heroic.
The question is:
Why were they necessary?
I, indeed.
This appears to be a gift,
Horace.
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?
By the way,
it possesses remarkably
subtle hints
of liquorice and cherry.
When not polluted
with poison.
Actually, I had intended
to give it as a gift, myself.
To whom,
might I ask?
To you, headmaster.
Where is he?
Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been
asking for me?
What's she doing here?
I might ask you
the same question.
I happen to be
his girlfriend.
And I happen to be his...
friend.
Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken
in weeks.
I suppose you want
to make up with him
now that he's suddenly
all interesting.
He's been poisoned,
you daft dimbo!
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.
See?
He senses my presence.
Don't worry, Won-Won.
I'm here.
I'm here.
Hermione.
Hermione.
Hermione.
Oh to be young
and to feel love's keen sting.
Well, come over,
everybody.
Mr. Weasley's well attended.
About time,
don't you think?
Thank you.
Just shut up.
Stop it, Ron.
You're making it snow.
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.
Well, she came to visit you
in the hospital.
And you talked.
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her's.
She seems a bit...
put out.
Yes, um...
She does, isn't she?
You say you don't remember
anything from that night.
Anything at all?
There is something.
It can't be.
I was completely boggled,
didn't I?
Boggled.
Harry...
That's Katie.
Katie Bell.
Katie,
how are you?
I know you're going
to ask, Harry.
But I don't know
who cursed me.
I've been trying
to remember. Honestly.
But I just can't.
Katie.
I know what you did,
Malfoy.
You hexed it,
didn't you?
Sectumsempra!
You have
to get rid of it.
Today.
Take my hand.
It's the Room of Requirement.
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book.
Where no one'll ever find it.
Including you.
- What was that?
- What was that?
See, you never know
what you'll find up here.
Alright, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.
Close your eyes.
S u B:
V e R d i K
That can stay hidden
up here too if you like.
So, did you and Ginny
do it then?
What?
Well, hide the book?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, g--
Still no luck with Slughorn then,
I take it?
Luck.
That's it.
All I need is a bit of luck.
Well, how do you feel?
Excellent.
Really excellent.
Remember, Slughorn usually
leaves early, takes a walk,
and then
returns to his office.
Right.
I'm going down to Hagrid's.
What?
No, Harry, you've got
to go to speak to Slughorn.
We have a plan.
I know but I've got a really
good feeling about Hagrid's.
I feel it's--it's
the place to be tonight.
Do you know
what I mean?
- No.
- No.
Well, trust me.
I know what I'm doing.
Or Felix does.
Hi!
- Merlin's beard, Harry!
- Sorry, sir.
I should have announced myself.
Clear my throat.
Coughed.
You probably thought
I was Professor Sprout?
Definitely.
What makes you think?
Ah well,
just your general behaviour, sir.
Just sneaking around,
jumping when you saw me.
- Are those tentacular leaves, sir?
- Yes.
They're very valuable,
aren't they?
Ten galleons a leaf
to the right buyer.
Not that I'm familiar with
any such back alley transactions
but one does hear rumours.
My only interests
are purely academical.
I mean, personally,
these plants always kinda freak me out.
Exactly how did you get
out of the castle, Harry?
Through the front door, sir.
I'm off to Hagrid's, you see.
He's a very dear friend
and I just fancy paying him a visit.
So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.
- Harry!
- Sir?
It's nearly nightfall.
Surely, you realise
I can't allow you to go
roaming the grounds
by yourself.
Well then, by all means,
come along, sir.
Harry, I must insist you
accompany me
back to the castle
immediately!
That would
be counterproductive, sir.
And what makes
you say that?
No idea.
Horace.
Merlin's beard!
Is that an actual Acromantula?
A dead one,
I think, sir.
Good God.
Dear fellow, however
did you manage to kill it?
"Kill it"?
My oldest friend,
he was.
I'm so sorry,
I didn't--
Ah, don't worry yourself.
You're not alone.
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.
The eyes I reckon,
they unnerve some folk.
Not to mention
the pincers.
Yeah,
I reckon that too.
Hagrid...
The last thing
I wish to be is indelicate
but Acromantula venom
is uncommonly rare.
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two,
purely for academic purposes,
you understand?
Well I don't suppose it's gonna do him
much good now is it.
My thoughts exactly.
I have a ampoule or two about my person
for just such occassions as this.
Old... Potion master's habit,
you know?
I wish you could have
seen him with his prime.
Magnificent, he was.
Just magnificent.
Would you like me
to say a few words?
Yes.
Had a family, I trust?
Oh, yeah.
- Farewell...
- Aragog.
Farewell, Aragog.
King of the arachnids.
Your body will decay...
but your spirit lingers on
and your human friends
find solace,
the loss
they have sustained.
# Laid to rest, #
# And his wand,
snapped in two, #
# Which was sad, #
I had him from an egg,
you know?
Tiny little thing he was
when he hatched.
No bigger
than a Pekingese.
A Pekingese, mind you.
How sweet!
I once had a fish.
Francis.
He was very dear to me.
One afternoon,
I came downstairs and...
it vanished.
Poof.
That's very odd,
isn't it?
Yes, doesn't it?
But that's life!
I suppose,
you--you go along with
and suddenly...
poof.
Poof.
Poof.
It was a student
who gave me Francis.
One spring afternoon,
I discovered the bowl on my desk...
With just a few inches
of clear water in it...
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.
As I watched, it sank.
But just before
it reached the bottom,
it transformed
into a wee fish.
It was beautiful magic.
Wondrous to behold.
The flower petal
had come from a lily.
Your mother.
The day I came downstairs,
day's the bowl was empty.
That's the day
your mother...
I know
why you're here.
But I can't help you.
It would ruin me.
Do you know
why I survived, Professor?
The night I got this?
Because of her,
because she sacrificed herself...
Because she refused
to step aside.
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
- I'm not afraid of the name, Professor.
I'm going
to tell you something.
Something others
have only guessed at.
It's true.
I am the Chosen One.
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so,
I need to know
what Tom Riddle asked you
all those years ago
in your office
and I need to know
what you told him.
Be brave, Professor.
Be brave
like my mother.
Otherwise,
you disgrace her.
Otherwise,
she died for nothing.
Otherwise,
the bowl will remain empty.
Forever.
Please, don't think badly of me
when you say it.
I had no idea
what he was like, even then.
I was in the library
the other day.
In the restricted section...
and I read something
rather odd about this rare magic.
It's called, as I understand it,
a Horcrux.
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.
I came across the term
while reading...
and I didn't fully
understand it.
I'm not sure
what you were reading, Tom,
but this is very dark stuff.
Very dark, indeed.
Which is...
why I came to you.
A horcrux is an object
in which a person has concealed
part of their soul.
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.
One splits one's soul
and hides part of it in an object.
By doing so,
you are protected,
should you be attacked
and your body destroyed.
Protected?
That part of your soul
which is hidden lives on.
In other words,
you cannot die.
And how does
one splits his soul, sir?
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.
Murder.
Yes, killing rips the soul apart
and it is a violation against nature.
Can you only
split the soul once?
For instance,
isn't seven--
Seven?
Merlin's beard, Tom!
Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?
To rip the soul
in seven pieces!
This is all hypothetical,
isn't it, Tom?
All academic?
Of course, sir.
It'll be our little secret.
Sir.
This is beyond anything
I imagined.
Do you mean, sir,
he succeeded, sir?
- In making a Horcrux?
- Oh yes, he succeeded, alright.
- And not just once.
- What are they exactly?
It could be anything.
Most common place
of objects.
A ring, for example,
or a book.
Tom Riddle's diary.
It's a horcrux, yes.
Four years ago when you saved
Ginny Weasley's life
in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.
I knew then,
this was a different kind of magic.
Very dark,
very powerful.
But until tonight,
I had no idea just how powerful...
- And the ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux--
One destroys Voldemort.
How would you
find them?
They could be hidden anywhere,
couldn't they?
True, but magic,
especially dark magic...
leaves traces.
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?
When you leave the school.
Yes, and I think perhaps,
I may have found another.
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.
Once again, I must ask
too much of you, Harry.
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much,
that you take too much
for granted?
Has it ever crossed
your brilliant mind
that I don't want
to do this anymore?
Whether it has or hasn't
is irrelevant.
I will not negotiate
with you, Severus.
You agreed.
Nothing more to discuss.
Oh, Harry...
You need a shave,
my friend.
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.
At times, I still see
the small boy from the cupboard.
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.
I'm an old man.
You still look
the same to me, sir.
Just like your mother,
you are unfailingly kind.
A trait people never fail
to undervalue, I'm afraid.
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.
I promise you for the company of me
and I stand by that promise.
But there's one condition.
You must obey every command
I give you without question.
Yes, sir.
You do understand
what I'm saying.
Should I tell you to hide,
you hide.
Should I tell you to run,
you run.
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself,
you must do so.
Your word, Harry.
My word.
Take my arm.
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.
Well, being me
has its privileges.
This is the place.
Oh, yes.
This place has known magic.
Sir.
In order to gain passage,
payment must be made.
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.
You should have
let me, sir.
No, no, Harry. Your blood's
much more precious than mine.
Voldemort would not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.
He would put
certain defenses in position.
Careful.
There it is.
The only question is
how do we get there?
If you would, Harry.
Do you think
the Horcrux is in there, sir?
Oh, yes.
It has to be drunk.
All of it
has to be drunk.
You remember the conditions
on which I brought you with me?
This potion
might paralyze me.
I may risk
to get what I'm here.
I'd cause me so much pain
that I'd beg for relief.
You are not to indulge
these requests.
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.
Even if you have
to force it down my throat.
Understood?
Why can't I drink it, sir?
Because I'm much older,
much cleverer and much less valuable.
Your good health, Harry.
Professor.
Professor!
Professor.
Can you hear me?
Professor!
You have to keep drinking
like you said, remember?
- Stop.
- I will stop. I will stop.
But only--
only if you keep drinking.
- Don't make me-- Kill me.
- I'm sorry, sir.
Kill me!
All my fault.
My fault.
Just one more, sir.
One more, I promise.
- I promise I'll do what you say.
- No, no.
I promise!
Please!
Harry.
Water.
- Water.
- Water.
Look, you did it, sir.
Look.
Harry...
water.
Aguamenti!
Water.
Lumos.
Lumos maxima!
Stupefy! Stupefy!
Sectumsempra!
- Harry...
- Incarcerous!
- Stupefy!
- Harry...
Harry...
Partis Temporus!
Go to your houses!
No toddling!
We need to get you
to the hospital wing, sir.
To Madam Pomfrey.
No...
Severus, Severus is awakening.
Wake him.
Tell him what happened.
Speak
to no one else.
Severus, Harry.
Hide yourself below,
Harry.
Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.
Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.
Harry, do as I say.
Trust me.
Trust me.
Good evening, Draco.
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?
Who else is here?
I heard you talking.
I often talk aloud to myself.
I find it extraordinarily useful.
Have you always been
to yourself, Draco?
Draco,
you are no assassin.
How do you know
what I am?
I've done things
that would shock you.
Oh, like cursing Katie Bell
and hoping that in return
she would bear
a cursed necklace to me?
Like replacing a bottle of mead
with one lace with poison.
Forgive me, Draco,
I cannot help feel
these actions are so weak
that your...
heart can't
really have been in.
He trusts me.
I was chosen.
I shall make it
easy for you.
Expelliarmus!
Very good.
Very good.
You're not alone.
There are others.
How?
The Vanishing Cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.
I've been mending it.
Let me guess, it has a sister.
A twin.
In Borgin and Burkes.
- They form a passage.
- Ingenious.
Draco, years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.
Please let me
help you.
I don't want your help.
Don't you understand?
I have to do this.
I have to kill you.
Or he's gonna kill me.
Oh,
look what we have here.
Well done, Draco.
Good evening, Bellatrix.
I think introductions aren't over,
don't you?
Love to, Albus,
but I'm afraid
we're on a bit of tight schedule.
Do it!
He doesn't have
the stomach.
Just like his father.
Let me finish him
in my own way.
No, the Dark Lord was clear
the boy has to do it.
This is your moment, Draco.
Do it!
Go on, Draco,
now!
No.
Severus.
Please...
Avada Kedavra.
Hagrid!
Snape,
he trusted you!
Go on!
Incarcerous!
Fight back, you coward!
Fight back!
No, he belongs
to the Dark Lord.
Sectumsempra!
You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?
Yes,
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.
Potter...
Enlighten
what has happened.
If you should have the need
to talk to someone...
You should know...
Professor Dumbledore...
You meant
a great deal to him.
Do you think
he would have done it?
Draco.
No.
No, he was lowering
his wand.
In the end,
it was Snape.
It was always Snape.
I did nothing.
It was fake.
Open it.
To the Dark Lord:
I know I will be dead
long before you read this
but I want you
to know
that it was I
who discovered your secret.
I have stolen
the real Horcrux
and intend to destroy it
as soon as I can.
I face death in the hope
that when you meet your match,
you will be mortal
once more.
R.A.B.
- R.A.B.?
- Don't know.
But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.
It means
it was all a waste.
All of it.
Ron's okay with you,
you know.
You and Ginny.
If I were you when he's around,
I'd keep snogging to a minimum.
I'm not coming back,
Hermione.
I got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.
And I don't know
where that'll leave me,
but I'll let you and Ron
know where I am...
when I can.
I've always admired
your courage, Harry.
But sometimes,
you can be really thick.
You don't really think
you're going to be able
to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?
You need us, Harry.
I never realised
how beautiful this place was.
These are dark time
there is no denying.
Our world has prehaps faced no greater
threat than it does today.
But I say this to our citizens.
We, ever your servants ...
... Will continue to defend you liberty
and repel the forces that seek to take it from you.
Your ministry remains strong.

HARRY POTTER AND
THE DEATHLY HALLOWS / i
Severus, I was beginning to worry
you'd lost your way...
...Come, we have saved you a seat
- You bring news, I trust
- It will happen next Saturday.
At nightfall
I've heard differently
my lord.
Dawlish, the auror has let slip
that the Potter boy will not be moved
until the 30th of this month.
The day before he turns 17
This is a false trail
The auror office no longer plays any part
in the protection of Harry Potter.
Those closest to him think
that we have infiltrated the Ministry.
Well, they got that right., didn't they ?
What say you , Pius?
One hears many things
my lord.
But whether the truth is
among them, is not clear.
Spoken like a true politican.
you will I think
prove most useful, Pius.
- Where will he be taken the boy?
- To a safe house.
Most likely the home
of someone in the Order.
I'm told its been given protection
of every manner possible
Once there it will be
impractical to attack him
My lord, I'd like to
volunteer myself for this task.
I want to kill the boy
Wormtail
Have i not spoken to you
about keeping our guest quiet ?
Yes, my lord.
Right away, my lord.
As inspiring as I find
your bloodlust, Bellatrix ...
... I must be the one
to kill Harry Potter.
But I face an
unfortunate complication.
My wand and the Potters
share the same core.
They are, someways, twins.
We can wound but not
fatally harm one another.
If I am to kill him ...
... must do it with
anothers wand
Well, surely one of you
would like the honor
What about you, Lucius?
- My lord?
- "My Lord"?
I require your wand.
- Do I detect elm?
- Yes, my Lord.
And the core?
- Dragon heartstring my lord
- Dragon heartstringt?
To those of you who do not know ...
...we are joined here tonight
by Miss Charity Burbage ...
... who until recently taught
at Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry
Her speciality was muggle studies
It is Miss Burbage's belief that
Muggles are not so different. than us
She would given her way ...
... have us mate with them.
To her the mixture of magical and
Muggle blood is not an abomination ...
... but something,
to be encouraged.
Severus.
Severus, please.
We're friends.
Nagini.
Dinner.
- Hello Harry!
- Hi!
- Hi!
- You're looking fit.
Yeah, he is absolutely gorgeous...
Lets say we get undercover,
before someone blows you..
Do you?
Kingsley, weren't you looking
after the PrimeMinister?
You are more important.
- Hello Harry. Bill Weasley.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- He wasn't always so handsome
- Daredevil.
- True enough
Happened while fighting a werewolf called Greyback
I Would like to return the favour one day
You're still beautiful to me, Billy.
Just remember, Fleur
Bill takes his steak on the raw side now
My husband the joker.
By the way,
Wait till you hear the news....
Can't wait no time for cozy catch up.
We have to get the hell out of here.
Potter, you are underage, which means
you've still got the trace on you.
What is the trace?
If you sneezed, the Ministry
will know who wiped your nose.
The point is that we have to use those modes,
of transport which the trace can't detect
Brooms, thestrals and like
We'll go in pairs.
That way if anything is out there waiting
for us...I reckon there will be
... they won't know which
Harry Potter is the real one.
The real one ?
I do believe you are fully
aware of this particular brew
- No, absolutely not.
- I told you he won't take it well.
No, if you think that I'll let,
everyone risk their lives for me ...
- Have done if before, haven't we.
- No, no, this is different.
Taking that becoming me.
No!
Well none of us really
fancy it mate
Yes, imagine if something went wrong,
and we be stuck as scrawny specky gits forever
Everyone here is of age, Potter.
They all agreed to take the risk.
Technically I'd been coerced
Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. Aways been a huge admirer.
Nip it, Mundungus.
- Alright Granger its discussed
- Blimey, Hermione!
Put it in there, please.
For those of you who haven't taken
polyjuice potion before, fair warning.
Tastes like goblin piss
Have enough of that
experience do you Mad-eye?
Just trying to defuse the
tension.
- Wow! we are identical!
- Not yet you are not.
- Haven't you got something a bit more sporting?
- Yeah I don't really fancy this color.
Well fancy this , you are not you
so shove it up and strip
Alright, Alright
You too, Potter.
Bill, look away, I'm hideous.
- Ginny did lie about that tattoo.
- Harry, your eyesight really is aweful.
Well,we will be pairing off.
Everyone will have a protector.
Mundungus, stick tight to me.
I want to keep an eye on you
- As for Harry ...
- Yes?
The real Harry.
Where the devil are you anyway?
- Here.
- You ride with Hagrid.
I brough you here 16 years ago,
when you were no bigger than a bowtruckle.
Seems only right that
I should be the one that takes you away.
Yes this is all very touching.
Lets go !
Head for the Burrow.
We rendezvous you there.
- On the count of three!
- Hold tight, Harry!
One!
Two!
Three!
Help!
- Hagrid, we have to help the others!
- We can't do that, Harry
Mad-Eye's orders.
Hang on!
Stupefy! / i
Hang on, Harry!
Hagrid!
No! No!
Harry!
Hagrid! Hagrid!
What happened?
Where are the others?
Is noone else back?
They were on to us
way from the start, Molly.
We didn't stand a chance.
Well, thank goodness
you two are allright
Death Eaters were waiting
for us. Attacked us.
George and Ron
should have been back.
A dad with Fred too.
Here.
Quick.
Into the house.
Oh My boy ...
- Come here!
- What are you doing?
What creature sat in the corner the first time when
Harry Potter visited of my office in Hogwarts.
- Are you mad?
- What creature?
A Grindylow.
We have been betrayed .
Voldemort knew
you were being moved tonight.
I had to make sure,
you were not an imposter.
Wait!
The last words Albus Dumbledore,
spoke to the pair of us.
"Harry is the best hope we have."
"Trust him."
What gave you away?
Hedwig i think.
She was trying to protect me.
Thanks.
He deserves that. Brilliant he was.
I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for him.
Really?
Why is it always so suprising?
We are the last back?.
Where's George?
How are you feeling, Georgie?
- Saintlike.
- Come again?
Saintlike.
Im holey. I'm holey fred
Get it?
A whole wide world of ear related
humour and you go for holey.
Pathetic.
I'm still better looking than you.
Mad-Eye is dead.
Mundungus took one look at Voldemort
and disapparated.

Going somewhere?
Nobody else is going to die.
Not for me.
Because of you?
You think Mad-Eye died
for you?
Think George
took that curse for you?
You maybe the chosen one, mate ...
... but this is a whole lot bigger than that.
Its always been bigger than that.
- Come with me.
- And leave Hermione?
Are you mad.
We won't last two days.
without her
Do not tell her
I said that.
Besides you still have the trace on you,
you still got the wedding ...
... the wedding ...
- I don't care about a wedding.
I'm Sorry, no matter whose it is.
I have to start finding these Horcruxes?.
They are our only chance,
to beat him.
And the longer we stay here,
the stronger he gets.
Try and understand me
You will only be doing him a favor.
Do you think he knows?
I mean they are bits of his soul,
the Horcruxes.
Pieces of him.
When Dumbledore destroyed the Ring ...
... and you destroyed
Tom Riddle's Diary.
He must have felt something?.
To kill thei other Horcruxes,
we have to find them?.
Where are they?
Where do we start?

How it it going?
Great.
Well, hell.
What is the Minister of Magic doing here?
To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?
I think we both know the answer
to that question, Mr. Potter.
Herein is is said forth
...?
the last will and testament of ...
... Albus Percival Wulfric
Brian Dumbledore.
First, to
Ronald Billius Weasley ... "
"... I leave my delumintor."
"A device, of my own making ..."
"... In hope when things
seem most dark ... "
"... it will show you the light."
- Dumbledore left this for me?
- Yes.
Really.
What is it?
Super.
" To Hermione Jean Granger ..."
"... I leave my copy of
Tales of Beedle the Bard / i ..."
"... In the hope that she finds it
entertaining and instructive "
Mom used to tell me those.
The wizard and the hopping pot,
Babbity Rabbity and the Cackling Stump ...
Come on.
Babbity Rabbity...
No?
"To Harry James Potter ..."
"... I leave the snitch he caught
in his first match at Hogwarts... "
"... As a reminder of
rewards of perseverance ... "
"... And skill."
Is that it then?
Not quite.
Dumbledore left you ...
... a second bequest
The sword of
Godric Gryffindor.
Unfortunately the sword of Gryffindor
was not Dumbledore's to give away.
As an important
historical artifact it belongs ...
to Harry.
It belongs to Harry.
It came to him when he most
needed it in the Chamber of Secrets.
The sword may present itself to
any worthy Gryffindor, Miss Granger ...
... but that does not make it
that wizards property
Unfortunately the current
whereabout of the sword are unknown.
Excuse me?
The Sword is Missing.
I don't know what you are up,
to, Mr. Potter ...
... but you can't fight
this war on your own
He is too strong.
Hello, Harry.
i've interrupted
deep thoughts, haven't I?
I see a growing
in your eyes
Of course not.
How are you, Luna?
Very well, The garden
gnome has bitten my finger...
Gnome saliva is s very benificial.
Xenophilius Lovegood.
We live just over the hill.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
I trust you know
Mr. Potter ...
... we at the Quibbler, disagree with Daily Prophet,
and have always fully supported Dumbledore ...
... during his lifetime and after his death,
and we also support you.
Thank you.
Come Daddy.
Harry does not want to talk to us right now?.
He is just too polite
to point it out.
Harry Potter ...
Excuse me, sir.
- May I sit down?
- Mr. Potter.
By all means...here
I found what you wrote
in the Daily Prophet.
really moving.
You obviously knew
Dumbledore well.
Well, I certainly
knew him the longest.
Unless we count his brother Aberforth,
and somehow people never do seem to count Aberforth.
I didn't even know
he had a brother.
Ah Well, Dumbledore was always
very private, even as a boy.
Do not despair, Elphias.
I'm told he has been thoroughly
unrevealed by Rita Skeeter.
in 800 pages.
Word has it
that someone talked to her.
Someone who knew the
Dumbledore family well.
Both you and I know
who that is , Elphias.
Monstrous betrayal.
Who are we talking about?
Bathilda Bagshot.
- Who?
- Oh, boy ...
... she's only the most celebrated
magical historian of the last century.
She was as close to Dumbledore
as anyone
Sure Rita Skeeter thought it well
worth a trip to Godric's Hollow ...
... to take a peek into
that old birds records.
Godris Hollow?
Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?
Thats where she first met Dumbledore.
You don't say thar he lived there too.
His family moved
there ...
... after his father killed
those three Muggles.
It was a quite the scandal.
Honestly my boy ...
... are you sure
that you knew him at all?

Shaftesbury Avenue.

with mom and dad.
I do not know why I though of it. It was
the first thing to come to my head
This way.
Have you ever seen this before?
Kreacher?
- It is Master Regulus's locket!
- There were two, weren't there?
Where is the other one?
Kreacher deosn't know
about the other locket.
Yes, but did you ever see it?
It was in this house.
Flithy mudblood...bloodtraitor Weasley!
Answer her.
Yes It was here, in this house.
Most evil object.
- What do you mean?
- Before Master. Regulus died ...
... he ordered Kreacher to destroy the locket,
but no matter how hard Kreacher tried,
he could not do it.
Well, where is it now?
- Did someone take it?
- He came in the night.
He took many things
including the locket.
Who?
Who was it, Kreacher?
Mundungus.
Mundungus Fletcher.
Find him.
My father will hear about this.
Hey loosers.
He isn't here.
HARRY POTTER
UNDESIRABLE NUMBER 1 / i
As your new Minister of Magic ...
... I promise to restore this temple
of tolerance to its former glory.
MAGIC IS MIGHT / i
- Therefore beginning today ...
... each employee will submit
themselves... to evaluation
.
But know this, that you
have nothing to fear...
... if you have nothing to hide.
They have flesh memories.
When Scrimgeour first gave it to you,
I thought, that it might open at to your touch.
Dumbledore could have
hidden something inside it.
- Harry Potter!
- Zlezte of me!
Expelliarmus / i
What are you playing at?
Setting a pair of bleeding
elf on me?
Dobby was only trying to help.
Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley ...
... which Dobby thought was curious and then
Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name.
And then Dobby saw Kreacher
talking with the thief.
Me a thief ?
You foul little ...
- You're a thief, Dung, everyone knows it.
- Mr. Weasley.
- So good to see you.
- Nice shoes.
Listen.
I panicked, alright?
He was right on me and
Mad-Eye fell off his broom
- You ...
- Tell the truth.
When you turned this place over, don't deny it
You found a locket am I right?
Boy, was it valuable?
Bleeding gave it away, didn't I ?
There I was selling my goods ...
... when some Ministry hag comes up
and asks to see my license.
she says
she would lock me up?.
Would have done too if she
didn't take a fancy to that locket.
Who was it?
The witch, do you know her?
No ...
Oh ! She's there.
Look.
Its that old hag
MINISTRY SEEKS
EDUCATIONAL REFORM / i
Right
Remember what we said.
Don't speak to anybody,
Unless it is absolutely necessary.
Just ...
Try and act normal.
Do what everybody
else is doing.
Do that and with a bit of luck
we'll get inside.
- And then ...
- It gets really tricky.
Right.
- This is completely mental.
- "Completely ?"
The world is mental.
Come on.
We have a Horcrux to find.
We have to flush
ourselves in.
Its bloody Disgusting.
- Are those ...?
- Muggles.
In there ... rightful place.
Let me tell you
stop to freak out a bit.
How long did you say
this polyjuice potion will last, Hermione?
I didn't.
Cattermole.
Its still raining inside my
office. Its been two days now.
Have you tried an umbrella?
You realize i'm going downstairs
don't you, Cattermole?
- Downstairs?
- To interrogate your wife.
Now if my wife's
blood status were in doubt ...
... and the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement
needed a job doing ...
... I think I might just
make that a priority
You have one hour.
Oh my god,
what am I gonna do?
My wife is all alone
downstairs.
Ron, you don't have a wife.
- Oh right.
- Level 2
- How do I stop it raining
- Try Finite Incantatem. / I
This is you, Ron.
Finite Incantatem. / i
Okay.
And if it doesn't work?
I say if don't locate Umbridge within the hour,
we find Ron and come back another day.
- Deal?
- Yes.
Ah, Mafalda

Good.

Calm down. / i
Lets get back to work, please.
Calm down.
Runcorn?
Morning.
- Ron, it's me.
- Harry!
Blimey!
I forgot what you look like.
- Where is Hermione?
- She's gone down to the court rooms, with Umbridge.
I am half blood.
My father was a wizard.
He worked there 30 years.
Perhaps you know him.
He Always wore a jacket or vice versa.
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole,
- Yes.
- It's here.
Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred;
Wife to Reginald?
Regi.
Thank you, Albert.
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole.
Yes?
A wand was taken from you
upon your arrival at the Ministry Mrs Cattermole
Is this that wand?
Would you please tell the court,
from witch or wizard you took this wand ?
No one.
I bought it in Diagon Alley,
by Ollivanders, when I was 11.
It chose me.
You are lying. Wands choose only witches,
and you're not a witch.
But I am.
Tell them, Reg, tell them I am.
What on Earth are you doing, Albert?
You are lying, Dolores.
One must not tell lies.
Stupefy! / i
- It's Harry Potter!
- It is him. Its okay to tell the kids.
Expecto patronum! / i
Mary.
Go on home.
Take the kids
I'll meet you there.
We have to leave the country, do you understand?
Mary, do as I say.
Mary?
Who is that?
Long story...
Nice meeting you.
Harry Potter.
It's Harry. Harry Potter.
Harry.
Harry, quickly, in my bag.
There is a bottle labeled
Essence of Dittany. / i
Quickly!
Accio Dittany! / i
Good.
Unstopper it.
Hermione, his arm.
I know just do it!
Its gonna...
This is gonna Sting a little bit
What happened? I thought we
were going to go back to Grimmauld Place.
We were.
Alright, One more, One more
We were there we were there but,
Yaxley got a hold of me ...
... and he saw
where we went ...
... We couldn't stay there,
so I brought us here, but ...
... Ron splinched.
It's good.
Protego Totalum. / i
- Salvia Hexi. / i
- What are you doing?
Protective enchantments.
I do not want a repeat of what happened at
Shaftesbury Avenue, do you?
-Get going with a tent
- Tent?
- Protego Totalum. / i
- Where am I supposed to find a tent?
Repello Mukletum.
Muffliato. / I
You first.
Incendio! / i
Incendio. / i
Expulso / i
Diffindo / i
Reducto / i
What are you doing?
We have to keep it safe,
until we find out how to destroy it.
Seems strange, mate.
Dumbledore sent you out to find those Horcruxes
but doesn't tell you how to destroy them
Doesn't it bother you?
You know the spell, Harry. / i
- Tell me, Gregorovitch.
- He stole it from me.
Who was it?
The thief?
The boy.
It was he who took it.
I never saw it again
I swear on my life.
I believe you.
Avada Kedavra! / i
I thought
it stopped.
You can't keep
, Harry.
- You-Know- Who found Gregorovitch.
- This Wand Maker?
He wants something that Gregorovitch used to have.
I do not know what.
But he wants it desperately.
As if his life depended on it
.
Don't, its his comfort zone.
??
It sets my teeth on edge,,
Whats he expecting to hear?? Good news?
One can only hope
not to hear bad news.
How long before he can travel?
- I'm doing everyting I can.
-You are not doing enough?
Take it off!
I said,
Take it off, now!
- Better?
- Right .
We will take in turns, okay?
What is that?
Snatchers.
Good to know,
that your enchantments work.
He could smell it.
my perfume.
I told you
Ron is not strong enough to apparate.
So we will go on foot then.
Only next time, even when I like
your perfume, do not use it.
The names of missing...
. / i
These are confirmed. / i
Oh, thank you.
He doesn't know what he is doing? does he?
None of us do.
- Oh My God !
- What?
- I'll tell you in a minute.
- You can tell me now?
Sword of Gryffindor .
Its goblin made
Brilliant.
No, you don't understand.
Dirt and dust
have no effect on the blade.
It only takes in that
which makes it stronger.
Okay ...
we are looking for a way to destroy horcrux , right ?
- Tom Riddle's diary in the Chamber of Secrets.
- With a basilisk.fang
If you tell me you got ,
one of those in that bloody beeded bag of yours ...
Don't you see? In The Chamber of Secrets
you stabbed the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor
Its blade is impregnated with
basilisk venom.
It only takes in that
which makes it stronger
- Exactly, which is why
- It can destroy Horcruxes.
Thats why Dumbledore
left it to you in his will.
You're brilliant, Hermione.
Truely.
Actually, I just highly logical thinking,
which allows to me see past and irrelevant details ...
... and perceived cleary which
others overlook
Yeah, there is only one problem.
Someone stole the sword.
Hey, I'm still here.
You two carry on.
Don't let me spoil the fun.
I told you everything
that Dumbledore told me!
Incase you haven't noticed
We have found one Horcrux already.
Yes, and we are as close to getting rid
of it as we are to finding the rest, aren't we?
Ron, Please, take off the Horcrux ...
you wouldn't have spoken like this
if you hadn't wore it all day
You know, why I listen to the radio every night?
To make sure that i don't hear Ginny's name,
or Fred, or George or moms ...
You think i don't know that ?
- You think i don't know how it feels?
- You don't know how it feels!
Your parents are dead!
You have no family!
- Stop! Stop!
- Let me Go!
- Go Then
Ron ...
And you?
Are you coming or
are you staying?
Fine. I get it.
I saw you two the other night.
Ron's ...
There is nothing.
Ron!
Ron, where are you going?
Come back, now!
Salvia Hexi
I opens at the close / i
Hermione?
Hermione?
You were right.
Snithced have flesh memory ...
... but I did not catch the first snitch with my hand.
I almost swallowed it.
- "I open at the close."
- What do you think that means?
I don't know.
I found something as well
At first I thought it was an eye
it's eye, but now I don't think it is.
And it's no rune,
it is anywhere in Spellmans syllabury.
Someone wrote it there.
Somebody inked it in
it isn't part of the book
Luna's dad was wearing that at
the wedding of Bill and Fleur.
Why would someone draw
it in a childrens book?
Hermione, I've been thinking
I want to go to Godric's Hollow
Its where I was born ,
Its where my parents died.
Thats exactly why they'll expect you to go
it means something to you
But it means something to
him too, Hermione.
You-Know-Who almost died there.
Isn't that exactly the type of place
he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?
It is dangerous, Harry.
But I admit it recently I've been thinking
we have to go there
I think its is possible that
something else is hidden there.
What?
The Sword.
If Dumbledore wanted you to find it,
and to not let it fall into the hands of the Ministry ...
... what better place to hide it
than the birthplace of founder of Gryffindor
Hermione ...
Don't tell me I have to give
you a haircut again
I still think that we
should use Polyjuice Potion.
No.
This is where I was born.
I don't want to return?,
as someone else.
Harry, I think it is Christmas eve.
Listen.
Do you think they are here, Hermione?
My mom and dad.
I think so.
Ignotus Peverell.
Hey, Harry?
Merry Christmas, Hermione.
Merry Christmas, Harry.
Harry, someone is watching us.
Near the church.
I think I know who it is.
- I don't know this, Harry.
- Hermione, Dumbledore knew.
She might have the sword.
This is where they died, Hermione.
This is where he murdered them.
Bathilda, aren't you ?
Leave it, let me do that.
Miss Bagshot,
Who is this man?
Harry!
Are you feeling better?
This time can be overcome,
Hermione.
Forest of Dean.
I came here once with my mother and father.
Years ago.
Its just
how I remember it.
Trees, the river, everything.
Like nothings changed.
This of course is true,
everything has changed.
If there were my parents,
they would have nothing nepamtali.
Or trees.
Or river.
Not even me.
Perhaps we should
stay here, Harry.
Grow old?.
You wanted to know
Who was the boy in the photograph was.
I know.
Gellert Grindelwald.
He's the thief I saw
in Gregorovitch's wandshop.
Speaking of which
where's my wand?
Where's my wand, Hermione?
As we were leaving Godrics Hollow I cast a curse.
and it rebounded
I'm sorry.
I tried to mend it,
But wands are different.
Its nothing.
Lend me yours.
Go inside and get warm.
I'll take the locket as well.
Lumos. / i
Accio sword! / i
Diffindo. / i
Hermione?
Are you mental?
Ron, is that you?
Yes.
Didn't hurt yourself did you ?
- You cast the doe as well did you?
- No, I thought that was you.
- No, my Patronus is a stag.
Clear.
Okay, Ron.
Do it.
I can not. The thing affect me more
as you and Hermione.
- All the more reason
- I can not.
then why are you here?
Why did you come back?
I'll have to speak to it to open it
When it does, don't hesitate.
I don't know whats in there, but it will put up a fight?.
The bit of Riddle in the diary was trying to kill me?.
One.
Two.
Three.
and I see your heart and it is mine. / i
I see your dreams,
Ronald Weasley. / I
I see your fear. / i
hated her mother,
who longed for a daughter. / i
Not My Favorites girl? om,
wishing your friend a. / i
Ron!
we were better without you. / i
happy without you ? astnej. / i
Who would choose you .../ i
... compared to Harry Potter? / i
What are you compared to the chosen one? / i
Ron, its lying!
Your mother confessed,
she would prefer as a son. / i
What woman would take you? / i
you are .
Nothing...Nothing / I
Nothing compared to him. / i
Just think
There are only three to go.
Hermione?
Hermione?
Is everything alright?
Fine...
Actually its more than fine.
Hi.
You ...
... a complete arse of,
a Weasley!
You show up here after weeks
and you say 'hey'?
Where's my wand, Harry?
- Where is my wand?
- I don't know.
Harry Potter
You give me my wand!
-What happened to your wand?
- Nevermind he's got my wand.
What is that?
You destroyed it.
And how is it that you just happened to have the
sword of Gryffindor ?
It's a long story.
Don't think
it changes anything.
Of course not. I only destroyed a
bloody Horcrux, why will that change anything.
I wanted to come back
as soon as I left.
-just didn't know how to find you
- how did you found us ?
With this. Doesn't just
Turn out lights
I don't know how it works
but christmas morning I sleping in this little pub ...
... keeping away from some snatchers.
- When I heard it.
- What?
Voice.
Your voice, Hermione.
comin out of it.
And what exactly did I say
if I may ask??
My name.
Just my name.
like a Whisper
So I took it, clicked it ...
... this tiny ball of light appeared
And I knew.
sure enough.
Flew towards me,
ball of light.
Right into my chest.
Straight through me.
Right here
I knew that it was gonna take me
where I needed to go
so I disapparated
came to this hillside
It was dark, I had
no idea where I was.
I just hoped
One of you will show yourself
you did
I have always liked these flames
Hermione makes.
How long do you think
she will stay mad at me?
i don't know ...
just keep talking about that little ball,
and it might touch her in the heart ...
... and she will come around.
- It's true. Every word.
This is gonna sound crazy.
But I think,thats why Dubledore left it to me
The delumintor.
I think somehow he knew
I'll need to find my way back
Hey, I just realized
you need a wand, don't yout?
I got one here.
Blackthorn 10 inches ,
nothing special.
- But be uploaded with just. - I took off
a snatcher few weeks ago
Don't tell hermione this
Definitely was a troll,
by the smell of it.
Engorgio. / i
Finite / i
We need to talk.
Yeah, alright
I want to go see
Xenophilius Lovegood.
Sorry?
See this ? It is a letter
Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald.
Look at the signature.
It's the mark again
It keeps cropping up.
in The tales of Beedle the Bard,
in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow ...
it was there too.
- Where?
- Outside Gregorvitch's wandshop.
- What dors it mean?
- Look...
You have no idea where the next Horcrux is
, and neither I do
But this,
this means something.
- I am sure of it.
- Yeah. Hermione's right.
We ought to see Lovegood
Lets vote.
Those in favor.
are you still mad at him?
I am always mad at him
KEEP OFF THE
DIRIGIBLE PLUMS / i
Do not touch
Dirigible Plums.
What is it?
Who are you?
What do you want?
Hello, Mr. Lovegood.
I'm Harry Potter,
we met a few months ago.
Can we come in?
Where is Luna?
I don't know.
She will be along.
So...how can I
help you, Mr Potter ?
Well, actually ...
... it was about something that you were wearing
around your neck at the wedding. A symbol.
- You mean this?
- Yes.
That's it exactly
What I wonder is ...
what is it?
What is it?
Well.. its the sign of
the deathly hallows ofcourse .
- The What?
- The What?
The Deathly Hallows. I assume you are all
familiar with the tale of the three brothers?
- Yes.
- No.
I have it in here.
There were once three brothers,
who were travelling along a lonely
winding road ...
... at twilight
- Midnight.
Mom always said midnight.
Twilight is fine.
better actually.
There were once three brothers,
who were travelling along a lonely
winding road ...
... at twilight.
In time the brothers reached a
river too treacherous to pass
But they were learned in the magical arts
the three brothers simply waved their wands..
... and made a bridge.
Before they could cross however they
found their path blocked by a hooded figure.
It was Death
And he felt cheated
Cheated, because travelers
usually drowned in the river.
But Death was cunning.
he pretended to congratulate
the three brothers .on their magic..
... and said,
that each had earned a prize ...
... for being clever enough
to evade him
the oldest asked for a wand,
more powerful than any in existence
so death fashioned him a wand
from the elder tree that stood nearby
The second brother he decided
he wanted to humiliate death
even further..
... and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from
their graves
So Death picked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.
Finally, Death turned to
the third brother.
A humble man, asked for something
that allowed him to go from that place...
...without being followed
by death
And so it was that death reluctantly
handed over his own cloak of
invisibility
The first brother travelled
to a distant village...
... with the elder wand in his hand
he killed a wizard with whom he once had quarrels..
Drunk with the power that
the elder wand had given him..
... he bragged about it
You shall not prevail against his nose? ou.
But that night ...
...another wizard stole the wand
and slit the brothers throat for good measure.
And so the death took the first brother.
for his own
The second brother journeyed home,
where he took the stone and
turned it thrice in his hand
To his delight the girl he once
wanted to marry before her untimely death...
... appeared before him.
But soon she turned sad and cold
because she did not belong to the mortal world
Driven mad with hopeless longing
the second brother killed himself
so as to join her
And so death took the second brother
As for the third brother Death
searched for many years
but was never able to find him
only when he had attained a great age the
youngest brother shed the cloak of invisibilty
and gave it to his son ...
.. he then greeted death
as a old friend
and went with him gladly
departing this life as equals
so there we are
Those are the Deathly Hallows.
I'm sorry sir,
I still don't quite understand.
The Elder wand ...
... the most powerful wand
ever made.
The resurrection stone
The cloak of invisibility
Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.
Together they make one
master of death.
That mark was on the grave in
Godrics Hollow.
Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell
family have something to do with
the deathly hallows
Yes, Ignotus, and his brothers
Cadmus and Antioch were the original owner of the hallows ...
... and therefore inspiration for the story.
Your tea has gone cold
Don't go
I'll be right back?.
Let's get out of here .
I have more of this brndy pi? I will not.
- Thank you for ...
- You forgot the water.
- Water ?
- In the tea.
How silly of me.
You do not have to,
we should be going any way.
No, you do not!
Sir?
You are my only hope.
They were angry, you see,
because of what I've been writing.
so they took ...
... took my children.
my children
??
Who took her, sir?
Voldemort.
I got it!
treacherous little bleeder!
is there no one we can trust?
they kidnapped her
because he supported me.
He was just desperate.
I'll do the enchantments.
Hello beautiful.
Don;t just hang back
Snatch them
Harry.
Tell me. what to do Tell me, where it is. / I
Grindelwald.
Grindelwald.
-??
-??
I knew
that one day you come.
But surely as you know.
i no longer have what you seek.
I believe you Grindelwald,
tell me where it is
Tell me who posseses it.
The elder wand lies with him
ofcourse....
Buried in the earth.
with Dumbledore.
The hallows exist
He is only after one... the last one
He knows where it is.
he's gonna have it by the end of the night?.
you know who's had the elder wand.
Do not touch her!
Your boyfriend will get much worse for that
if he doesn't learn to behave himself
And what happened to you, ugly?
No, not you.
- What is your name?
- Dudley. Vernon Dudley.
Check it.
And you him and ugly, lovely?
What do they call you?
Penelope Clearwater
Half blood
There is no Vernon Dudley on here.
You hear that ugly?
This means you're lying to us.
- Why did not you tell us? Who you are?
- Do you have a mistake, I already told you who I am.
Change of plan.
We are not taking this lot to the Ministry.
Get Draco.
Well?
I can't be sure.
Look closely, son.
If we are the ones who
hand Potter to the Dark Lord....
... everything would be forgiven,
it would all be as it was understood ?
Now we won't be forgetting
who really caught him ...
...I hope Mr Malfoy.
- Don't dare to talk to me like that in my own house
- Lucius!
Do not be shy, come closer!
If this isn't who you
think it is Draco ...
... and we will call Him,
He'll kill us all. We need to be absolutely sure!
- Whats wrong with his face?
- Yes, what it wrong with his face?
We captured him like that.
Something he captured in the forrest I reckom
That happens during a stinging jinx
Was it you
Give me your wand, let's see
what your last spell was
And I? A.
Whats that?
Where did you get that from?
It was in her bag when we searched her
I reckon its mine now.
Are you mad?
Get out!...Get out!
Cissy ...
... hold those boys in the basement!
I'd like a conversation with this one...
... girl to girl!
What are we gonna do??
We can't leave Hermione alone with her!
Ron?
Harry?
Luna?
The Sword is meant to be in my vault
How did you get it?
- Did you and your friend STEAL FROM MY VAULT?
-
I didn't take anything.
I do not believe you.
- We have to do something?!
- There is no way out of here.
We tried everything.
It's enchanted
You are Bleeding Harry, its a curious thing to
keep on yourself
Help us!
- Let her go
- Get Back!
You Goblin, come with me.
Dobby?
What are you doing here?
Dobby has come to rescue
Harry Potter!
Dobby will alwyas be
there for Harry Potter.
You say that you can apparate
out of this room ?
- Can you take us with you
- Of course, I'm a elf
No clear.
Well, Dobby, take Luna
and Mr. Ollivander, please.
Take them to shell cottage
its near the sea.
Trust me.
When you're ready, sir.
Sir?
I like her very much!
Meet me at top of the
stairs in ten seconds.
Who gets his wand?
So once again, goblin
Think it very very carefully.
- How to get there?
- I do not know!
You don't know?
Please try again.
Who got into my vault?
Who stole it?
Who stole it?
Impossible to break into Gringotts
the sword is there.
Mudblood / i
How did it get here then?
Nowhere is safer,
than in Gringotts bank.
Consider yourself lucky goblin
- This does not apply to her.
- You only think!
Expelliarmus / i
Stupefy! / i
Stop!
Drop your wands.
I said, drop them!
Pick em up, Draco, now!
Well well well ...
Look who we have here.
Its Harry Potter.
Whole bright shiny and new
Just in time for the Dark Lord.
Call him.
Call him
Stupefy! / i
Stupid elf!
You could have kill me?!
Dobby never meant to kill .
Dobby only meant to maim or
seriously injure
How dare you take a
witch's wand?
How dare you
defy your masters?
Dobby has no master!
Dobby is a free elf...
... and Dobby has come to save
Harry Potter and his friends
Hermione!
Are you alright?
We are safe.
We are all safe.
Harry Potter ...
Dobby!
That would be fine ...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on, yes?
We are going to fix it.
Hermione, the dittany ...
... in your purse!
Hermione!
Hermione!
Help me!
It's so beautiful than alone...
... with you here as friends.
Dobby is Happy ...
... that may be
with his friend ...
... Harry Potter.
We should close his eyes ...
... don't you think
There
Now he could be sleeping.
I want to bury him...
...Properly, without magic.
It's beautiful here.
It was our aunt's.
We used to come here as kids.
The Order uses it now as a safe house.
What's left of us atleast.
Muggles think these
things keep evil away.
But they're wrong.
I need to talk to the Goblin.
How are you?
- You buried the elf?
- Yes.
And brought me here.
You are...
Pretty unusual, is it?
How did you come by the sword?
It's complicated.
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think
that it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
It's complicated.
The sword presented itself to us,
in moment of need.
We didn't steal it.
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault
identical to this one.
But it is a fake.
It was placed there this past summer.
And she never suspected it was a fake.
The replica is very convincing.
Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.
Who is the acquaintance?
A Hogwarts Professor.
As I understand that he's now Headmaster.
Snape.
He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault.
Why?
There are more than a fewcurious things
in the vaults at Gringotts.
And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?
Perhaps.
I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.
- It is impossible.
- Alone, yes.
But with you, no.
- Why should I help you?
- I have gold.
Lots of....
I've no interest in gold.
Then what?
That.
That is my price.
Are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?
Well, she was terrified when she thought we had been in there.
She kept asking you,
what else was taken?
I bet you anything, there's Horcrux in there.
Another piece of his soul.
Let's find it, kill it, and we are
one step closer to killing him.
And what happens when we find it,
How're we supposed to destroy it, now you're giving the sword to Griphook?
I'm still working on that part.
He's weak.
Who?
Mr. Ollivander
I need to ask you a few questions.
Anything, m'boy.
Anything!
Would you mind identifying this wand?
We need to know if it's safe to use.
Uhh... Walnut
Dragon Heartstring
Unyie...
Unyielding.
This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.
Treat it carefully.
And this?
Hawthorn.
An unicorn hair.
Reasonably pliant.
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.
Was?
Is it not still?
Well, perhaps not.
If you won it from him.
I sense its allegiance has changed.
You talk about wands,
as if they have feelings...
.......can think!
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.
That much has always been clear to
those of us who've studied wandlore.
And, what do you know about the Deathly Hallows?
It is rumored there are three.
The Elder Wand, the Cloak of Invisibility,
to hide you from your enemies...
and the Resurrection Stone, to bring
back loved ones from the dead.
Together, they make one the Master of Death.
But, few truly believe that such objects exist.
Do you?
Do you believe they exist, sir?
Well...
I see no reasons to put
stock into an old wives' tale.
You're lying!
You know one exists.
You told him about it.
You told him about the Elder Wand...
and where he could go looking for it.
He tortured me.
Besides...
....I only conveyed rumors.
There's...
There's no telling whether he will find it.
He has found it, sir.
We'll let you rest.
He's after you, Mr. Potter.
If it's true what you say,
that he has the Elder Wand,
I'm afraid,
...you really don't stand a chance.
Well, I am supposed to kill him, before he finds me, then.
You're sure that's hers?
Positive.
Well?
How do I look?
Hideous.
You can give that to Hermione to hold.
Alright, Griphook?
We're relying on you, Griphook.
If you get us past the guards into the vault...
The sword's yours.
Madam Lestrange.
Good morning.
Good morning?
Good morning?
You're Bellatrix Lestrange,
not a school girl!
Hey!
Easy!
If she gives us away, we must swear
to use that sword to slit our own throats.
Understand?
No, he's right.
I speak stupid.
Okay.
Let's do it.
I wish to enter my vault.
Identification?
I hardly think that would be necessary.
Madam Lestrange.
I don't like to be kept waiting.
I know...
They know she's an impostor.
They'd be warned.
Harry...
What do we do, Harry?
Madam Lestrange,
would you mind presenting your wand?
And why should I do that?
It's the bank's policy!
I'm sure you understand, given current climate.
No! I most certainly do not understand!
I'm afraid, I must insist.
Imperio!
Very well, Madam Lestrange.
If you would follow me?
What is that, Griphook?
Griphook!
Aresto Momentum
Well done, Hermione.
Oh no, you two're like you again.
The Thief's Downfall,
washes away all enchantment.
Can be deadly.
You don't say.
Just out of interest,
is there any other way outta here?
No.
What the devil are all you doing down here?
Thieves!
You gave up the.....
-Imperio
-You!
That doesn't sound good.
Bloody hell!
It's an Ukrainian Ironbelly.
Here.
It's been trained to expect pain
when it hears this noise.
That's barbaric!
Lumos.
Blimey!
Accio Horcrux!
You seem you're gonna try
this here, won't you?
No kind of magic would work in here.
It's in here, Harry?
Can you feel anything?
That's it!
Up there!
They have added the Gemino curse.
Everything you touch will multiply.
Give me the sword.
Stop moving!
Do it!
- We had deal, Griphook!
- The cup for the sword!
I said I'll get you in,
I didn't say anything about getting you out.
Griphook! Thieves!
Griphook!
Hey, thieves!
Is that okay?
We've still got Bogrod.
That's unfortunate.
We can't just stand here,
You got any idea?
Should be a brilliant one.
I've got something,
but it's mad!
Reducto
Well, come on, then!
Relashio
Keep moving!
Now what?
Reducto
Hold on.
That was brilliant!
Absolutely brilliant!
We're dropping!
- I say we jump!
- When?
Now!
He knows.
You-Know-Who.
He knows we broke into Gringotts.
He knows what we took,
and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.
- How did he know?
- I saw him.
You let him in?
Harry, you can't do that!
Hermione, I can't always help it!
Well, maybe I can.
I don't know!
Never mind!
What happened?
Well, he's angry...
and scared too.
He knows, if we find and destroy
all the Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him.
I reckon he'll stop at nothing
to make sure we don't find the rest.
And there's more.
One of them is at Hogwarts.
What?
You saw it?
I saw the castle.
And Rowena Ravenclaw.
It must have something to do with her.
We have to go there, now!
Well, we can't do that!
We've got to plan,
we've got to figure it out!
Hermione, when have any of
our plans ever actually worked?
We plan, we get there,
all hell breaks loose.
He's right!
One problem...
Snape's Headmaster now,
we can't just move freely from the front door!
Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,
to Honeydukes.
Take the secret passage in the cellar.
It's...
There's something wrong with him.
It's like, you know,
in the past...
I've always been able
to follow his thoughts.
And now everything just feels disconnected.
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.
Maybe he's getting weaker.
Maybe he's dying!
No!
No, it's.. it's more like he's wounded.
If anything, he feels more dangerous.
- Right here. Come on!
- Search everywhere.
Go, move!
Faster!
In here, Potter.
Come on, move!
Did you look at him.
- For a second I thought that was...
- I know. Dumbledore!
Harry?
I can see you in this.
Bloody fools, what are you thinking coming here?
Have you any idea how dangerous it is?
You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother.
It's you who I've been seeing in here.
You're the one who sent Dobby.
- Why've you left him?
- He's dead.
Sorry to hear it.
I liked that elf.
Who gave that to you?
The mirror?
Mundungus Fletcher, about a year ago.
Dung had no right selling that to you.
It belongs to...
Sirius...
Albus told me.
He also told me you'd likely be hacked off,
...if you ever found that I had it.
But, ask yourself;
Where would you be if I didn't?
Do you have any others much?
From the Order?
The Order has finished.
You-Know-Who has won,
...anyone who says otherwise
is killing themselves.
We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight.
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
Did he now...
Nice job?
Easy?
We've been hunting Horcruxes.
We think the last one's inside the castle.
But we'll need your help getting in.
Which job my brother has given you, it's a suicide mission.
Do yourself a favor, boy.
Go home!
Live a little longer.
Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.
What makes you think you can trust him?
What makes you think you can
believe anything my brother told you?
And in all the time you knew him...
Did he ever mention my name?
Did he ever mentioned hers?
- Why should he...
- Keep secrets.
You tell me?
- I trusted him.
- That's the boy's answer.
A boy goes chasing Horcruxes is on the word of
a man who wouldn't even tell him where to start.
You're lying!
Not just on me, it doesn't matter.
To yourself as well.
That's what a fool does.
You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter!
So, I ask you again, there must be a reason.
I'm not interested in what happened
between you and your brother.
I don't care that you've given up.
I trusted the man I knew.
We need to get into the castle tonight.
You know what to do.
Where have you sent her?
You'll see.
Soon enough.
That's your sister, Ariana.
Isn't it?
She died very young, didn't she?
My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter.
On his journey to find power.
Including Ariana.
And she was devoted to him.
He gave her everything.
But time.
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.
He did save our lives twice!
Kept an eye on us on that mirror.
That doesn't seem like someone who's given up!
She's coming back.
What's that with her?
Neville!
- How you look...
- Like hell, I reckon.
But this is nothing.
Seamus is worse.
Hey, Ab!
We've got a couple more coming through.
Don't remember this on the Marauder's Map.
That's because it never existed till now.
The seven secret passages were sealed off,
before the start of the year.
This is the only way in or out, now.
The grounds are crawled with Death Eaters and Dementors.
How about Mr.Snape as Headmaster?
Hardly ever seen.
It's the Carrows who's watching out for.
Carrows?
Yeah. Brother and sister.
Incharge of discipline.
They like punishment, the Carrows.
They did that to you?
Why?
Today's Dark Arts lesson was
practicing the Cruciatus curse.
On first years.
I refused.
Hogwarts has changed.
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?
Hey, you lots! It's
for your surprise.
No more about Aberforth's cook's gonna help.
We'll be surprised if it's just digested.
- Oh my!
- Harry!
Get the word out to Remus and the others, that Harry is back.
Okay, okay!
Let's not kill him before You-Know-Who does.
...Do you read? we've a new weather report.
Lightning has struck. I repeat: Lightning has struck.
What's the fun, Harry?
Okay.
There's something we need to find.
There's something hidden here, in the castle.
And it may help us to defeat
You-Know-Who.
- Alright, what is it?
- We don't know.
- Where is it?
- We don't know that either.
I realize that's not much to go on.
That's nothing to go on.
I think it has something to do with Ravenclaw.
It'll be small, easily concealed.
Anyone, any ideas?
Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem.
Oh, bloody hell!
Here we go!
Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?
Hasn't anyone heard of it?
It's quite famous.
Yes. But, Luna, it's lost.
For centuries.
There's no person alive today who's seen it.
Excuse me, can someone tell me what bloody diadem is?
It's a sort of crown.
You know, like a tiara.
Harry!
Hi, there.
Six months she hasn't seen me and
it's like I'm a frankie first-year.
I'm her brother!
- She got lots of them, but she has got only one Harry.
- Shut up, Seamus!
What is it, Ginny?
Snape knows... he knows
that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.
Many of you are surely wondering,
why I have summoned you at this hour.
It's come to my attention,
that earlier this evening...
Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.
Now...
should anyone...
student or staff attempt to aid Mr. Potter?
They will be punished in a manner consistent with
the severity of their transcription, further more...
Any person found have
knowledge of these events...
who fails to come forward...
will be treated as equally guilty.
Another...
If anyone in here has any knowledge of
Mr. Potter's movements this evening.
I invite them to step forward.
Now!
It seems, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies,
...you still have a security problem, Headmaster.
I'm afraid it's quite extensive.
How dare you stand where he stood?
Tell them how it happened that night?
Tell them how you looked him in the eye...
A man who trusted you, and killed him.
Tell them!
COWARD!!!
Harry.
Potter?
I know that many of you will want to fight.
Some of you might even think to fight is wise.
But this is folly.
Give me Harry Potter.
Do this and none shall be harmed.
Give me Harry Potter,
and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.
Give me Harry Potter,
and you will be rewarded.
You have one hour.
What're you waiting for?
Someone grab him!
Students out of bed!
Students in the corridor!
They're supposed to be out of bed,
you blithering idiot!
Sorry ma'am.
As it happens, Mr. Filch...
Your arrival is most opportune.
If you would, I wouldd like you please, to lead Miss Parkinson
and the rest of Slytherin house, from the hall.
Exactly where is it I'll be leading 'em to, ma'am?
The dungeons would do.
I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter.
What is it you need?
Time, Professor.
As much as you can get me.
Do what you have to do.
I'll secure the castle.
Potter...
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too, Professor.
Hold the fort, Neville.
Harry!
Hermione and I were thinking,
it doesn't matter if we find the Horcrux.
What do you mean?
Unless we can destroy it.
So, we were thinking...
Well, Ron was thinking, it was Ron's idea.
It was completely brilliant
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary
with a Basilisk fang, right?
Well, me and Hermione did remind
where we might find one.
Okay.
Okay, but take this.
That way, you can find me when you get back.
Where're you going?
Ravenclaw common room,
Gotta start somewhere.
Harry!
Harry!
Let me get this straight, Professor...
You're actually giving us
permission to do this?
That is correct, Longbottom.
That's blowing up!
Boom!
Boom!
Wicked!
But how on earth are we gonna do that?
Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan?
As I recall, he has a particular
proclivity for pyro-technics.
I can bring it down.
That's the spirit!
Well, you go.
You do realize, of course, we can't
keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.
That doesn't mean
we can't delay him.
And his name is Voldemort.
Filius, you might as well use it.
He's come to try to kill you, either way!
Piertotum Locomotor.
Hogwarts is threatened.
Man the boundaries! Protect us.
Do your duty...
....to our school.
I always wanted to use that spell!
Protego Maxima
Fianto Duri
Repello Inimigotum
Protego Maxima
Fianto Duri
Repello....
Protego Maxima
Fianto Duri
Repello Inimigotum
Protego Maxima
Harry, wait!
I need to talk to you!
- I'm a bit pre-occupied at the moment, Luna.
- You don't know where you're going.
You're wasting your time!
Look, we'll talk later, okay?
- Harry?
- Later.
Harry Potter, you listen to me right now!
Do you remember what Cho said
about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem?
There is not a person alive who's seen it.
It's obvious, isn't it?
We have to talk to someone who's dead.
It's very impressive, isn't it?
If you want to find her,
you'll find her down there.
- Aren't you coming?
- No.
I think it's best if you two talk alone.
She's very shy.
You're the Grey Lady.
The ghost of Ravenclaw tower.
I do not answer to that name!
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
It's Helena, isn't it?
Helena Ravenclaw,
Rowena's daughter.
Are you a friend of Luna's?
Yes.
And she thought you might be able to help me.
You seek my mother's diadem?
Yes.
That's right.
Luna is kind.
Unlike so many of the others.
But she was wrong,
I cannot help you!
Wait, please!
I want to destroy it!
They never learn.
Such a pity.
My Lord...
Shouldn't we wait?
Begin!
I thought you want to do it.
Isn't it, Helena?
You want it destroyed?
Another promised
to destroy it many years ago.
A strange boy with a strange name?
Tom Riddle.
But he lied.
He lied to many people.
I know what he's done!
I know who he is!
He defiled it, with dark magic!
I can destroy it.
Once and for all.
But only if you tell me
where he hid it?
You do know where he hid it?
Don't you, Helena?
You just have to tell me.
Please!
Strange!
You remind me of him a bit.
It's here, in the castle.
In the place where everything is hidden.
If you have to ask...
....you will never know.
If you know...
...you need only ask.
Thank you!
Tell Professor McGonagall.
Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.
Yes, sir!
Hey Dean, with second thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall we
might need one or two more wands this side.
It is the quality of one's convictions that determines one's success..
...not the number of followers.
Who said that?
Me.
You okay, Freddie?
Yeah.
Me too.
Harry talks this in sleep.
You know it?
No, of course, not!
Yeah?
You-Know-Who's army?
You do it.
I can't.
Yes, you can!
Neville!
That went well.
Get inside!
Stupefy
Ginny, Neville!
You alright?
Never better!
I feel like I can spit fire!
Have you seen Luna up there?
Luna?
I'm mad for her. I think its about time I told her
since well probably both be dead by dawn.
I know.
Bloody hell!
We'll never find him on this.
Here he is!
- He's just...
- Brilliant!
He just vanished.
I'm sure I saw it.
Maybe he's gone to the Room of Requirement.
It doesn't show up on the map, does it?
You said that last year.
That's right, I did.
Let's go.
Brilliant!
Come on!
Well, well...
What brings you here, Potter?
I could ask you the same.
You have something that's mine.
I'd like it back.
What's wrong with the wand you have?
It's my mother's.
It's powerful, but it's...
..not the same.
Doesn't quite understand me.
You know what I mean?
Why didn't you tell her?
Bellatrix?
You knew it was me.
You didn't say anything.
Come on, Draco!
Don't be a prat.
Do it!
Easy!
Expelliarmus
Avada Kedavra
Stupefy
This is my girlfriend,
you bloody gits!
Got it!
They've set the bloody place on fire!
Come on!
This way!
We can't leave them!
He's joking, right?
If we die for them,
Harry, I'm gonna kill you!
Harry!
My Lord?
Avada Kedavra!
Come Nagini, I need to keep you safe.
It's the snake.
She's the last one.
It's the last Horcrux.
Look inside him, Harry.
Find out where he is,
if you find him, we can find the snake.
And we can end this!
My Lord...
Might it be less...
I should not be more prudent to call off this attack.
Simply seek the boy.
Yourself.
I do not need to seek the boy...
....before the night is out, he will come to me!
Do you understand?
Look at me!
How can you live with yourself, Lucius?
I don't know.
Go and find Severus.
Bring him to me.
I know where he is.
Come on!
No!
You have performed extra-ordinary magic
with this wand, My Lord,
in the last few hours alone.
No!
No! I am extra-ordinary.
But the wand resists me .
There is no wand more powerful.
Ollivander himself has said it.
Tonight, when the boy comes.
It will not fail you, I am sure ...
It answers to you,
and you only.
Does it?
My Lord?
The wand, does it truly
answer to me?
You're a clever man, Severus.
Surely you must know...
- Where does its true loyalty lie?
- With you...
Of course, My Lord.
The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly,
because I am not its true master.
The Elder Wand belongs to the
wizard who killed its last owner.
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.
While you live, the Elder
Wand cannot truly be mine.
You've been a good and faithful servant, Severus.
But only I can live forever.
My Lord...
Nagini, kill!
Take it...
Take it up, please!
Give me something!
Quickly, a flask. Anything!
Take them to the Pensieve.
Look at me...
You really have your mother's eyes.
You've fought valiantly,
but in vain...
I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood
spilled is a terrible waste.
I therefore command my forces to retreat...
In their absence,
dispose your dead with dignity,
Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you.
On this night, you have allowed your friends to die
for you, rather than face me yourself.
There is no greater dishonor.
Join me in the Forbidden Forrest...
...and confront your fate.
If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man,
woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.
Where's everybody?
Harry?
Oh, come on!
Don't be sad on it, she's passed.
There, she's gone.
Freak! Come here! I'm gonna tell mommy!
You're freak!
You're freak, Lily!
Come here!
She's jealous.
She's ordinary and you're special.
That's not true, Severus.
Gryffindor!
- Hi, I'm James.
- Hi, I'm Lily.
Just like your father.
Don't say a word against my father!
Masters shall be reunited once more!
Severus.
Don't kill me!
The prophecy did not refer to a woman.
It spoke about a boy born at the end of the July.
Yes, but it's her son!
He intends to hunt them down and kill them.
Hide him... hide them all.
I beg you!
What would you give me in exchange, Severus?
- Anything.
- Harry...
Harry, you were so loved.
So loved!
Harry, mama loves you.
Dadda loves you.
Harry, be safe.
Be strong.
Avada Kedavra!
You said you would keep her safe.
Lily and James...
put their faith in the wrong person, Severus.
Rather like you.
The boy survives.
He doesn't need protection,
the Dark Lord has gone.
The Dark Lord will return.
And when he does, the boy
will be in terrible danger!
He has her eyes.
If you truly loved her...
No one, can know.
I shall never reveal the best of you,
Severus.
Your word?
Can you risk your life every day
to protect the boy?
... He possesses no measurable talent, his arrogance rivals that of his father's and he seems to relish in his fame...
Don't tell a word against my father!
James Potter, lazy, arrogant.
- My father was a great man!
- Your father was a swine!
Drink it, it will contain the curse to
your hand, for the time being.
- It will spread, Albus.
- How long?
Maybe a year.
Don't ignore me, Severus.
We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered
the Malfoy boy to murder me.
But should he fail, I should presume
the Dark Lord will turn to you.
You must be the one to kill me, Severus.
It is the only way.
Only then, will the Dark Lord trust you completely.
There will come a time, when Harry Potter,
must be told something.
But you must wait, until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.
Must be told what?
On the night Lord Voldemort went
to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...
Then, Lily Potter cast herself between them...
...the curse rebounded.
When that happens, a part of Voldemort's soul...
latched itself onto the only living thing it could find...
Harry himself.
There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes...
There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind...
A part of Voldemort lives inside him.
So, when the time comes...
...the boy must die?
Yes... yes.
He must die.
You've kept him alive, so he can
die at the proper moment?
You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.
Don't tell me now, that you've
grown to care for the boy.
Expecto Patronum
Lily!
After all this time!
Always.
So, when the time comes...
...the boy must die?
Yes.
He must die.
And Voldemort himself must do it.
That is essential.
- Where've you been?
- I thought you went to the forest.
I'm going there now.
Are you mad?
No...
You can't give yourself up to him.
What is it, Harry?
What is it you know?
There is a reason I can hear them.
The Horcruxes.
I think I've known for a while.
And I think you have, too.
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.
Kill the snake, and it's just him!
I'm ready to die.
Resurrection Stone.
You've been so brave, sweetheart.
Why are you here?
All of you.
We never left.
Does...
Does it hurt?
Dying?
Quicker than falling asleep.
You're nearly there, son.
I'm sorry.
I never wanted any of you to die for me.
And, Remus, your son?
Others will tell him what his
mother and father died for.
One day, he'll understand.
You'll stay with me?
Until the end.
And he won't be able to see you?
No.
We're here, you see.
Stay close to me.
Always.
No sign of him, My Lord.
I thought he'd come.
Harry, no!
- What're yeh doin' 'ere?
- Quiet!
Harry Potter...
...The Boy Who Lived...
...come to die.
Avada Kedavra
You can't help...
Harry, you're a wonderful boy...
You brave, brave man!
Let us walk.
Professor, what is that?
Something beyond either of our help.
A part of Voldemort sent here to die.
And exactly where are we?
I was gonna ask you that.
Where would you say where we are?
Well, it looks like King's Cross station.
Only cleaner...
....and without all the trains.
King's Cross, is that right?
This is as they say, 'your' party.
I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort...
...have been connected by something other than fate.
Since that night at Godric's Hollow all those years ago.
So it's true then, sir.
A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?
Did.
It's been just destroyed many moments
ago by none other than Voldemort himself.
You, were the Horcrux he
never meant to make, Harry.
- I have to go back, haven't I?
- Oh, that's up to you.
- I've a choice?
- Oh, yeah!
We're in King's Cross, you say.
I think if so decide,
you'll be able to board a train.
And where will it take me?
On.
Voldemort has the Elder Wand?
True.
And the snake is still alive?
Yes.
And I've nothing to kill it with?
Help will always be given at Hogwarts, Harry.
To those who ask for it.
I've always pride of myself
on my ability to turn a phrase.
Words are, in my not so humble opinion...
..almost inexhaustible source of magic.
Capable of inflicting
injury and remedies.
But I would in this case...
amend my original statement to this:
Help, will always be given at Hogwarts,
To those who deserve it.
Do not pity the dead, Harry...
Pity the living.
And above all...
....all those who live without love.
Professor, my mother's Patronus...
was a doe, wasn't it?
As the same as Professor Snape's.
It's curious, don't you think?
Actually, if I think about it...
...it doesn't seem curious at all!
I'll be going now, Harry.
Professor?
Is this all real?
Or is it just happening inside my head?
Of course it's happening
inside your head, Harry.
Why should that mean, that it's not real?
Professor?
What should I do?
Professor!
My Lord, My Lord...
Are you hurt?
I don't need your help.
The boy...
Is he dead?
Is he alive?
Draco, is he alive?
Dead.
Who is that?
Hagrid's carrying?
Neville, who is it?
Harry Potter...
... is dead!
- No!
No!
Silence!
Stupid girl!
Harry Potter...
is dead!
From this day forth...
...you'll put your faith in me.
Harry Potter is dead!
And now it's the time to declare yourself.
Come forward and join us...
or die!
Draco!
Draco.
Draco.
Come.
Well done, Draco.
Well done!
Well, I must say I'd hope for better.
And who might you be, young man?
Neville Longbottom.
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can
find a place for you in our rank.
I'd like to say something.
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be
fascinated to hear what you have to say.
- Doesn't matter that Harry is gone.
- Stand down, Neville!
People die everyday!
Friends, family.
Yeah...
We lost Harry tonight.
He's still with us.
In here.
So as Fred, Remus...
Tonks...
All of them.
They didn't die in vain.
But you will.
Because you're wrong!
Harry's heart did beat for us.
For all of us!
It's not over!
Confringo
Come on!
All remain into the castle.
We have to kill the snake.
Hey, Neville!
Not my daughter, you bitch!
Hey, you were right...
...when you told Professor Snape
that wand was failing you.
It was always fail...
I killed Snape!
Yeah, but what if the wand never belonged to Snape?
What if its allegiance has always been
with someone else?
Oh, come on, Tom...
Let's finish it the way we started.
Together!
Die!
Harry!
Why didn't it work for him?
The Elder Wand?
It answers to somebody else.
When he killed Snape, he thought
the wand would become his.
But the thing is...
The wand never belongs to Snape.
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore
that night in the Astronomy tower.
From that moment on, the wand answered him.
Until, the other night when I disarmed Draco.
At Malfoy Manor.
So, that means...
It's mine!
- What should we do with it?
- We?
Just saying, that's the Elder Wand.
The most powerful wand in the world.
With that, he'll be invincible.
Together.
- Bag?
- Yeah
Jumper?
I'm gonna miss you.
Here they come.
Dad?
What if I am put in Slytherin?
Albus Severus Potter.
You're named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts.
One of them was a Slytherin.
And he was the bravest man I've ever known.
- What you say if I am...
- Then Slytherin house...
will've gained a wonderful young wizard.
Listen...
If it really means that much to you,
you can choose Gryffindor.
The Sorting Hat takes
your choice into account.
- Really?
- Really.
- Ready?
- Ready.
