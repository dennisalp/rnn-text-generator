That's it. 100 honours, and 90 below.
Nicely done, Strangways.
I have to give it to you.
I must leave you for a few minutes.
Order a round on my chit, Professor.
Right.
Damn it all!
Must you always break off at this time?
My managing director's a creature of
habit. I get a call every day at this time.
Hurry back before the cards get cold.
Same again.
Bless you, master.
- Hurry, man! Hurry!
- Get away, quick!
W6N... W6N... W6N.
Calling G7W.
How do you hear me? Over.
Receiving you. Over.
Stand by to transmit.
Wait. Out.
Here.
Hello, W6N. Report my signals.
Report my signals. Over.
Hello, W6N. Over.
Foreman of signals - urgent.
Get me the Ml6 radio security control.
What is it?
W6N, Jamaica. Broken contact, sir,
during a routine transmission.
Broken or faded?
Broken.
The carrier wave is still established.
- And the emergency frequencies?
- No joy on either. I'm still calling.
Keep trying.
Let me know when they come up.
Hello, W6N? W6N?
Report my signals. Over.
Foreman of signals, sir.
Jamaica's broken off mid-transmission.
No, sir. It's not a technical fault.
Yes, sir.
Will you tell him, sir?
Very good.
- Excuse me, sir. Are you a member?
- No, I'm looking for Mr James Bond.
- What name should I say, sir?
- Just give him my card, will you?
Would you like to leave your coat
over there, sir?
- Suivi.
- Carte.
Sept la banque.
- Banco suivi.
- Carte.
Huit la banque.
- C'est suivi.
- Oui, madame. Changeur, s'il vous plat.
- Carte.
- Neuf la banque.
- I need another thousand.
I admire your courage, Miss... uh...?
Trench. Sylvia Trench.
I admire your luck, Mr...?
Bond.
James Bond.
Mr Bond, I suppose you wouldn't
care to... um... raise the limit?
I have no objections.
Pas possible, madame. Ce n'est pas lgal.
- C'est suivi, monsieur.
Looks like you're out to get me.
It's an idea, at that.
- Huit la banque.
Neuf la banque.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Thank you.
Andr, I must pass the shoe.
I hope you'll forgive me,
but it's most important.
Thank you.
Have those changed, will you?
Too bad you have to go.
Just as things were getting interesting.
Yes.
Tell me, Miss Trench, do you play any
other games? Besides "chemin de fer"?
Hmm. Golf,
amongst other things.
- Tomorrow afternoon, then.
- Tomorrow? Let me see...
And, uh, we could have dinner
afterwards, perhaps?
Sounds tempting.
May I, um,
let you know in the morning?
Splendid.
My number's on the card.
See if he's there, will you?
James, where on earth have you been?
I've been searching London for you!
He'll see you in a minute.
Moneypenny!
What gives?
Me. Given an ounce of encouragement.
You never take "me" to dinner
looking like this, James.
You never take me to dinner. Period.
I would, you know. Only M
would have me court-martialled for
illegal use of government property.
Flattery will get you nowhere.
But don't stop trying.
- Now...
- What's all this to-do about?
Strangways. And it looks serious.
We've been burning the air between
here and Jamaica for three hours.
Oh. In you go.
Don't forget to write.
Good evening, sir.
It happens to be 3am.
When do you sleep, 007?
Never on the firm's time, sir.
Sit down.
Jamaica went off the air tonight,
in the middle of the opening procedure.
We've checked and...
Strangways has disappeared.
So has his secretary.
A new girl. We'd only just sent her out.
Was Strangways on something... special?
He was checking
an enquiry from the Americans.
They complained about interference
with their Cape Canaveral rockets.
They think it comes
from the Jamaica area.
- Does "toppling" mean anything to you?
- A little.
It's throwing the gyroscopic controls
of a guided missile off balance with a...
a radio beam or something.
Five million dollars' worth of missile
aimed at a spot in the South Atlantic,
but finishing up in the Brazilian jungle,
is bad enough.
Now they're gonna try orbiting a rocket
round the moon.
The American CIA sent a man down
to work with Strangways.
- A fellow called Leiter. Do you know him?
- I've heard of him. Never met him.
Has he found out anything important?
Better ask "him". You're booked
on the 7 o'clock plane to Kingston.
That gives you exactly
three hours, 22 minutes.
Armourer.
You'll get a set of background papers
at the airport, in a self-destructor bag.
You can study them during the flight.
I want to know
what's happened to Strangways.
Sir.
Take off your jacket.
Give me your gun.
Yes, I thought so. This damn Beretta
again. I've told you about this before.
You tell him - for the last time.
Nice and light - in a lady's handbag.
No stopping power.
Any comments, 007?
I disagree, sir.
I've used a Beretta for ten years.
I've never missed with it yet.
Maybe not, but it jammed on your last job
and you spent six months in hospital.
A double-O number means you're
licensed to kill, not get killed.
And another thing.
Since I've been head of Ml6, there's been
a 40% drop in double-O casualties.
I want it to stay that way.
You'll carry the Walther.
Unless you'd prefer to go back
to standard intelligence duties?
No, sir. I would not.
Then from now on you carry
a different gun. Show him, armourer.
Walther PPK. 7.65mm with a delivery
like a brick through a plate-glass window.
Takes a Brausch silencer,
with little reduction in muzzle velocity.
The American CIA swear by them.
- Thank you, Major Boothroyd.
- Thank you, sir.
- Any questions, 007?
- No, sir.
All right, then. Best of luck.
Thank you, sir.
- Sir?
- Just leave the Beretta.
repartee. 007's in a hurry.
Ciao.
Good luck.
There! Now you made me miss it.
You don't miss a thing.
How did you get in here?
I decided to accept your invitation.
That was for tomorrow afternoon.
Tell me...
Do you always dress this way for golf?
I changed into something more
comfortable. I hope I did the right thing.
You did the right thing,
but you picked the wrong moment.
I have to leave immediately.
Oh, that's too bad.
Just as things were
getting interesting again.
When did you say you had to leave?
Immediately.
"Almost" immediately.
Hello, New York. Your Pan-Am 323
just landed - Kingston, Jamaica.
please go to terminal four?
Taxi!
All right, then. Go ahead.
Help yourself.
- Taxi!
- Mr... Bond, sir?
Yes?
I'm Mr Jones - chauffeur from
Government House, sent to get you.
Fine. You can drop my luggage
at the hotel on the way.
- Hang on, I want to check my reservation.
- I can do that.
No, no. You just take care of the bags.
- Yes.
- Hold the line, please.
- Who wants him?
- James Bond. Universal Exports.
Welcome to Jamaica, Mr Bond.
Yes, your head office
alerted us this morning.
- Are you free for lunch at one o'clock?
- One o'clock suits me fine.
- No, I didn't think you'd want one.
Quite right. One o'clock, then.
Forgive me if I'm... a few minutes late.
Thank you.
- Where to first, sir?
- Government House, but I'm in no hurry.
Just, uh... take me for a ride.
Do you always drive this fast?
I told you I wasn't in a hurry.
Sorry, sir, but I think there's
some fellow trying to follow us.
Then I suggest you... try and lose them.
Take the next turning on the right.
Now, Mr Jones.
Talk fast,
before your friend doubles back.
Who are you working for?
I... don't know what you're talking about.
- I was just sent to meet you at the airport.
- Ah, but by whom?
By...
- Government House.
- I don't think so.
Both hands on the wheel, Mr Jones.
I'm a very nervous passenger.
Get out - move!
Keep your hands where I can see them.
Get up!
- Now talk.
- All right.
All right.
Let me have a cigarette.
To hell with you!
Sergeant, make sure he doesn't get away.
Tut-tut-tut. Cyanide in a cigarette?
- Fantastic!
- No less.
Duff, what have you got for us?
The car was stolen and we haven't
been able to identify the driver yet.
But he surely wasn't a Kingston man.
Wherever he was from,
news of my arrival leaked.
- We didn't advertise it, I can assure you.
- Perhaps not.
I got the impression
someone had been selling tickets.
Anything more we can do for you?
I'd like to meet the last people
to see Strangways.
Nobody seems to have seen him
after he left our bridge four.
- Who were the others?
- Professor Dent...
Metallurgist, runs a test laboratory.
Respected. Clean bill.
- Potter...
- Old general. Been here for ages.
We'll start with those.
- Want them brought in?
- Lord, no! I want to meet them socially.
I can introduce you at the club tonight.
Fine.
We'll take a look at Strangways' place.
I'll run you up there now.
Go on in.
Yes, that's her blood patch.
- They've grouped it as O Rh positive.
- That's her group all right.
The set was still switched on
when we came round.
We tried to get through,
but it was dead the other end.
And it'll stay dead. All frequencies are
changed immediately security's broken.
Receipt from Dent Laboratories.
Is geology a hobby of Strangways'?
Not that I know of, no.
Who's the man with Strangways?
One of the local fishermen.
- He drove the car that tailed me.
- That gives us something to work on.
I'll have him checked.
You do that. I want to change before
I meet Pleydell-Smith at the club.
One medium-dry vodka martini -
mixed like you said, sir, and not stirred.
- Anything else, sir?
- No, that's all.
Curious, old Strangways
just vanishing like that. Or is it?
Cherchez la femme.
His secretary was very nice indeed.
Did you know her?
I've seen her around, you know?
None of you can throw any light
on what happened to him?
In his conversation? Any hint?
I only heard him talk about
big game fishing and bridge.
Fishing was the latest craze.
He got the bug three weeks ago.
He's been out every day.
It must have cost something.
These fishermen ask the earth to charter,
and Quarrel's the most expensive.
Quarrel?
A Cayman Islander.
He keeps a boat in the harbour.
I see.
- Excuse me. Where do I find Quarrel?
- He him.
Thank you.
Is your name Quarrel?
Maybe.
I'm a friend of...
Commander Strangways.
Now ain't that nice!
I like people who's friends of people.
I thought you might be able
to tell me what happened to him.
As far as I know, nothing happened.
Unless you know... different, Captain.
Where did you take him in your boat?
You see that, Captain?
That there's the Caribbean.
That's where.
Fishing.
I'm interested in fishing.
I'd like to charter your boat.
I'm sorry, Captain. It's not for hire.
It seems I came to the wrong address.
That's all right, Captain. Now, if you'll
excuse me, I got business to attend to.
Hey, Pussfeller.
Well, if it ain't my friend
what gets addresses mixed!
You got the right one,
if you likes good eating.
I do, if the... conversation matches it.
Back at the boat too public.
- In there it different.
- Well, after you.
Sure thing.
- Hey, man! See we get a bit of privacy.
- Nothing but, Quarrel. Nothing but.
- Take a seat.
- No, I'm fine.
OK, mister.
Supposing you start the conversation.
Now how's about it?
Ain't no use you struggling.
Pussfeller wrestles alligators.
Right. Up slowly and face that wall.
Hold it.
Gently, bud. Gently.
Let's not get excited.
Frisk him.
Nothing.
Interesting.
Where were you measured for this?
My tailor. Savile Row.
Is that so? Mine's a guy in Washington.
Felix Leiter. Central Intelligence Agency.
You must be James Bond.
- You mean we're fighting the same war?
- Yeah. I spotted you at the airport, but...
when you left with the opposition
I figured I must be wrong.
Quarrel's been helping me.
- No hard feelings, I hope?
- Glad to know you, Mr Bond.
Pussfeller owns the place.
- I hope he cooks better than he fights!
- Nobody died from my cooking - yet!

Cape Canaveral is screaming. ##
With this moon rocket launch,
they don't want anything to go wrong.
And Strangways didn't think
the interference came from here?
I suppose you cased the joint?
I checked - unofficially.
You Limeys can be touchy
about trespassing.
Strangways and Quarrel
checked the offshore islands.
- You found nothing?
- Not a thing.
- Where did you look?
- Just about most everywhere.
Fire Island, Crab Key, Morgan's Reef.
Checked them all?
All except Crab Key.
We didn't have no right to go there.
- Why not?
- It belongs to a Chinese...
Get her, Quarrel - and the camera.
Evening, missis.
You're hurting!
The Captain wants you
to have a drink with us.
You're hurting me!
You can't mean it.
Good evening.
Why do you want another picture of me?
Because I only got your hat at the airport.
- Tell this ape to let me go!
- Why do you want a picture at all?
Because that's the way I earn my living.
- Who pays you?
- Oh... "The Daily Gleaner"!
Pussfeller! Pussfeller!
- Anything I can do?
- Ever seen this girl before?
She come here sometimes.
She being a nuisance to you?
You want for me to get rid of her?
No. Just ring the "Gleaner". Find out
if they sent a photographer here tonight.
They didn't send me. I work freelance.
Freelance, hm? For whom?
You...!
Tell us and he'll stop.
We don't get nothing out of this gal.
You want for me to break her arm?
Another time.
The second time nothing's come out.
Give her her arm back.
Run along, Freelance.
You'll be sorry.
You'll all be sorry, you rats!
One takes cyanide, another would have
had her arm broken. Neither would talk.
- Who puts that sort of scare into people?
- I think we'd better find out, but fast.
You mentioned Crab Key.
Why can't we go over there?
It belongs to a Chinese character.
He won't allow anyone to land.
Our naval reconnaissance planes
took a look.
They only found a bauxite mine.
Low-scan CH radar setup.
Nothing illegal about that.
That Crab Key scares me plenty.
Friends of mine went out there once
after seashells.
Only trouble, they never came back again.
Local fishermen won't go near it.
Strangways and me slip in at night.
He take samples, we came straight back.
- Don't do to hang about there.
- What kind of samples?
Oh, bits of rock. Sand. Water.
I see. Crab Key begins to interest me.
What else do we know
about this Chinese gentleman?
Nothing much. Except his name.
Doctor No.
- I'd like to see Professor Dent, please.
- Have you an appointment?
James Bond.
We met yesterday at the Queen's Club.
Very well. He's somewhere in the lab.
Is Professor Dent there?
Oh, never mind. Thank you.
Morning, Professor.
Mr Bond. Anything I can do for you?
Yes. I came across this
in Strangways' office.
Your receipt.
Yes, that's right.
Can you tell me anything about it?
Poor old Strangways.
Bit of a bug of his, this amateur geology.
He brought some rock samples in for
testing, convinced they were valuable.
Were they?
No, of course not.
Just low-grade iron pyrites.
Can I see them?
Well, no, I... I threw 'em away.
- Do you know where he found them?
- No, he didn't say.
- Crab Key, perhaps?
- Definitely not.
Why so certain?
- Not geologically possible.
- Thank you, Professor.
It's kind of you to spare me your time.
You're welcome, Mr Bond.
Oh, Professor...
Allow me.
Morning.
- Take me to Crab Key.
- I can't. You know the procedure.
There's no time for procedure.
I'll take responsibility.
Man, I hope you know what you're doing.
- Come on...
- All right.
- I radioed. They're expecting me.
- Go ahead.
Sit down.
my strictest rule and come in daylight?
I had to.
Bond came to see me this morning.
be killed. Why is he still alive?
Our attempts failed.
Your attempts failed.
going to fail me again, Professor.
No. I came to warn you.
Warn me?
Tell you.
Bond discovered Strangways'
rock samples came from Crab Key.
He's not a fool.
He's sure to come out here.
If he does, I shall hold you responsible.
I make myself clear?
Yes, quite clear.
Go to the table.
You see what is in the cage?
Pick it up.
Pick it up!
Tonight.
- I'd like to send a cable.
- Yes, of course.
By the way, the car you ordered,
it's been delivered.
It's in number five parking lot.
Thank you. Good night.
Good night, Mr Bond.
- Morning, Pleydell-Smith.
- Morning, Bond.
Sorry to trouble you so early.
I need some information.
All you have on Dr No and Crab Key.
Miss Taro, bring me the files on Dr No.
Sit down.
What do you know about this island?
Not much,
except there's a bauxite mine there.
Dr No runs the place
like a concentration camp.
I've heard funny rumours,
but no-one's complained officially.
- Right, Miss Taro. Just leave them here.
- I'm very sorry, but we can't find them.
- What do you mean? Who had them last?
- Commander Strangways, sir. Both files.
All right, Miss Taro. All right.
Damn nuisance,
their disappearing like that.
On the contrary.
I'd have been surprised if they hadn't.
By the way, that came for you from
London this morning, in the plane,
in the diplomatic pouch.
A present from home.
Can I get out that way?
That's a naughty little habit -
listening at keyholes.
I wasn't listening.
I was looking for those files.
Anything that can't be found,
I get the blame.
Oh, forget it.
Actually, it's not very important anyhow.
I hate to think of you spending
all afternoon looking for them.
No. I have the afternoon off.
There's a coincidence. So have I.
Why don't you show me round the island?
What should I say to an invitation
from a strange gentleman?
You should say yes.
I should say maybe.
Three o'clock, my hotel,
maybe?
Yes, maybe.
Good.
The luminous dial activates it.
Here, hold this.
Now, where exactly did Commander
Strangways place those samples?
- About where your feet is, sir.
- Good.
- Hi, there.
- Hi.
- Lose something?
- Take a look at this Geiger reading.
Those samples Strangways brought back
from Crab Key... were radioactive.
Yet Professor Dent told me
they were worthless chunks of iron ore.
- He's either a bad professor or a poor liar.
- I intend to find out which.
Quarrel, how soon can you
get us over to Crab Key?
Well... it's like this here, Captain.
Commander Strangways,
he done take samples of "all" the islands.
- We could check the nearest ones first.
- No. I'm interested in Crab Key.
I done take the commander there.
We got away without trouble.
It don't do to tempt providence too often.
You see... there's a dragon.
- What?
- Native superstition.
Started by Dr No, probably.
We won't force you to do anything.
Leiter and I will go after dark, if you'll
give us the navigational directions.
I gets my navigational directions
from my nose, my ears,
from my instincts.
Anyway, I'll be here about seven.
Fine.
Oh, Mr Bond!
There's a telephone message for you.
Johnny, what have you done with it?
It's right here.
Hello?
Oh, Mr Bond!
I was thinking, why don't you
collect me at my apartment?
It's lovely up here in the mountains.
Nice and cool.
All right. You leave the Port Royal Road
out of Kingston,
then along the Wentworth Road,
until you get to the cement factory.
Then you turn left.
Follow the road up the hill,
down the other side,
Magenta Drive 239.
I'll be waiting for you.
How did it happen?
I think they were on their way to a funeral.
Just a minute!
You did invite me here, remember?
Oh, of course.
I just didn't expect you here so soon.
Yes, yes, come in.
Uh... I'll just go and put some clothes on.
Don't go to any trouble on my account.
Please!
Forgive me. I thought I was
invited up here to admire the view.
I feel one of us should answer it.
Hello?
Yes. Yes, I know. He's here now.
I don't know what happened.
All right. I'll try and keep him here
for a couple of hours.
I'll have to go now.
All right. I'll call you later.
You believe in living dangerously.
I can see that.
What do you mean?
Sitting around with wet hair,
you'll die of pneumonia.
- It's rather beautiful.
- Thank you.
Do you always wear it up?
- Don't you like it?
- Yes, very much.
With your sort of... face... it's wonderful.
- What's going on behind my back?
- Nothing.
Look - no hands.
I'm hungry.
Let's go out and eat.
- I'll make you a Chinese dinner here.
- No. I'm feeling Italian and musical.
- Let's go to the Blue Mountain Grill.
- I'd rather stay here.
It's more fun...
alone.
But I don't want you
getting dishpan hands.
- I like cooking.
- Forget it. May I use your phone?
Who are you ringing?
Taxi.
James Bond here. Can I have a car
sent to... 2171 Magenta Drive?
As soon as you can, please. Thank you.
I thought you came by car.
Damn thing wouldn't start. Engine trouble.
That explains...
Explains what?
Why you need a taxi.
Why I need a taxi?
Careful - my nail varnish!
- The lights.
- No, no, I always leave them on.
What's... What's going on?!
Forgive me. Book her, Superintendent,
will you? And, uh...
be careful of her nail varnish.

Drop it, Professor! I'm behind you!
I thought you'd turn up sooner or later.
Sit down.
The girl talked?
But of course.
I was suspicious
at the Queen's Club anyhow
when it turned out you were the only one
who'd seen Strangways' new secretary.
Then later, at the lab,
you made no reference to the fact that
Strangways' samples were radioactive.
Very clever, Mr Bond.
But you're up against
more than you know.
Shoot me and you'll end up
like Strangways.
- Then you killed him?
- He was killed, but never mind how.
Who are you working for, Professor?
I'll tell you, as you won't live to use
the information. I'm working for...
It's a Smith & Wesson.
And you've had your six.
Better late than never.
- Everything ready?
- Yeah, for the last two hours.
Everything's going to be fine.
Bottom part of where my belly used to be
tells me different.
For me, Crab Key will be
a gentle relaxation.
From what? Dames?
No, from being a clay pigeon.
This is as far as we can go
with the engine.
Make with paddle and wind
from now on in.
OK.
Let me go with him.
No, we settled that. Anyhow, it's my beat.
But it's my head in the noose
if anything gets unstuck.
Canaveral can only wait 48 hours
for that moonshot.
We'll be back in 12.
If not, then it's your beat.
You'd better bring your Marines with you.
Hey, Quarrel, if you see a dragon,
get in first and breathe on him, you hear?
With all that rum in you, he'll die happy!
Better drop the sail
in case their radar's on scan.
Hard about, Captain... now!
Cover it up.
We'd better get some sleep
before it gets light.
I'll be down this end.

It's all right.
I'm not supposed to be here, either.
I take it you're not. Are you alone?
What are "you" doing here?
Looking for shells?
No. I'm just looking.
Stay where you are.
I promise I won't steal your shells.
I promise you you won't, either.
Stay where you are!
I can assure you,
my intentions are strictly honourable.
What's your name?
Ryder.
Ryder what?
Honey... Ryder.
- What's so funny about it?
- Nothing. It's a very pretty name.
What's your name?
James.
Honey, did you use your sail
all the way up to the reef here?
Of course. I always do.
Then they'll know we're here.
They have radar.
Oh, my boat is too small to be noticed.
And I often come here to get the shells.
At first they used to try to catch me,
but they couldn't.
- Now I don't think they bother any more.
- They will this time.
- Don't bother with those now.
- Don't bother?
Are they valuable?
This one is worth $50 in Miami.
You promise you won't tell anyone?
I promise.
- Hey! Come and take a look!
- He's with me.
Captain, what do you think of that!
What's the matter?
That's a high-powered boat.
Take some cover! Come on!
They're here all right.
OK, folks!
Come out and you won't get hurt!
Stand up and show yourselves
or I'll be forced to open fire!
Come on out!
We know you're there!
We've been expecting you!
Just walk out with your hands up
and you'll be OK!
This is your last chance!
He's bluffing. Keep down.
All right. You've been warned!
This is it!
Lie still. It won't last long.
They don't know we're here.
Fire!
Are you coming out?
All right, then.
We'll be back.
We'll be back with the dogs!
Full speed ahead!
I told you this place was wrong.
- That was a machine gun, not a dragon.
- There's a dragon here, too.
She's right.
- You've seen it, hm?
- Yes, I have.
He had two glaring eyes,
a short tail and pointed wings.
He was breathing fire.
You don't believe me, do you?
Little gal, I does.
Let's get the hell outta here.
Listen, both of you.
There are no such things as dragons.
What you saw was something that looked
like one. I'm trying to think what it was.
How do you know there aren't?
What do you know about animals?
Did you ever see a mongoose dance?
A scorpion with sunstroke
sting itself to death?
Or a praying mantis
eat her husband after making love?
- I hate to admit it, but I haven't.
- Well, I have.
She's right.
All right, they've gone.
Honey, you're getting out of here.
I'm getting out when I'm ready.
That's never in daylight.
This time you are, and fast.
Where's your boat?
Fetch my shoes.
Look! Look what they've done!
It's all your fault!
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new boat
when we get back to Kingston.
What are we going to do with her now?
If you like,
I know a good place where we can hide.
That'll do for a start.
Leave the things you don't need.
All right, all right.
- Must we come this way?
- Yes. It throws the dogs off the scent.
- Damn mosquitoes!
- Rub water all over yourself.
It's the salt they're after.
Hey...! Quick! They's coming!
Across there!
Quarrel, cut some of those reeds.
Give me the knife.
Over there.
They're coming closer.
- Aiee!
- Keep quiet.
Something's biting me!
If you disturb the mud,
they'll know we've been here.
- Looks like they're onto something.
- Sh!
Ssh!
Get down, get down!
- Why?
- Because I had to.
That guy sure knew his business,
trailing us after we let the others pass.
Where is this hiding place of yours?
Up there.
Come on.
You smell nicer already.
Oh, thank you.
Mr Bond! Quick!
- What is it now?
- Look at these!
Those are dragon tracks!
Look! That's where he breathed!
Captain, you ought to get some rest
if you wants to.
I stay out here... on watch...
in case he comes a-looking for us.
Right, and I'll take the second watch.
We'll be out of here by midnight.
I never met a detective before.
Are you going to arrest Dr No?
Someone is. We can't have him trying
to kill everyone who comes here.
He doesn't just try.
- Mm?
- I'm pretty sure he killed my father.
What?
You see,
my father was a marine zoologist.
We came to the Caribbean
for him to study seashells.
One day he came to Crab Key...
...and I never saw him again.
They said he must have drowned,
but he was too good a diver
for that to happen to him.
Didn't the police investigate?
And your family?
They investigated for a long time.
Then they said
"Missing, presumed dead".
I haven't got any family.
There was only my father and me.
You're here all alone?
Where did you live before?
All over the world.
The Philippines, Bali, Hawaii.
Anywhere there were shells.
You went to school "somewhere"?
I didn't need to. We had an encyclopedia.
I started at A when I was eight,
and now I've reached T.
I bet I know a lot more things than you do.
Didn't anyone in Kingston help?
Well... there was this man who owned
the place where we were living.
He let me stay on
for a while without paying.
Then one night he came up to my room...
Well, you know.
I scratched his face, and then...
But he was stronger than I was.
What happened after that?
I put a black-widow spider
underneath his mosquito net.
A female, and they're the worst.
It took him a whole week to die.
Did I do wrong?
Well, it wouldn't do to make a habit of it.
Do you have a woman of your own?
Captain, quick! Down here!
Whatever's coming, it's coming this way!
This time I want to see it.
And hurry!
There's less than 12 hours to go!
Stay where you are!
All of you! Stay right where you are!
OK, Captain.
If that ain't a dragon, what is it?
A dragon that runs on diesel.
Forget the spooks, Quarrel. You take the
driver. I'll take the headlights and tyres.
You keep safe out of sight.
Come on.
I told you to stay there!
- I was frightened.
- Get down!
Come on out!
Hands where we can see 'em!
And the dame! Quick!
Unless you want an extra navel.
Hold it. Drop that gun.
Now kick it away from you.
The girl will stay where she is.
Now walk towards me, hands out in front.
Come on!
Hey, you!
Where do you think you're going!
Sorry we ain't got any flowers.
Come on, let's go.
Come on. Come on, let's go!
Give me that knife.
Leave him alone!
- Leave him alone!
- Get out of the way!
Get inside!
Keep an eye on the man.
And be careful. They've been
in the swamp and they're contaminated.
Check their Geiger reading.
He's reading 95, Chief.
She's 88.
Too much for the monitor.
Scrub them down, but quick!
Do another reading.
- Reading 72.8.
- The mud's soaked into their clothes.
All right, then. Take off all their clothes.
- What's he going to do?
- Do as he says. We're contaminated.
- Do the girl first.
- We give the orders around here.
Fine, but do something about this.
Come here, you. Here.
Use the high-temperature jets.
Full pressure.
- She's reading 47.
- All right. Put the man through.
He's now clocking 40.
Stages three and five.
Reading 38.
- Down to 8.
- Hold the girl.
He's now 18.
He's now at 8.
- She's clear.
- Good. Get the man ready.
He's got a count of four.
- Check his fingernails.
- Put your hands in there.
He's OK.
I will notify reception
they're coming through.
Decontamination here.
They're coming through.
Come in.
Come in!
Come in... you poor dears.
We simply didn't know
when to expect you.
First it was teatime yesterday,
and then dinner.
It was only half an hour ago
we knew you were on your way.
Cigarette? American, English, or Turkish?
I'm Sister Rose. This is Sister Lily. We'll
make your stay as pleasant as possible.
That's most kind of you, but...
Oh, you'll want to see your rooms!
Breakfast is ready,
and then you'll want to sleep.
The doctor left strict orders you're
not to be disturbed until this evening.
He'll be delighted
if you join him for dinner.
- Will you be there?
- Tell him I also will be delighted.
Splendid. I know he'll be pleased.
Here we are.
This will be your room, Mr Bond.
This is your bathroom in here.
And for you, young lady,
this is your room.
You'll find fresh clothes in here.
I hope they fit.
We didn't get your sizes till last night.
Don't hesitate to ring
if there's anything you want.
Such as two air tickets to London?
I'll leave you two dear people in peace.
- Well, let's have some breakfast.
- How can you eat at a time like this?
I'm hungry. We don't know when
we'll get the chance to eat again.
Here, take this.
Careful. The whole place
is probably wired for sound.
Have you...
Have you any idea
what they'll do with us?
No idea.
No door handles or windows, either.
It's a prison, then.
Mink-lined with first-class service.
What's the matter?
I don't feel so good.
I feel so sleepy.
Damn coffee!
How do you feel?
Sleepy.
What made us pass out like that?
The coffee was drugged.
It's time for dinner.
We don't want to keep the doctor waiting.
That would never do. Ready, Honey?
I suppose so.
You're doing fine.
Come on.
Am I properly dressed for the occasion?
- Quite suitable.
- Suitable for what?
This way, please.
I'm glad your hands are sweating, too.
Of course I'm scared, too.
Be natural and leave all the talking to me.
In here, please.
I hope you enjoy your dinner.
Come and look!
Artificial light. We could be
hundreds of feet beneath the sea.
Look at that. Sea tulips.
They do not grow above 200ft.
One million dollars, Mr Bond.
You were wondering what it cost.
As a matter of fact, I was.
Forgive my not shaking hands.
It's awkward with these. A misfortune.
You were admiring my aquarium.
Yes. It's quite impressive.
A unique feat of engineering,
if I may say so. I designed it myself.
The glass is convex, ten inches thick,
which accounts for the magnifying effect.
Minnows pretending they're whales.
Just like you on this island, Dr No.
It depends, Mr Bond,
on which side of the glass you are.
A medium dry martini, lemon peel,
shaken, not stirred.
- Vodka?
- Of course.
We'll have dinner at once.
There's so much to discuss. So little time.
Well, Dr No, you haven't done badly,
considering.
A handicap is what you make of it.
I was the unwanted child
of a German missionary
and a Chinese girl of good family.
Yet I became treasurer of the most
powerful criminal society in China.
It's rare for the Tongs to trust anyone
who isn't completely Chinese.
I doubt they shall do so again.
I escaped to America
with ten million of their dollars in gold.
That's how you financed this operation.
A good idea to use atomic power.
I'm glad you can handle it properly.
I'd hate to think your decontamination
chamber wasn't effective.
My work has given me
a unique knowledge of radioactivity,
but not without costs, as you see.
Yes.
Your power source had
our organisation puzzled for some time.
They are still puzzled, Mr Bond.
Not any longer. I sent a complete report.
You've not contacted your headquarters
since you requested a Geiger counter.
But there are so many files
open on you already, Dr No.
Our own, the CIA's...
The one from the Tong society
that you robbed.
When trouble comes, you'll find
this is a small and naked island.
An expendable island.
When my mission is accomplished,
I'll destroy it and move on.
But the habit of enquiry is consistent.
I see you're wondering why, where, when.
I gratify your curiosity
because you're the one man
capable of appreciating what I've done
and keeping it to himself.
Just a minute. There's no point
in involving the girl at this stage.
Let her go free. She'll promise not to talk.
- No, I'm staying with you.
- I don't want you here.
I agree. This is no place for the girl.
Take her away.
No!
No!
- I'm sure the guards will amuse her.
- Let me go! No!
That's a Dom Prignon '55.
It would be a pity to break it.
I prefer the '53 myself.
Clumsy effort, Mr Bond.
You disappoint me.
I'm not a fool,
so please do not treat me as one.
And that table knife, please put it back.
Well, we can't all be geniuses, can we?
Does the toppling of American missiles
really compensate for having no hands?
Missiles are only the first step
to prove our power.
"Our" power? Your disregard for human life
means you must be working for the East.
East, West - just points of the compass,
each as stupid as the other.
I'm a member of SPECTRE.
- SPECTRE?
- SPECTRE.
Special Executive for Counterintelligence,
Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion.
The four cornerstones of power, headed
by the greatest brains in the world.
Correction. "Criminal" brains.
The successful criminal brain
is always superior. It has to be.
Well, why become criminal?
I'm sure the West would welcome
a scientist of your... calibre.
The Americans are fools.
I offered my services. They refused.
So did the East.
Now they can both pay for their mistake.
World domination. That same old dream.
Our asylums are full of people
who think they're Napoleon... or God.
You persist in trying to provoke me,
Mr Bond.
- I could've had you killed in the swamp.
- And why didn't you?
I thought you less stupid.
Usually, when a man gets in my way...
But you were different.
You cost me time, money,
effort. You damaged my organisation
and my pride.
I was curious to see
what kind of a man you were.
I thought there might be a place
for you with SPECTRE.
I'm flattered.
I'd prefer the revenge department.
My first job would be finding the man
who killed Strangways and Quarrel.
I misjudged you.
You are just a stupid policeman
whose luck has run out.
They're waiting for you
in the control room, Dr No.
No hurry. They won't have started
their countdown check yet.
You won't get away with it, Dr No. The
Americans are prepared for any trouble.
I never fail, Mr Bond.
What do we do with him?
Soften him up.
I haven't finished with him yet.
Aagh!
Have you got new fuel elements loaded?
All ready, sir.

Where's the girl
they brought in with me?
- Number twelve.
- Show me.
We've run out of fuel.
What are we going to do now?
Well, we can swim, or, er...
Or what?
Come here.
Ahoy, Mr Bond! Ahoy, Mr Bond!
Well, well! What's the matter?
Do you need help?
I'm quite sure "you" don't.
Now that you're here,
you'd better give us a tow.
Throw us your line.
Exactly 1 minute 52 seconds.
That's excellent.
Check.
Knight takes bishop.
Knight... takes bishop.
King to rook two.
King... to rook two.
Queen to king four.
Queen... to king four.
My congratulations, sir. A brilliant coup.
Siamese fighting fish.
Fascinating creatures.
Brave, but on the whole stupid.
Yes, they're stupid.
Except for the occasional one...
...such as we have here.
He lets the other two fight...
...while he waits.
Waits until the survivor is so exhausted
that he cannot defend himself.
And then, like SPECTRE, he strikes.
I find the parallel amusing.
Our organisation did not arrange
for you to come over...
...from the Russians just for amusement,
Number Three.
Come in, Kronsteen.
Sit down, Number Three, while we listen
to what Number Five has devised for us.
I hope his efforts as director of planning
continue to be as successful as his chess.
They will be.
According to your instructions,
I've planned for SPECTRE...
...to steal from the Russians
their new Lektor decoding machine.
We need the services
of a female member...
...of the Russian Cryptograph Section
in Turkey...
...and... the help of
the British Secret Service.
Neither the Russians
nor the British will be aware...
...that they are now working for us.
Number Three, is your section ready
to carry out Kronsteen's directives?
Yes, Number One. The operation will be
organised according to Kronsteen's plan.
I have selected a suitable girl
from the Russian Consulate in Istanbul.
She's capable, cooperative...
...and her loyalty to the state
is beyond question.
You're sure she believes you're still...
...head of operations
for Soviet Intelligence?
It is most unlikely she would know
I'm now working for SPECTRE.
Moscow kept my defection secret from
all but a few members of the presidium.
For your sake, I hope so.
Kronsteen, you're sure...
...this plan is foolproof?
Yes, it is. Because I have anticipated
every possible variation of countermove.
But what makes you think that M,
the head of British Intelligence...
...will oblige you
by falling in with your plan?
Because this is so obviously a trap.
My reading of the British mentality is that
they always treat a trap as a challenge.
And they couldn't possibly
pass up even the slightest chance...
...of getting their hands
on the Lektor decoder.
They have wanted one for years.
All that you say could be true.
What else?
As an added refinement, I think
SPECTRE would have the chance...
...of a personal revenge
for the killing of our operative... Dr No.
Because the man the British will almost
certainly use on a mission of this sort...
...would be their agent James Bond.
Let his death be a particularly
unpleasant and humiliating one.
Good.
I shall put my plan
into operation straight away.
And there will be no failure.
Hurry!
Welcome to SPECTRE Island.
I hope you had a pleasant flight.
My time is limited.
Is the man I requested ready?
- His dossier.
- Good.
Donald Grant, convicted murderer.
Escaped Dartmoor Prison in 1960,
recruited in Tangier, 1962.
Excellent. Where is he now?
- At the lake.
- Bring him to my office, will you?
Take me to the lake.
Through the training area.
This Grant's one of the best men
we've ever had.
A homicidal paranoiac. Superb material,
though his methods were a little crude.
His response to our training
and indoctrination have been remarkable.
I hope our work here
meets with your approval.
Training is useful.
But there is no substitute for experience.
I agree. We use live targets as well.
- Call him!
- Grant!
He seems fit enough. Have him
report to me in Istanbul in 24 hours.
Corporal of State Security
Tatiana Romanova.
Come in.
You know who I am?
Colonel Klebb,
head of operations for... for SMERSH.
I saw you once in Moscow, when
I worked for the English decoding room.
Did you tell the consulate
you were coming here?
- No, the message...
- Yes, I know.
I sent it.
Your work record is excellent.
- The state is proud of you.
- Thank you, Comrade Colonel.
Take off your jacket.
Turn around.
You're a fine-looking girl.
Sit down.
I see you trained for the ballet.
But I grew an inch
over the regulation height and so...
And then you have had three lovers.
What is the purpose
of such an intimate question?
You're not here to ask questions!
You forget to whom you are speaking!
- I was in love.
- And if you were not in love?
I suppose that would depend...
on the man.
Sensible answer.
This man, for instance.
I cannot tell.
Perhaps if he was kind and kulturny.
Corporal, I have selected you
for a most important assignment.
Its purpose is to give
false information to the enemy.
If you complete it successfully,
you will be promoted.
From now on,
you will do anything he says.
And if I refuse?
Then you will not leave this room alive.
I will obey your orders.
Good. Now, these are your instructions.
You report to me here...
...but the consulate security man
must not know that I'm in Istanbul.
- This is classified far above his level.
- I will say nothing to anyone.
If you do, you will be shot!
Come, come, my dear.
You're very fortunate to have been chosen
for such a simple, delightful duty.
A real labour of love...
...as we say.
- Great sport, this!
- What did you say?
I said it's great sport, this punting.
I couldn't agree with him more.
I may even give up golf for it.
Really?
Not quite.
Souvenir from another jealous woman?
Yes. But I haven't turned
my back on one since.
- Excuse me.
- What?
- Give me my shirt, will you?
- What's going on?
- I have to make a phone call.
- But we haven't eaten yet.
I'm starving.
Come in, Univex. James Bond here. Over.
He's been asking for you all morning.
Where in the world are you, James?
Well, I've just been reviewing an old case.
- Oh, so I'm an old case now, am I?
- Ssh! It's the office.
- Tell him I'm on my way, will you?
- He is not on his way.
Sylvia, behave! We'll do this again
some other time soon.
Do what? Last time you said that,
you went off to Jamaica.
I haven't seen you for six months!
- I'll be there in an hour.
- I'll tell him.
Hey, your old case
sounds interesting, James.
Make that an hour and a half.
Now, about that lunch.
For my next miracle, I...
It'll be a miracle if he can explain
where he's been all day.
But I've never even heard
of a Tatiana Romanova.
- Ridiculous, isn't it?
- It's absolutely crazy.
Of course, girls do fall in love
with pictures of film stars.
But not a Russian cipher clerk
with a file photo of a British agent!
Unless she's mental.
No, it's some sort of trap.
Well, obviously. And the bait
is a cipher machine. A brand new Lektor.
A Lektor, no less.
The CIA's been after one for years.
Yes, so have we.
When she contacted Kerim Bey,
head of Station T, Turkey...
...and told him she wanted to defect,
she said she'd turn it over to us.
On one condition.
That you went out to Istanbul and brought
her and the machine back to England.
Here's a snapshot
Kerim managed to get of her.
Well, I don't know too much
about cryptography, sir...
...but, a Lektor could decode
their top secret signals.
The whole thing's so fantastic
it just could be... true.
That had occurred to me.
Besides, the Russians haven't
been up to any tricks recently.
Well, really, I'm not
too busy at the moment, sir.
You're booked on the 8:30 plane
in the morning.
If there's any chance of getting a Lektor,
we must look into it.
Suppose when she meets me in the flesh
I don't come up to expectations?
Just see that you do.
Miss Moneypenny, ask
the equipment officer to come in, please.
Q Branch has put together
a smart-looking piece of luggage.
We're issuing this
to all double-0 personnel.
An ordinary black leather case...
...with 20 rounds of ammunition,
here and here.
If you take the top off,
you'll find the ammunition inside.
In the side here, flat throwing knife.
Press that button there,
and out she comes.
Inside the case,
you'll find an AR7 folding sniper's rifle.
.25 calibre,
with an infrared telescopic sight.
If you pull out these straps,
inside are 50 gold sovereigns.
Now, watch very carefully.
An ordinary tin of talcum powder.
Inside, a tear-gas cartridge.
That goes in the case
against the side here, like that.
It's magnetised, so it won't fall.
Shut the case.
Normally, to open a case like that...
...you move the catches to the side.
If you do, the cartridge will explode...
in your face.
To stop the cartridge exploding...
...turn the catches horizontally.
Like that. Then... open normally.
Now you try it.
- Turn the catches... like that.
- That's right.
And open ordinarily.
- You got it?
- Yes, I think so.
- Is that all, sir?
- Yes, thanks very much.
That's a nasty little Christmas present.
But I shouldn't think
I'll need it on this assignment.
All the same, take it with you.
Good luck, 007.
Thank you, sir.
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends.
And one plane ticket. Lucky man.
I've never been to Istanbul.
- You've never been to Istanbul?
- No.
Where the moonlight on the Bosphorus
is irresistible?
Maybe I should get you
to take me there someday.
I've tried everything else.
Darling Moneypenny, you know
I never even look at another woman.
Oh, really, James?
Let me tell you
the secret of the world.
Miss Moneypenny,
ask 007 to leave the photograph.
I'm sure he'll recognise the lady
when he sees her.
Good luck.
Hello, London.
Your flight PA1 just landed Istanbul.
Mr. Bond?
- Kerim Bey sent a car for you, sir.
- Fine.
- Can I borrow a match?
- I use a lighter.
- It's better still.
- Until they go wrong.
- Exactly.
- I'll get the car, sir.
Kerim Bey suggested you see him
before going to the hotel.
- Would that be convenient?
- Fine.
I suppose it's customary
to have people tailing you in these parts.
Oh, yes, sir.
Today it's Citroen H 31854 on duty.
They're Bulgarians
working for the Russians.
They follow us, we follow them.
It's a sort of understanding we have.
That's very friendly.
My friend! Come in, come in!
Glad to see you. Welcome to Istanbul.
Well, thank you for sending the car.
But it does rather tie you in with me.
You're in the Balkans now, Mr. Bond.
The game with the Russians
is played differently here.
For day-to-day routine matters, we make
it easy to keep a tab on each other.
So I gathered from your chauffeur.
He's a rather intelligent young man.
He should be. He's my son.
- Coffee?
- Medium sweet.
Two medium sweet.
He also is my son.
All of my key employees are my sons.
Blood is the best security in this business.
You must have quite an establishment.
Biggest family payroll in Turkey.
Not bad for a man who started life
breaking chains and bending bars
in a circus.
But let's talk about this business of yours.
Well, M thinks I'm wasting my time here.
And so do I.
This is an old friend of mine.
- And it tells me something smells.
- Maybe.
But if there's a chance
of getting a Lektor...
Now you tell me,
where can I contact this girl?
She said she would make her own
arrangements. You'll have to wait.
Thank you.
My friend, if you really want my advice...
...you should spend a few pleasant days
with us here in Istanbul, and then...
...then go home.
- James Bond, I have a reservation.
- Mr. Bond, your room is ready.
Number 32.
- 32 for Mr. Bond.
- Hope you enjoy your stay.
Thank you.
- Will there be anything else, sir?
- Only this.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
- Mr. Bond here.
- Yes?
- The room won't do.
- I'm sorry.
The bed's too small.
One moment, sir.
Did you hear that?
Tell him that's all there is.
Unless he would like the bridal suite.
I'm sorry, sir. That's all we have available.
Except the bridal suite.
Well, let's have a look at it. I may like it.
The porter will show it to you.
He will be up immediately.
Good.
Good work. Who can the Russians
suspect but the British?
The Cold War in Istanbul
will not remain cold very much longer.
Ali Kerim Bey.
Ali Kerim Bey.
Ali Kerim Bey...
You are not glad to see me
this morning, chri?
Overjoyed.
I...
I no longer please you?
Be still!
Back to the salt mines.
Careful with those papers.
Well, who won?
I had visitors.
Limpet mine on the wall outside.
Timed to catch me at my desk.
But, by good fortune, I was relaxing
on the settee for a few moments.
- The girl left in hysterics.
- Found your technique too violent?
I cannot understand
this sudden breach of the truce.
It's unlike the Russians
to break the peace this way.
Most inconsiderate. I think my visit
might have something to do with it.
Let's try and find out.
Close up afterwards.
Quite a place you've got here.
The Emperor Constantine built it
as a reservoir... 1,600 years ago.
Really?
Here.
My daily exercise.
At eleven in the morning
and three in the afternoon.
Tie her up, will you?
Mind your head now.
Underneath the Russian Consulate.
A present from your navy.
Our friends were evicted while the Public
Works Ministry conducted a survey.
The story was that
the traffic shook the foundations.
By the time the place was declared safe,
I had this installed.
I can see everything
M said about you is right.
Know why I stay in this mad business?
It could be that you find
selling rugs a bore.
My friend, you should be a mind-reader.
Head of the table is General Vassili.
Director of Military Intelligence.
On his left, Koslovski. Chief of Security.
Opposite him, Benz. One of his agents.
I can't see the face of the other man.
The one the general is shouting at.
He's giving him a hell of a blowing up.
It's too bad
we can't hear as well as see.
Tell me, does our girl Romanova
ever come to this room?
Sometimes, with messages.
I can see the face of the other man now.
Krilencu!
So he's back.
Another Bulgarian they use as a killer.
Just the man for the limpet mine job.
I've had trouble with him before.
But he's stayed out of Istanbul
for over a year now.
Take a look. You should remember him.
This man kills for pleasure.
Nice face.
Just a moment. A girl's just come in.
Probably Romanova.
She's the only one who's allowed to.
How does she look to you?
Well, from this angle...
...things are shaping up nicely.
I'd like to see her in the flesh.
Yes.
- Could you get me a plan of that place?
- I wish I could.
The original drawing
must be registered somewhere.
I'll get onto that.
Now, I need a little time
to deal with this stinking Krilencu.
It will be better if you didn't stay
at the hotel tonight. Come!
I see now why you keep the Rolls.
One of my sons is driving it.
With two dummies in the back.
In the opposite direction.
They'll follow it for hours.
You'll like my Gypsy friends.
I use them like
the Russians use the Bulgars.
It's created a blood feud between them.
Hello, Krilencu?
We've come on the wrong night.
Two girls who love the same man
want to kill each other.
It must be settled the Gypsy way.
As I'm a family friend,
we'll be allowed to stay.
We're bidden to table.
I hope you can eat with your fingers.
Kerim Bey!
Raki! Filthy stuff!
Quick!
Tell our host
his hospitality overwhelms me.
Thank you, thank you!
No matter what happens now,
say and do nothing.
He's asking whether they will cease
their blood feud and give up this fight.
The tribe elders will decide
who will marry the chief's son.
- She's saying...
Thank you!
- Did you get Krilencu?
- No.
Just a minute. Here! Thank you.
You fought well.
I am nothing but a clumsy old man.
They're making one
of the wounded Bulgars talk.
It was me they were after.
Why would they want me out of the way?
Tomorrow we will have to find
Krilencu's hide-out.
Meantime, I'll take care of this filthy stuff.
Vavra thanks you for saving his life.
You are now his son.
Thank you. I'd like to ask him a favour.
Could he stop the girl fight?
He says your heart is too soft
to be a real Gypsy.
But he lets you decide the matter.
As if I didn't have enough problems.
Vavra said for you to decide.
So decide! They're both yours!
This might take some time.
Did you pick up that package at the hotel?
It's on the seat.
Thank you.
Twice that Krilencu has tried to kill me.
The third time he will succeed.
Unless I get him first.
- And that I'll do tonight.
- Not with that arm you won't.
You'd better leave it to me.
I'm already too much in your debt.
How can a friend be in debt?
Here.
Infrared lens.
My sons.
They will ring his doorbell.
He has a private escape hatch.
Try this for size.
- Do you notice anything?
- Not yet.
She has a lovely mouth, that Anita.
Yes. I see what you mean.
Arm or no arm, I have to pull that trigger.
If you think you can.
You've got one shot, remember.
It'll have to do.
Quick, he's coming.
Quick!
That pays many debts.
She should have kept her mouth shut.
Hello?
Breakfast for one at nine please.
Green figs, yogurt, coffee, very black.
Thank you.
You look surprised.
I thought you were expecting me.
So you are Tatiana Romanova?
My friends call me Tania.
Mine call me James Bond.
Well, now that we've been
properly introduced...
Careful! Guns upset me.
I'm sorry. I'm a bit upset myself.
You look just like your... your photograph.
You're one of the most
beautiful girls I've seen.
Thank you, but I think
my mouth is too big.
No, it's the right size.
For me, that is.
Yes.
Is it here?
What?
The decoding machine, Lektor.
Must we talk about it now?
Or is it at the Russian Consulate?
Yes.
Yes... I would need a plan of the place.
If you could get one, we could meet
at the Saint Sophia mosque.
- Like we were tourists.
- Why don't you ask me that
Later?
Now what are you looking for?
The scar.
You see, I know all about you...
...from your file.
You do? Well, I hope
you're not... disappointed.
I will tell you...
...in the morning.
We are now approaching the most
interesting corner of Saint Sophia.
Including these two great...
...red porphyry columns,
stolen and brought from Egypt.
In front of them...
...alabaster urn
was brought from Bergama...
...a famous historical city near Smyrna.
Dates back
from the Alexander the Great period.
About 1648, Sultan Murad IV...
...brought it from Bergama.
It was used as an ablution fountain.
It contains a thousand litres of water.
Right after the ablution fountain...
...we are going to a highly
interesting column over there...
...known for centuries
as the Saint Sophia...
...wishing column.
Tens of thousands...
...of people have wished here...
...putting their right hand...
...and middle finger in the hole...
I promise you,
it wasn't one of my men who killed him.
He didn't die of old age.
All I know is that it saved me the job.
Once he'd seen the girl, she was
obviously compromised, and so...
And he wasn't killed because of that.
Let's just say that Istanbul's a rough town.
Let's see how Tania's map
compares with your architect's plans.
This is the conference room
of the Russian Consulate.
Yes, that checks.
And this here is the communication room.
That's the same.
She says she works there with the Lektor
between two and three.
How is she gonna get the machine to us?
She's leaving that to me.
She'll do anything I say.
Anything! My dear James...
You're not using this.
It all sounds too easy. We don't
even know if she's telling the truth.
- Well, I intend to find out.
- Where? In the hotel?
She won't go there again.
Says it's too dangerous.
The old game.
Give a wolf a taste, then keep him hungry.
My friend, she's got you dangling.
That doesn't matter.
- All I want is that Lektor.
- All?
Are you sure that's all you want?
Well...
Lovely view.
James, we must leave here now.
If that agent reports my meeting you...
- Don't worry. He won't.
- But you don't understand the danger!
James, look up!
Smile.
Another one. Further back.
About the machine...
That's all you are interested in. Not me.
Business first.
I know, once you have got
what you want...
I haven't got it yet.
But if you tell me about the machine...
...we won't always be
working on the company's time.
All right. What do you want to know?
Talk into this.
Answer my questions quietly, but clearly.
How large is the machine?
Like... like a typewriter.
Weight?
About ten kilos. Ina brown case.
Brown like your eyes.
Keep it technical.
Self-calibrating or manual?
Both, with an in-built compensator.
James...
- Couldn't we...
- Not now.
Talk into the camera.
- How many keys?
- Symbol or code keys?
Both.
There are 24 symbols, 16 code keys.
It is inserted in a slot and the message
comes out in a paper roll...
...from another slot on the other side.
The mechanism is...
Oh, James, James, will you make love
to me all the time in England?
Day and night.
Go on about the mechanism.
Oh, yes, the mechanism.
Once, when it was being repaired,
I saw the insides.
There were many perforated discs,
made, I think, of copper...
...with a small light...
Dushka, tell me the truth.
Am I as exciting
as all those Western girls?
Once, when I was with M in Tokyo,
we had an interesting experience.
Thank you, Miss Moneypenny.
Later, later.
Those copper discs and the light...
Oh, the light, the light.
James, come closer.
I want to whisper something.
Go on.
No, not that, the mechanism!
Miss Moneypenny,
as you're no doubt listening...
...perhaps you'd take this cable?
Text reads:
"Merchandise appears genuine, stop.
Go ahead with deal. Signed, M."
Now all I have to do
is to tell the girl the date.
- The 13th?
- The 14th.
Visas?
Visas?
- Tam.
- Thank you.
Visa, please.
Your clock, is it correct?
- Always.
- Of course.
Gregori!
Excuse me!
You did say your clock was correct?
Russian clocks are always...
- Is this the Lektor?
- Yes.
Take this. It's only tear gas.
I thought it was for tomorrow,
but today is the 13th.
This is a hell of a time to be superstitious.
Come on.
Come on, quickly.
Keep your head down.
Back inside.
This way, quickly!
Quickly, quickly!
- What's the matter?
- Benz. The Russian security man.
Come on, never mind.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Here's one of them.
And there's the other one.
Your passports.
The pictures do not do you justice.
I have rarely seen a handsomer couple.
Mr. and Mrs. David Somerset.
Your name's Caroline.
Caroline! I like that name.
We've been on a business trip.
On the way back to Derbyshire.
- To our children?
- No children.
- Not even one little boy?
- Nyet.
I like big families.
My whole life has been
a crusade for larger families.
So I heard.
- Tania!
- Yes?
Lock the door. I'll knock three times.
- I'll go see the conductor.
- Will he cooperate?
We've done business before.
He'll stop the train near the frontier,
where my sons will be waiting with a car.
We'll be there... about six o'clock.
- And the airstrip?
- 20 miles.
The plane is chartered to Athens.
You'll be in London tomorrow.
We'll drink to that in London.
We are really on our way to England.
Yes. With a lovely
two-day honeymoon before us.
Honeymoon? And I've nothing to wear!
- Your trousseau.
- Oh, James!
One moment.
Oh, no!
James! James!
Oh, look! Look!
There!
I will wear this one... in Piccadilly.
You won't.
They've just passed some new laws there.
- You're nearest.
- Oh, all right.
Charming!
Charming!
Let's go to the restaurant car
for... that drink.
Surely.
Charming!
We'll continue the fashion show later.
It's all arranged for me to stop the train.
We'll get off at the restaurant car.
At that end.
Fine. We'll meet you there at six.
Make it a little later.
There are slight complications.
One of the Russian security men - Benz.
He watches the stations. He's on the train.
But he couldn't have contacted
the consulate.
Just in case, I'll keep him company
until it's time to get off.
Perhaps you'd like me to introduce you.
Charming.
Ticket control.
Do not be alarmed, my friend. We will
make you as comfortable as possible.
Now I'm sure Commissar Benz
will have a much safer journey.
I'm not mad about his tailor, are you?
James, life in Istanbul will
never be the same without you.
See you in the restaurant car.
I've had a particularly fascinating life.
Would you like to hear about it?
You would?
- You like it?
- Yes. It does rather suit you.
I will save everything else for England.
It is four o'clock, you know.
This is not kulturny in the afternoon?
Even on a honeymoon?
Then I will... take it off.
I think we're talking
at cross purposes again.
Tania...
We'd better get dressed now.
- Why?
- It's almost six.
So?
Well, it's... it's teatime!
We'll have it in here.
- We'll have all our meals here.
- Yes, that would be splendid.
But I've arranged to meet Kerim
in the restaurant car.
You go alone. I will stay here.
My dear Mrs. Somerset, we're supposed
to be a respectable English couple.
They would certainly have tea
in the restaurant.
Now, listen...
Just do as I say, will you?
Yes, James.
But there are some English customs
- that are going to be changed.
- But of course, darling.
Do I look right, Mr. Somerset?
Yes...
Mrs. Somerset.
Mr. Somerset!
- You're the friend of Kerim Bey?
- Yes.
There's been a terrible accident.
Please come with me.
- No tea?
- Later. Keep the door locked.
They killed each other.
This must be kept quiet
until we reach Trieste.
It will be difficult.
I'm sure.
Kerim Bey was a very important man.
With many influential friends.
I'm sure they also will reward you.
I will try.
What is it?
- Kerim's dead.
- Dead?
I want the truth.
- James, you are hurting me!
- I'll do worse if you don't tell me!
You're doing this under orders, I know.
What are they?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Liar!
Even if you kill me, I can say nothing.
I did not know anything
like Kerim's death would happen.
But, when we get to England, I tell you.
Go on.
Maybe they didn't let you in on all of it,
but, whatever you do know, tell me.
- I know I love you, James. I love you.
- Just tell me.
I love you, I love you, it's true.
Sure.
Beograd! Beograd!
Excuse me!
- Can I borrow a match?
- I use a lighter.
- Better still.
- Until they go wrong.
My brother telephoned me.
Why did the train not stop?
Well, I... I have some bad news.
Your father's dead.
Who did it? Tell me.
He took care of that himself.
The other man died first.
Now, listen...
I'll need help to get across the frontier
strip between Yugoslavia and Trieste.
I want you to send
a message to M in London.
Tell him to send someone
from Station Y to meet me in Zagreb.
I will.
Good.
You'll... I think you'll want these.
- Mr. Somerset, le train part.
- Thank you.
- Ciao.
- The train is leaving!
- Nash, Captain Nash.
- Bond, travelling as Somerset.
My card.
What kept you?
I'm so sorry,
I only got M's wire an hour ago.
I busted every record getting here.
What were M's orders?
Only to contact you
and the lady on the train.
Good. Come this way.
Thank you.
This is my wife Caroline. Captain Nash.
How do you do? So pleased to meet you.
This way, Nash.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
- Been long in Yugoslavia?
- About three years.
- Interesting work?
- Yes. Sometimes.
You know how it is, old man.
You look very fit, Nash.
Yes. I try to keep in shape.
So what's our problem, sir?
I can't risk taking this
through the customs...
...at the Yugoslav-Trieste border.
No stops till then. We'll have to jump off.
Can you get us across?
Any of the opposition around?
Not in any condition to worry about.
Good. We'll make it.
I know this territory
like the back of my hand.
Do you mind if we have a bite to eat?
I've been on the go since breakfast.
Of course not.
We'll go to the restaurant car.
Go with Nash to the restaurant car.
I'll join you there in a few minutes.
Whatever you say, old man.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
There you are, old man.
I was worried
something had happened to you.
- Voil, monsieur.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
I'll have the grilled sole.
And for madam. What about you, Nash?
Yes, that sounds very nice.
Make that three of those, will you?
- Oui, monsieur.
- And a bottle of the blanc de blancs.
- Make mine chianti.
- White chianti, monsieur?
No, the red kind.
Well, enjoy your dinner, old man. I think
I've got the answer to our problems.
- Very simple, really.
- Good.
We should reach the border
in about an hour.
I'm...
...terribly sorry, Mrs. Somerset.
That was clumsy of me.
- Waiter!
- Monsieur!
Waiter!
Tout de suite, monsieur!
Excuse me. Merci.
You'll... you'll find Trieste
quite interesting.
Of course, it's not London.
Cheerio.
Cheerio.
I don't feel very well.
My head...
The lady's come over faint.
- Bring her in here.
- May I?
- Let's go next door.
- Exhaustion, I'd say.
What was it,
the stuff you put in her drink?
Chloral hydrate. Quick, but mild.
- And?
- Take it easy, 007.
My escape route's only for one.
What are you after?
The girl or the Lektor?
All right.
What is your plan?
- Explain it better on a map. All right?
- Sure.
Now, we're here, you see?
When we reach there, there's a steep
gradient, the train slows down there.
We'll block the line, make for
that main road, pick up a car... there.
A truck, in fact.
That must be about 20 miles from here...
Keep still.
All right, now get up on your knees.
Put your hands in your pockets.
Keep them there.
Red wine with fish.
That should have told me something.
You may know the right wines...
...but you're the one on your knees.
How does it feel, old man?
Old man? Is that what you chaps
in SMERSH call each other?
SMERSH?
Of course. SPECTRE.
Then it wasn't a Russian show at all.
You've been playing us off
against each other, haven't you?
Then it was SPECTRE who killed
the Russian agent in the mosque.
You?
Kerim and the other man?
And Nash?
I don't mind talking.
I get a kick out of watching
the great James Bond...
...find out what a bloody fool
he's been making of himself.
We're pros, Mr. Bond.
We sweated your recognition code
out of one of your men in Tokyo...
...before he died.
I've been keeping tabs on you.
I've been your guardian angel.
Saved your life at the Gypsy camp.
Oh, yes.
I'm much obliged.
We were keeping you alive
until you could get us the Lektor.
So you had me deliver it on a plate.
That's brilliant.
Go on. I'm fascinated.
Now that we've got it,
you and the girl are expendable.
Between here and Trieste.
Girl?
Isn't she working for SPECTRE, too?
No.
She thinks she's doing it all
for Mother Russia.
She takes her orders
from Colonel Klebb.
Rosa Klebb's Russian.
Head of operations for SMERSH.
Was.
Klebb works for SPECTRE now.
The girl doesn't know that.
Well, why kill her?
Orders.
That's only half of it, old man.
Here's a roll of film.
She'll have this in her handbag.
And on you... they'll find this letter.
It's from her,
threatening to give the film to the press...
...unless you marry her
for helping you get the Lektor.
What film?
Taken in the bridal suite at your hotel.
Something else the girl didn't know about.
Or you.
You must be a pretty sick collection
of minds to dream up a plan like that.
Can't you see the headlines?
"British agent murders beautiful
Russian spy, then commits suicide."
Tell me, which lunatic asylum
did they get you out of?
Don't make it tougher on yourself!
My orders are to kill you
and deliver the Lektor.
How I do it is my business.
It'll be slow and painful.
How much are they paying you?
What's it to you?
We'll double it.
Your word of honour?
As an English gentleman?
The first one won't kill you.
Not the second.
Not even the third.
Not till you crawl over here
and you kiss my foot.
How about a cigarette?
Not a chance.
I'll pay for it.
What with?
- Where are they?
- Up there, in my case.
You show me.
Here you are. What about that cigarette?
Throw 'em down there.
Any more in the other case?
I should imagine so. It's standard kit.
I'll have a look.
Hands back in your pockets!
Keep them there.
You won't be needing this...
...old man.
Tania! Wake up!
Wake up, or I'll leave you behind.
Tania...
...wake up or I'll leave you behind,
do you hear me?
Don't leave me. Never leave me.
Tania! This is Nash's escape route.
You understand?
We've got to get off here. Take this.
Come on.
We must get
to the other side of the train.
Under here.
Grant! Where are you?
Grant!
Excuse me.
Now don't run away.
Come on!
- Come on, or I'll leave you here!
- Stay here with me.
Sleep it off in there.
You'll feel better in the morning.
Come on, wake up.
Try and straddle the truck.
I'll get them away from here.
You hide under the truck.
Quick!
I'd say one of their aircraft is missing.
Tania!
- Here, take this, and cast the rope off.
- All right.
Where's the key?
- Where's the key?!
- In my coat. In the pocket.
All right, get out. Move.
In the boat.
Do you swim?
Here, take the wheel. This way, please.
Mind the step.
Just isn't your day, is it?
- Where are we going?
- Venice.
Take a look at that locker, will you?
Charts,
pistol, some flares.
Give me those charts.
Yes, we're here. Near Istria.
There's plenty of fuel. With a bit of luck
we'll be there by morning.
Three man were found dead on the train
at Trieste. One of them was Grant.
What have you to say, Number Five?
He was Klebb's choice.
Her people failed.
It was your plan!
They followed it implicitly!
Impossible. It was perfect.
Except for one thing.
They were dealing with Bond.
Who is Bond...
...compared with Kronsteen?
Exactly. What have you to say to that,
Number Three?
Bond is still alive and the Lektor
is not yet in our possession.
I have already negotiated
with the Russians to return it to them.
We've agreed a price. And SPECTRE
always delivers what it promises.
Our whole organisation depends
on our keeping those promises.
I warned you.
We do not tolerate failure, Number Three.
You know the penalty.
Yes, Number One.
Our rules are very simple. lf you fail...
...12 seconds. One day we must
invent a faster-working venom.
Number Three!
Yes!
I do not wish to tell the Russians
there will be another delay.
There will be no delay, Number One.
Which way are we going?
The shortest route,
which is between those two mountains
and straight along the coast.
Ahoy, Mr. Bond!
Heave to, heave to!
You're trapped, Mr. Bond.
You cannot escape!
Rifle grenade, prepare to fire.
We're coming through!
Pull over, SPECTRE Green.
Get out of the way!
Give them a warning shot.
Rifle grenade, fire!
Forward machine gun, fire!
You're firing too close.
SPECTRE Red, SPECTRE Green,
you're firing too close.
You're trying to stop them,
not to sink them!
Here, take the wheel.
Slow down.
Slow down. Slow down all boats.
Green, go alongside
while we keep you covered.
- Hands up, Mr. Bond!
- Why give up?
- Without the drums, we can go faster...
- Hand me the flare pistol.
Keep your hands up, Mr. Bond.
We're sending a boat to take you off.
There's a saying in England.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
Green, change your course! Go astern!
Change course!
All boats, throw out your ammunition!
Get rid of it! Quick!
Get rid of it!
Jump! Jump!
Don't go away.
Yes?
Thanks. Tell him to wait, will you?
And send up a porter.
Avanti!
- Permesso, signore.
- S, prego.
And also get me the British Consul.
Thank you.
Yes? Mr. Maxwell, please.
- James Bond.
- James, we will miss the plane. We will...
Hello, Paul. Bond here.
I want to thank you.
Tell the office we're on our way.
What was that?
Here, leave that! I'll take it.
Should be routine from here on in.
Not so many times...
What was that you were saying?
Hello, hello?
Klebb.
James, are you still there? Hello!
Romanova,... the door!
Take this.
Horrible woman.
Yes. She's had her kicks.
Here you are.
In case you ever need it again.
Oh, yes. All government property
has to be accounted for.
But as I said before, we won't always
work on the company's time, will we?
No.
James, behave yourself.
We are being filmed.
Oh, not again.
He was right, you know.
- What is it?
- I'll show you.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Mr Romales and his friends
will be out of business.
He won't be using heroin-flavoured
bananas to finance revolutions.
Don't go back to your hotel, seor.
They'll be watching you.
- There's a plane to Miami in an hour.
- I'll be on it, but
first I have some unfinished business
to attend to.
Forgive me.
Why do you always wear that thing?
I have a slight inferiority complex.
Where was I?
Shocking!
Positively shocking.
Goldfinger
He's the man
The man with the Midas touch
A spider's touch
Such a cold finger
Beckons you
To enter his web of sin
But don't go in
Golden words he will pour in your ear
But his lies can't disguise what you fear
For a golden girl
Knows when he's kissed her
It's the kiss of death
From Mr Goldfinger
Pretty girl
Beware of this heart of gold
This heart is cold
Golden words he will pour in your ear
But his lies can't disguise what you fear
For a golden girl
Knows when he's kissed her
It's the kiss of death
From Mr Goldfinger
Pretty girl
Beware of this heart of gold
This heart is cold
He loves only gold
Only gold
He loves gold
He loves only gold
Only gold
He loves gold
One, two, three!
Who's over there?
- How's this?
- It's nice... Very nice.
- Just here?
- No, a little lower.
I thought I'd find you in good hands.
Felix! How are you?
- Dink, meet Felix Leiter.
- Hello!
- Felix, say hello to Dink.
- Hi, Dink.
Dink, say goodbye to Felix.
Man talk.
You must be slipping, 007, letting
the opposition get that close to you.
They got a lot closer to you in Jamaica.
What's on your mind? I'm on holiday.
Not any more, you're not.
Signal from London.
I knew M wouldn't book me into
the best hotel here out of gratitude.
He asked us to keep
an eye on him for you.
Auric Goldfinger.
Sounds like a French nail varnish!
He's British. But he doesn't sound like it.
Big operator, worldwide interests.
All seem reputable.
Owns one of the finest US stud farms.
- What's the tie-up with Washington?
- He's clean.
And where do I find him?
That's his pigeon waiting for him now.
Goldfinger's been taking him
to the cleaners every day for a week.
Morning, Mr Simmons!
Ready for our little game?
Sure. When you're ten grand
in the hole, you're ready for anything.
- Could I have my usual seat?
- You and your suntan!
Goldfinger's a fabulous card player.
- Same stakes?
- Let's double it.
Five dollars a point.
- Did you say five?
- My luck's gotta change some time.
OK.
I'll get back
and cable M you're on the job.
- Fill me in on the rest at dinner.
- Fine. I'll call you later.
- Four.
- So soon?
How many?
Miss?
Hey, what are you... ?
That's Mr Goldfinger's suite!
Yes, I know.
You're very sweet.
He just drew the king of clubs.
That makes his count 59.
He's got a diamond run: eight, nine, ten.
He's holding on to the six of spades,
so I guess he thinks you want it.
That last draw was the eight of hearts.
He needs kings and queens.
- Who are you?
- Bond. James Bond.
Come on, come on!
That's more like it!
- What's your name?
- Jill.
- Jill who?
- Jill Masterson.
- Tell me, Jill. Why does he do it?
- He likes to win.
- Why do you do it?
- He pays me.
- Is that all he pays you for?
- And for being seen with him.
Just seen?
Just seen.
I'm so glad.
You're much too nice to be mixed up
in anything like this, you know.
Now hear this, Goldfinger.
Your luck has just changed.
I doubt if the Miami Beach police
would take kindly to what you're doing.
Nod your head if you agree.
Nod.
Good! Now start losing, Goldfinger.
Shall we say $10,000?
No, let's be generous.
Let's make it $1 5,000.
May I see?
Hell, I can see this is really my day!
Gin!
Over and out.
That should keep him occupied
for quite some time.
I'm beginning to like you, Mr Bond.
Call me James.
More than anyone I've met
in a long time... James.
What on earth
are we going to do about it?
- Yes. What?
- I'll tell you at dinner.
Where?
Well, I know the best place in town.
Station WEDS brings you
the latest in world news.
Washington. At the White House today,
the President said
he was entirely satisfied...
That makes two of us.
- Hello.
- Leiter here.
- Felix!
- Well, now?
What's that? Dinner?
No, look, I'm sorry.
I can't. Something big's come up.
How about breakfast?
- OK.
- Not too early.
- I'll call you around nine.
- Yes, nine o'clock will be fine.
- So long, James.
- Good night, Felix.
It's lost its chill!
- Why, you!
- There's another in the fridge.
- Who needs it?
- My dear, some things just aren't done.
Such as drinking Dom Prignon '53
above a temperature of 38?Fahrenheit.
That's as bad as listening
to the Beatles without earmuffs.
Now... where is this passion juice?
Jill?
Yes, Mr Bond?
Beach 79432. Room 1 1 9.
- Hello?
- Hello, Felix.
Get over here right away.
- What's happened?
- The girl's dead.
- Dink?
- No, Masterson. Jill Masterson.
And she's covered in paint. Gold paint.
Gold?
All over?
She died of skin suffocation.
It can happen to cabaret dancers.
You should leave a small bare patch
at the base of the spine
to allow the skin to breathe.
- Someone obviously didn't.
- And I know who.
This isn't a personal vendetta, 007.
It's an assignment like any other.
And if you can't treat it as such,
coldly and objectively,
You've hardly distinguished yourself.
You were to observe Mr Goldfinger.
Not borrow his girlfriend.
Instead, Goldfinger goes to Europe
and it's only thanks to Leiter
and my diplomatic intervention
that you're not being held
by the Miami Beach police!
Sir, I am aware of my shortcomings.
But I'm prepared to continue this
assignment in the spirit you suggest
if I knew what it was about,
sir.
What do you know about gold?
Not paint, bullion.
I know it when I see it.
Meet me here at seven.
Black tie.
What do you know about gold,
Moneypenny?
The only gold I know about
is the kind you wear.
You know, on the third finger
of your left hand.
One of these days
we really must look into that.
What about tonight?
Come round for dinner
and I'll cook you a beautiful angel cake.
Nothing would give me greater pleasure
but unfortunately I do have
a... business appointment.
That's the flimsiest excuse
you've ever given me!
Some girls have all the luck!
- Who is she, James?
- She is me, Miss Moneypenny,
and kindly omit the customary by-play
with 007. He's dining with me
and I don't want him to be late.
So there's hope for me yet?
Moneypenny...
Won't you ever believe me?
We here at the Bank of England
are the official depository
for gold bullion.
Just as Fort Knox, Kentucky,
is for the United States.
We know the amounts we each hold and
the amounts deposited in other banks.
We can estimate what is being held
for industrial purposes.
Thus, both governments can establish
the true value
of the dollar and the pound.
Consequently, we are concerned
with unauthorised leakages.
I take it you mean smuggling.
Yes.
Gold, gentlemen, which can be melted
down and recast, is all but untraceable,
which makes it, unlike diamonds,
ideal for smuggling,
attracting the biggest
and most ingenious criminals.
- Thank you, Brunskill. That'll be all.
- Thank you, sir.
Have a little more of this...
rather disappointing brandy.
- What's the matter with it?
- I'd say it was a 30-year-old Fine,
indifferently blended, sir.
With an overdose of Bons Bois.
Colonel Smithers is
giving the lecture, 007.
Gentlemen, Mr Goldfinger
has gold bullion on deposit
in Zurich, Amsterdam, Caracas
and Hong Kong-worth ?0 million.
- Most of it came from this country.
- Why move it?
The price of gold varies
from country to country.
If you buy it here at $30 an ounce,
you can sell it in, say, Pakistan at $1 10
and triple your money.
- If you have facilities for melting it down.
- And has he?
Apart from being a legitimate
bullion dealer, Mr Goldfinger poses...
No, that's not quite fair.
Is, among his many other interests,
a legitimate international jeweller.
He's legally entitled to operate
modest metallurgical installations.
His British one is down in Kent.
We've failed to discover
how he transfers his gold overseas.
And Lord knows we've tried.
If your department can establish
that it is done illegally,
the bank can take action
to recover most of his holdings.
I think it's time Mr Goldfinger and I met.
Socially, of course.
I was hoping you'd say that.
It might lead to a business talk...
Mr Goldfinger's kind of business.
- I'll need some sort of bait.
- I quite agree.
This is the only one we have
from the Nazi hoard in Lake Toplitz.
But there are undoubtedly others.
Mr Bond can make
whatever use of it he thinks fit.
Providing he returns it, of course.
It's worth ?,000.
You'll draw it from Q branch
with your equipment in the morning.
Of course, sir.
- Morning, Q.
- Morning, 007.
This way, please.
My, we are busy this morning!
It's not perfected yet.
- Where's my Bentley?
- It's had its day, I'm afraid.
- But it's never let me down.
- M's orders, 007.
You'll be using this Aston Martin DB5
with modifications.
Now, pay attention, please.
Windscreen-bulletproof.
As are the side and the rear windows.
Revolving number plates, naturally.
Valid all countries.
Here's a nice little transmitting device,
called a homer.
You prime it by pressing that back
like this. You see?
The smaller model is now
standard field issue,
to be fitted into the heel of your shoe.
Its larger brother is magnetic.
Right. It'll be concealed in the car
you're trailing while you keep out of sight.
Reception
on the dashboard here.
Audiovisual, range 1 50 miles.
Ingenious, and useful too.
Allow a man to stop off
for a quick one en route.
It has not been perfected
out of years of patient research
entirely for that purpose, 007.
And incidentally we'd appreciate its
return, along with your other equipment.
Intact, for once,
when you return from the field.
You'd be surprised at the wear and tear
that goes on out there in the field.
- Anything else?
- I won't keep you for more than an hour
if you give me
your undivided attention.
We've installed
some interesting modifications.
You see this arm here?
Now, open the top and inside are
your defence mechanism controls.
Smoke screen. Oil slick.
Rear bulletproof screen.
And left and right
front-wing machine guns.
Now, this one I'm particularly keen about.
You see the gear lever here?
Now, if you take the top off,
you'll find a little red button.
- Whatever you do, don't touch it.
- And why not?
Because you'll release
this section of the roof
and engage and fire
the passenger ejector seat.
Ejector seat? You're joking!
I never joke about my work, 007.
- Ready, Blacking?
- Yes, sir.
An old member has dropped by, sir.
Same handicap as yours.
- I wondered if you'd rather play with him.
- Where is he?
- Mr Bond.
- Yes?
This is Mr Goldfinger.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- You can leave now. The first tee is clear.
- Fine.
- Hawker will caddy for you, Mr Bond.
- That'll be splendid.
Shall we make it a shilling a hole?
- I'll take some tees.
- Yes, of course.
You must excuse Oddjob, Mr Bond.
He's an admirable manservant
but mute. He's not a very good caddy.
Golf is not yet
the national game of Korea.
This meeting is not a coincidence.
What's your game, Mr Bond?
- My game?
- You didn't come here to play golf.
A 1 940 smelt from
the Weigenhaler foundry at Essen.
- Part of a smelt of 600.
- They vanished in 1 944.
When the Nazis were on the run.
- Do you have access to more?
- Yes, from the same source.
Interesting.
- Two holes to go.
- Yes, and all square.
Then you have no objection
to increasing the stakes?
- No. What do you have in mind?
- The bar of gold you have, naturally.
- It's worth ?,000
]- Oh, I'll stake the cash equivalent!
Naturally.
Strict rules of golf?
But of course.
Bad luck, you're in the rough.
What a pity. Here it is.
No, it's not. He plays a Slazenger 1 .
Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger.
Five minutes are almost up.
A lost ball will cost you
stroke and distance.
I'm still training him as a caddy.
Successfully, too.
Slazenger No.1 .
Good.
If that's his original ball,
I'm Arnold Palmer.
It isn't.
- How do you know?
- I'm standing on it.
Why, you crafty old... !
Leave it.
- The ball you found, sir?
- Yes, Slazenger 7.
Let's have a little fun with Mr Goldfinger.
Like me to mark it or knock it in?
Play it.
- This for a half.
- That's right.
One to go, that will be the clincher.
Fine.
Did you switch 'em, sir?
- Then we've got him.
- If he doesn't notice the switch.
- It's your honour, sir.
- It's all right.
Down in five.
I have to sink this to halve the game,
right?
- You win, Goldfinger.
- It seems I'm too good for you!
You play a Slazenger 1, don't you?
- Yes, why?
- This is a Slazenger 7.
Here's my Penfold Hearts.
You must have played the wrong ball
on the 18th fairway.
We are playing strict rules, so
I'm afraid you lose
the hole and the match.
She's a beauty. Phantom IIl, '37, isn't she?
- You are clever and resourceful, Mr Bond.
- Thank you.
Perhaps too clever. Twice our paths
have crossed. Let's leave it at that.
Didn't our first meeting convince you?
I see. You're worried about me
not giving you a return game.
Both of us know perfectly well
what we're talking about, Mr Bond.
But I see that it is necessary
to remind you.
Oddjob!
Many people have tried to involve
themselves in my affairs.
Unsuccessfully.
Remarkable. But what does
the club secretary have to say?
Nothing, Mr Bond.
I own the club.
I assume you want the cheque
made out to cash.
That would be perfectly satisfactory.
Goodbye, Mr Bond.
I believe this is yours.
Can I have your attention, please?
British United Air Ferries
announce the final call
for the departure
of their VF400 flight to Geneva.
British United Air Ferries announce the
departure of their VF400 flight to Geneva.
Mr Bond!
I've got you booked on the next flight
to Geneva, leaving in half an hour.
- Thank you very much.
- Right, sir.
Discipline, 007.
Discipline.
Are you all right? Here, let me help you.
- You know, you're lucky to be alive.
- No thanks to you.
You should've pulled over further.
Look at them!
A double blowout.
I've never seen one of these before.
- How could new tyres... ?
- A defect of some kind, most likely.
I'm so glad it's the car and not you.
You don't look like a girl
who should be ditched.
Never mind that.
Please take me to a garage.
Certainly.
By the way, my name is Bond, Ja...
As quickly as possible.
- I'll take that.
- Yes, of course.
What's your name, by the way?
Soames. Tilly Soames.
Here for the hunting season?
I had a case just like that one.
It's for my ice skates.
Lovely sport.
- Where do you skate?
- St Moritz.
I didn't know there was ice there
this time of the year.
There's a garage.
Frulein!
I've had an accident.
How long will it take?
Thank you.
They say it'll take 24 hours to get
new tyres. There's a hotel nearby.
- Jump in. I'll run you down.
- That won't be necessary.
I hate to leave you here alone.
I can take care of myself.
Yes, I'm sure you can.
Well... don't forget to write.
Smuggling is an art, Mr Ling.
And art requires...
In this case, the bodywork
of my Rolls Royce is 18-carat gold.
We dismantle it here.
Reduce the gold in this special furnace,
which in turn...
...weighing approximately two tons.
I make six trips a year to Europe
in the Rolls Royce, Mr Ling.
It would be wiser to suspend
your other activities.
Mr Ling, please assure your principals
Operation Grand Slam
will have my undivided attention...
Let me go! You're breaking my back!
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I want to kill him!
- Kill who?
- Goldfinger.
- Well, I want him alive.
- I want him dead! He killed my sister!
TM. Tilly Masterson.
I knew your sister Jill.
I know what he did to her.
No, you don't! Let me go!
- So why did you shoot at me?
- I didn't. I was shooting at him!
Well, you're a lousy shot.
But somebody else around here isn't.
Come on.
Get in the car. I'll take care of him.
Run for that bracken when I tell you.
Now!
Good evening, 007.
My name is James Bond.
And members of your curious profession
are few in number.
You have been recognised.
Let's say by one of your opposite
numbers, who is also licensed to kill.
That interesting car of yours!
l, too, have a new toy, but
considerably more practical.
You are looking at an industrial laser,
which emits an extraordinary light,
unknown in nature.
It can project a spot on the moon.
Or at closer range, cut through
solid metal. I will show you.
This is gold, Mr Bond.
All my life,
I've been in love with its colour,
its brilliance, its divine heaviness.
I welcome any enterprise
that will increase my stock,
which is considerable.
I think you've made your point.
Thank you for the demonstration.
Choose your next witticism carefully,
Mr Bond. It may be your last.
The purpose of our two encounters
is now very clear to me.
I do not intend to be distracted
by another. Good night, Mr Bond.
Do you expect me to talk?
No, Mr Bond! I expect you to die!
There is nothing you can talk to me about
that I don't already know.
You're forgetting one thing.
If I fail to report, 008 replaces me.
I trust he will be more successful.
He knows what I know.
You know nothing, Mr Bond.
Operation Grand Slam, for instance.
Two words you may have overheard
which cannot have any significance
to you or anyone in your organisation.
Can you afford to take that chance?
You are quite right, Mr Bond.
You are worth more to me alive.
Who are you?
My name is Pussy Galore.
I must be dreaming.
I thought I'd wake up dead.
Tranquilliser gun. Knockout shot.
I see.
I'm delighted to be here.
And, by the way, where is here?
over Newfoundland.
That explains the humming.
That means you're in Mr Goldfinger's
Lockheed JetStar, heading for Baltimore.
- And you're his guest.
- I'm honoured.
I never realised he enjoyed
my company that much.
I don't suppose it'll be all fun and games.
Mei-Lei.
Can I do something for you, Mr Bond?
Just a drink.
A martini, shaken not stirred.
- Won't you join me?
- Not on duty.
I'm Mr Goldfinger's personal pilot.
You are?
And just how personal is that?
I'm a damn good pilot.
Period!
Well, that's good news. By the way,
- Where is our host?
- He flew on ahead.
Thank you.
Here's to Operation Grand Slam.
This should be a memorable flight.
You can turn off the charm.
I'm immune.
We'll be landing in Baltimore,
our port of entry into the United States,
in 55 minutes.
Mei-Lei.
I would like to arrive
more appropriately dressed.
Did any of my luggage survive with me?
And my attach?case?
Black attach?case damage
]when examined. So sorry.
Apologies quite unnecessary.
Sydney, tell Mei-Lei
to keep an eye on him.
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.
Do you want to play it easy...
or the hard way?
And this isn't a tranquilliser.
Pussy, you know a lot more
about planes than guns.
That's a Smith & Wesson .45.
If you fire this close, the bullet
will pass through me and the fuselage
like a blowtorch through butter.
The cabin will depressurise and we'll
be sucked into outer space together.
If that's how you want to arrive,
you're welcome.
As for me, I prefer the easier way.
That's very sensible.
And there's so much going on
around Mr Goldfinger,
I wouldn't dream of
not accepting his... hospitality.
He'll be very glad to see you, too.
You like close shaves, don't you?
Washington, sir. On the green scrambler.
- M here.
- Leiter, sir.
It's about 007, sir.
We picked up his homer signal
from Friendship Airport, Baltimore,
where he's just landed.
Baltimore? Nice of him to let us know.
Last we heard, he was in Switzerland.
He came in on a private jet, ex Geneva.
Registered to our old friend
Auric Goldfinger.
I'm glad he's making progress.
Keep an eye on him for us.
Bluegrass Field, Kentucky,
is their final destination.
Don't charge in on him
and spoil anything, will you?
He's evidently well on top at the moment.
- Mr Bond.
- Of course.
Please.
Any time.
Thank you.
Do mind your step, Captain.
Just keep playing it easy.
Mei-Lei, will you see everything's
all right with Mr Goldfinger?
And I'll see you surprisingly soon.
- Talented chaps.
- They should be. I trained them.
Come on.
You're a woman of many parts, Pussy.
I believe the bourbon and branch water
is rather splendid here in Kentucky.
Well, now that we're both off duty,
perhaps...
Manners, Oddjob.
I thought you always
took your hat off to a lady.
- You know, he kills little girls like you.
- Little boys, too.
Well?
- Dress rehearsal went like a dream.
- Good.
Your final briefing is tonight.
That'll be all for now.
Welcome to Auric Stud, Mr Bond.
Lovely animal, isn't she?
Certainly better bred than the owner.
Show Mr Bond to his quarters, please.
Felix!
- Maybe we should just drop in on him.
- He'll shout if he needs us.
They're all here, Mr Goldfinger.
Oh, yes! Thank you, Kisch.
That guy Solo's gonna wear a hole
in his shoes.
Yeah, I like this!
Gentlemen!
Goldfinger, why weren't we told New York
and the West Coast were in on this?
Look who's talking!
I do not do business with Chicago.
I thought we had
a private business deal to settle.
Now I find I'm attending
a hoods' convention.
Goldfinger, I made a delivery.
Where is my money?
- I made a delivery, too.
- You all made the deliveries we agreed.
And you owe me one million bucks.
I owe each of you a million
in gold bullion.
So, pay!
Gentlemen,
you can have the million today.
Or ten millions tomorrow.
Did you say ten million?
As soon as my bank opens
in the morning.
Banks don't open on Sunday.
My bank will.
What's with that trick pool table?
- Cover him!
- Hey, cover those doors.
Turn those lights back on!
What are you trying to pull, Goldfinger?
There is no cause for alarm, gentlemen.
I don't like being cooped up
like this. What's that map doing there?
This is my bank.
The gold depository at Fort Knox,
gentlemen.
In its vaults are $1 5 billion.
The entire gold supply
of the United States.
Knock off Fort Knox!
- Got a key or somethin'?
- Of a kind.
There are 35,000 troops
stationed around there!
And who's gonna say boo to them,
Goldfinger?
- What's going on here?
- What is this?
- The floor!
- What is this? A merry-go-round?
Man has climbed Mount Everest,
gone to the bottom of the ocean.
He has fired rockets to the moon.
Split the atom.
Achieved miracles
in every field of human endeavour...
except crime!
The underworld
will applaud for centuries!
- Cut the commercial!
- Get to the point!
It's pointless.
The depository's impregnable.
- The joint is bombproof, electrified...
- Bear with me, please!
Fort Knox is a bank. Like any other.
Larger, better protected perhaps,
but nonetheless a bank!
It can be... I think the expression is
blown.
My plan is foolproof, gentlemen!
I call it Operation Grand Slam.
I have devoted 1 5 years of my life to it.
Every detail has been
scrupulously prepared.
Every eventuality has been considered.
We'll operate on a split-second schedule.
Your organisation, Mr Midnight,
brought a batch of these canisters
across the Canadian border.
They contain Delta 9.
- Delta 9? What's that?
- An invisible nerve gas
which disperses 1 5 minutes after
inducing complete... unconsciousness
for 24 hours.
Tomorrow at dawn,
the flying circus of my personal pilot,
Miss Pussy Galore,
will spray it into the atmosphere.
Once the population, including
the military, has been immobilised
my task force,
which Mr Strap and his people
smuggled across
the Rio Grande from Mexico,
will approach Fort Knox
in motorised equipment
along Bullion Boulevard,
which runs past the depository here
and intersects with Gold Vault Road.
This fence surrounding the depository,
as Mr Strap reminded us, is electrified.
It will be dynamited!
My task force will then move
to the main entrance and demolish it.
How, may I ask?
You made that possible, Mr Solo. By
using your influence in shipping circles
to bring through customs uninspected
a consignment labelled machine parts.
All that will then remain is to descend
to the vaults where the bullion is stored.
- I've heard enough.
- Let him finish.
If you have no objection...
I'll take my money now.
What's the matter, Solo?
Too big for you to handle?
We must respect Mr Solo's decision.
Excuse me for a moment while I take care
of him. Make yourselves comfortable.
- How do we get it out?
- That's the bit I wanna hear!
Yeah, it'd better be good!
Pussy!
Who taught you judo?
The gun you took.
The gun.
The gun, of course.
We must have a few
fast falls together some time.
Hey, Strap!
He's got the right answers.
You and me don't even have to be there.
The boys can handle everything.
Hey, they closed up the fireplace!
- I don't like this!
- What's going on here?
The gas!
Such a pity you did not choose to remain
with the others, Mr Solo. However...
Mr Bond, I thought
you were resting in your quarters.
They are delightful.
But it's much too nice to stay indoors.
I ran into Miss Galore
and she suggested that we join you.
Mr Solo, Mr Bond.
Another of my distinguished guests.
- Hello.
- Leaving us so soon, Mr Solo?
- He has a pressing engagement.
- Yeah. I'd like to get started, Goldfinger.
- Boy!
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.
My plane will get you
to New York on time
with your excess luggage.
Allow me.
My chauffeur's an excellent driver.
You will be at the airport in a few minutes.
Goodbye, Mr Solo.
Some other time, perhaps?
Happy landings, old boy.
I found him under the model.
Operation Grand Slam.
I did enjoy your briefing.
So did I.
He's on the move.
Slow down, don't crowd him.
Are you blind or something?
You missed the turn!
They've turned to the right
just ahead here somewhere.
Where's this old pal of yours headed?
Ten'll get you one, it's a drink or a dame.
Dead.
- Mechanical failure, maybe?
- Unless he switched it off.
Why would he do that?
- Drive to the farm, it's all we can do.
- Right.
Your share of Operation Grand Slam will
make you a very rich woman, my dear.
Why else would I be in it, Mr Goldfinger?
You'll retire to England, I suppose?
No, I've spotted a little island
in the Bahamas.
I'll hang up a sign, "no trespassing",
and go back to nature.
- Yes, Kisch?
- Two men in a car with binoculars.
Touts looking for racing tips.
There's another possibility, however.
Kisch, ask Mr Bond to join us.
We were right to spare Mr Bond's life
in Switzerland,
if those gentlemen are his friends.
Let's convince them
he needs no assistance.
For their benefit, Pussy,
let's make him as happy as possible.
I suggest you change
into something more suitable.
Certainly.
Business before pleasure.
He wants you.
Mr Bond. Sit down, please.
Mint julep?
- Traditional, but satisfying.
- Yes, thanks.
Sour mash, but not too sweet, please.
You disappoint me, Goldfinger.
You know Operation Grand Slam
simply won't work.
And incidentally
Delta 9 nerve gas is fatal.
You are unusually well informed,
Mr Bond.
You'll kill 60,000 people uselessly.
Ha! American motorists
kill that many every two years.
Yes, well... I've worked out
a few statistics of my own.
$1 5 billion
in gold bullion weighs 10,500 tons.
to load it onto 200 trucks.
At the most, you'll have two hours
before the army, navy, air force, marines
move in and make you put it back.
Who mentioned anything
about removing it?
Is the julep tart enough for you?
You plan to break into
the world's largest bank
but not to steal anything.
Why?
Go on, Mr Bond.
Mr Ling, the Red Chinese agent
at the factory?
He's a specialist in nuclear fission...
But of course!
His government's given you a bomb.
I prefer to call it an atomic device.
It's small but particularly dirty.
- Cobalt and iodine?
- Precisely.
If you explode it in Fort Knox, the...
...entire gold supply of the United States
will be radioactive for...
...57 years.
I apologise, Goldfinger.
It's an inspired deal.
They get what they want -
economic chaos in the West.
And the value of your gold
increases many times.
I conservatively estimate... ten times.
Brilliant.
But the atomic device, as you call it,
is already, obviously, in this country.
Obviously.
But bringing it to Fort Knox undetected
could be risky. Very risky.
On the contrary, Mr Bond.
The risk is all on your side.
If the authorities
should attempt to locate it,
who knows where
it might be exploded?
Perhaps the Polaris submarine pens
at New London,
Cape Kennedy,
near the White House.
But we are speculating idly.
Operation Grand Slam will be successful.
You will be there to see for yourself.
Too closely for comfort, I'm afraid.
Forgive me, Mr Bond,
but I must arrange
to separate my gold from the late Mr Solo.
As you said,
he had a pressing engagement.
Very chic, Miss Galore.
Don't you agree?
Please entertain Mr Bond for me, Pussy.
I'll join you both later.
How about it, handsome?
Don't you think it's time
we got to know each other socially?
The new Miss Galore.
Where do you hide your gold knuckles
in this outfit?
I never carry weapons
after business hours.
Yeah? So you're off duty?
I'm completely defenceless.
So am I.
That's my James!
Beautiful place Goldfinger has here.
Yes, I'm glad you're enjoying it.
Too bad it all has to end
tomorrow morning.
He's quite mad, you know.
Well, now. What do we have here?
well in hand.
Come on, I'm bushed.
Let's get back to the motel.
- You're quite a girl, Pussy.
- I'm strictly the outdoor type.
I'd like to think
you're not in all of this... caper.
Skip it. I'm not interested. Let's go.
What would it take
for you to see things my way?
A lot more than you've got.
- How do you know?
- I don't want to know.
Isn't it customary to grant
a condemned man his last request?
You've asked for this.
Get up!
Certainly.
There.
Now let's both play.
Pussy Galore to Champagne leader.
Commence Rockabye Baby. Good luck!
Speed: 220.
Wind check: westerly.
Champagne leader to Champagne
section. Commence dive... now.
Ready for Rockabye Baby.
Commence spray on countdown.
Five,
four, three, two,
zero.
Champagne leader
to Grand Slam task force leader.
The baby is asleep.
I repeat, the baby is asleep.
We're going home now.
Out.
Good morning, Mr Bond.
For once,
you are exactly where I want you.
- The bomb's here.
- Let's get moving, Brigadier.
- Right, Jack, move in.
- Move in, commando tactics.
Minimum offensive fire until I signal
bomb has been neutralised.
Minimum offensive fire
until I signal bomb has been neutralised.
Bomb disposal unit to accompany DOG.
Goodbye, Mr Bond.
Mr Ling, it is merely timing...
He's one of them, so is the girl.
I'll get her, you get the door open.
We're trapped!
The bomb... I'll take the fuse out.
Don't be a fool!
You can be a hero, I'm not!
No, no!
Keep going! Hurry up!
What kept you?
You OK, James?
Where's your butler friend?
He blew a fuse.
Three more ticks and Mr Goldfinger
would've hit the jackpot.
- Did you get him?
- Not yet, but he won't get far.
- And Pussy?
- She helped to switch the canisters.
By the way,
what made her call Washington?
I must have appealed
to her maternal instincts.
Come on, James. Get aboard.
You can't keep the President waiting.
Special plane, lunch at the White House.
How come?
The President wants
to thank you personally.
- It was nothing, really.
- I know that, but he doesn't.
I suppose I'll be able to get a drink here.
I told the stewardess liquor for three.
- Who are the other two?
- There are no other two.
- Goodbye, Felix.
- So long. Good luck.
- Thank you, Brigadier.
- Good luck.
I'm glad to have you aboard, Mr Bond.
Well, congratulations
on your promotion, Goldfinger.
- Are you going to the White House, too?
- In two hours I shall be in Cuba.
You have interfered with my plans
for the last time, Mr Bond.
It's very dangerous to fire guns in planes.
I even had to warn Pussy about it.
- By the way, where is she?
- I will deal with her later.
She is where she ought to be...
at the controls.
Pussy!
- What happened? Where's Goldfinger?
- Playing his golden harp.
It's no good.
Oh, no, you don't!
This is no time to be rescued.
The coffin...
it has your initials, J.B.
At this moment,
rather him than me.
At least you've been saved
the effort of removing him.
Colonel Bouvar passed away
in his sleep, so they tell me.
You sound disappointed
you did not kill him yourself.
I am. Jacques Bouvar murdered
two of my colleagues.
Is there anything else our
French station can do for Monsiuer Bond?
Later, perhaps.
As I said, later. Come on.
Madame...
I've come to offer
my sincere condolences.
My dear Colonel Bouvar...
I don't think you should have
opened that car door by yourself.
No well-dressed man
should be without one.
Yes, very practical.
Get inside.
- They're coming to get me.
- Hurry!
He always runs
While others walk
He acts
While other men just talk
He looks at this world
And wants it all
So he strikes
Like Thunderball
He knows the meaning
Of success
His needs are more
So he gives less
They call him
The winner who takes all
And he strikes
Like Thunderball
Any woman he wants
He'll get
He will break any heart
Without regret
His days of asking
Are all gone
His fight goes on
And on and on
But he thinks that the fight
Is worth it all
So he strikes
Like Thunderball
Hey, no parking here!
Pardon, Monsieur Largo.
The International Brotherhood for
the Assistance of Stateless Persons...
is purely philanthropic.
We're not interested in politics...
only in your rehabilitation.
We have been able to arrange for
visas at the Brazilian Consulate.
The Brotherhood
will look after you until...
- Good morning, Mr. Largo.
- Good morning.
- Nice to have you back again.
- Thank you, my dear.
- We pay back everything!
- There will be no need.
We have certain funds from
private individuals who share our aim.
Sit down, Number Two.
We will discuss...
your NATO project later.
I regret to inform you all
of the death of Spectre Number Six.
Colonel Jacques Bouvar was killed
by an unknown assassin.
His services will be greatly missed.
We will now proceed with the area
financial reports. Number Seven.
Blackmail of the double agent
Matsou Fujiwa.
Unfortunately, only 40 million yen.
- All the man had.
- Number Ten.
Assassination of Perringe,
the French antimatter specialist...
who went over to the Russians.
Three million francs
from the special department...
- of the Quai D'Orsay.
- Number Five.
Our consultation fee for the
British train robbery: 250,000 pounds.
Number 11.
Distribution of Red China narcotics
in the United States...
Number Nine and myself.
Two million three...
Our expectations were considerably
higher, Number 11.
Competition from Latin America.
Prices are down.
I anticipated that factor.
Are you quite sure all monies...
have been accounted for
by yourself and Number Nine?
- To the penny, Number One.
- On the contrary...
I have satisfied myself that
one of you is clearly...
guilty of embezzlement.
Spectre is a dedicated fraternity...
whose strength lies in
the absolute integrity of its members.
The culprit is known to me.
I have decided
on the appropriate action.
Let us now proceed with new business.
We will hear from Number Two,
who's in charge of our NATO project...
the most ambitious Spectre
has ever undertaken.
Your report, Number Two.
Thank you, Number One.
Our intention
is to demand a ransom...
from the
North Atlantic Treaty Powers...
of 280 million dollars...
I have sent Spectre agent Count Lippe
to the south of England...
where he is making
the necessary preparations.
He is at a health clinic...
conveniently located
near the NATO air base.
- Oh, Pat?
- Hello.
- I'll see you when I've had a shower.
- I'll soon be finished.
- Mr. Bond, Count Lippe.
- You're not taking her away already?
She's the only joy
in this dreary place.
I see you've discovered that too.
- About half an hour, Pat.
- I'll be ready.
I've heard that before.
Nice to have met you, Mr. Bond.
Funny looking bruise. A fall?
A poker in the hands of a widow.
I'm surprised. I'd have thought
you were just the type for a widow.
Not this one.
He didn't like me at all.
A red square
with a spike through it.
I think it's a Tong sign,
the red dragon from Macao.
- Ask records to verify it for me.
- Sorry, sweetie. You're off duty.
- File it till you get back.
- Moneypenny...
next time I see you,
I'll put you across my knee.
On yogurt and lemon juice?
I can hardly wait.
Come on, Pat.
I'm coming.
I can't hear you. Have you fainted?
You're late, Mr. Bond.
Me?
I'd never have recognized myself.
- Do I seem healthy?
- Too healthy. Take off your bathrobe.
You never say that
as if you meant it.
Arms above your head, please.
Behave yourself, Mr. Bond!
I can see there's only
one place to keep you quiet.
What's this?
A motorized traction table
for stretching the spine.
Some patients call it the rack.
I'm not surprised.
Get on.
Where's the kick starter?
Stop fooling around
and face down, please.
Face down.
By the way, who is the man
in the room next to your Count Lippe?
I really don't know
too much about him.
A Mr. Angelo.
He's here with a private physician,
recuperating from an awful car crash.
There, now, the first time
I've felt really safe all day.
I'll look in and see
how you're doing in 15 minutes.
Nice to have met you.
Hey, come back!
Help!
Oh, thank God!
You could've been killed!
I must be six inches taller.
You poor dear.
I can't think how
it could have happened.
I can tell you, it's a miracle
I came back when I did.
I can only think that you must have
pushed the switch accidentally.
You better come along with me.
Spend a few minutes in the steam room.
It'll help to relax you.
- Yes.
- Might even shrink you back to size.
Somebody's going to wish
today had never happened.
You wouldn't tell Dr. Wain.
Please, I'd lose my job.
Well, I suppose my silence
could have a price.
You don't mean... Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
See you later, irrigator.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Don't you worry. I'll tell the chef.
Let me out of this bloody machine!
Help!
Mink.
It reduces the tensions.
Not mine.
Major Derval's social secretary.
- I would like to speak to Mr. Angelo.
- What's that?
- Mr. Angelo.
- I'm sorry.
You got the wrong number.
You don't think you could be
more comfortable if you take off this...
- Yes?
- Major Derval?
- This is Major Derval.
- Your car is waiting.
I'll be down right away. Thank you.
My car's here. Duty calls.
The story of my life.
You'll be late at the air base.
Besides, it will give you
time to cool off.
You'll be here when I come back?
But I may not be in the mood then.
- Do you wanna bet?
- You know your Francois.
I know me.
All right.
- I told him I'd be down.
- Your coat, sir.
Happy landing!
Thank you.
Be good, at least until I get back.
- Nobody saw us. The corridor's empty.
- Shut the door!
He's dead all right.
Lippe, you take over.
- Are the doctor and ambulance outside?
- Everything as arranged.
Angelo.
Your breathing equipment.
Isolates you from the oxygen supply.
Gamma gas. Instantaneous.
Type you just used. And most important...
Not enough.
- What are you trying to say?
- I changed my mind.
Two years of my life...
studying the film, the reports...
plastic operations, voice lessons.
Make it a quarter of a million,
or get someone else.
- There is no one else.
- Exactly. I am Derval.
Put that away. Angelo is right.
I'll inform Number One
we made a new arrangement.
This is merely a down payment.
All right, but against
a quarter of a million.
- Agreed.
- His watch.
Identification Disc.
- Au revoir!
- No, he always says ciao.
The cap's too far back on your head.
The rest of my money,
just have it ready.
Come on. Get him into his pajamas.
Sir, identity, please.
Thank you, sir.
This is a normal training sortie,
and you'll be accompanied...
by a NATO representative,
Commandant Derval...
Major Derval of NATO.
It's a routine flight.
You'll be flying a Vulcan...
at an altitude of 45,000 feet...
armed with two atomic bombs,
M.O.S. Type.
Fuses as usual
in the white security box.
Oh, those damned aeroplanes!
They're enough to drive you mad.
Unless, of course,
it's that mink glove of yours.
I'll shut out the noise.
James, where are you going?
Nowhere. I thought
I'd take a little exercise.
You must be joking.
Come on.
Quiet!
Can I help you?
County Police here.
Hello?
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
Could it be the front doorbell?
- It most certainly could not.
- Hello.
Haven't you had enough exercise
for one evening?
It's funny you should say that.
Point of return...
Switch from manual to auto.
It's set on automatic. Commandant...
would you care to change places
with the copilot?
- Better view up here.
- I'd be delighted.
This is Southern Radar.
You are now under
positive radar control.
This is avoiding action.
Request you report your position.
Take this, will you?
What's the flap, Dawson?
O-B-N-R, sir. NATO training flight.
Air traffic flashed us.
They lost it on radar. We haven't
been able to pick it up anywhere.
Was she losing altitude
when she went off the screen?
Rapidly.
We can't scan below 300 feet.
- She may have gone down.
- Was she in trouble?
Not according to the last report,
which came from about here.
- She is armed, isn't she?
- Two atomic weapons, M.O.S. Type.
Get everything you can into the area.
A thorough search.
Notify the Admiralty at once.
Top priority. Absolute security.
- Ask them to contact Washington.
- Very good, sir.
Is there anything else in sight?
No. All clear.
Switch on
the underwater landing lights.
Open the underwater hatch.
- Stand by to winch in the submarine.
- Man the winches!
- Give these bomb fuses to Mr. Kutze.
- Right, sir.
Get the submarine up quickly and
the bombs loaded in the containers.
Kutze, are you pleased
with your new toys?
Some new safety device.
A secret control.
What can they have that the great
Ladislav Kutze cannot handle?
Life was much simpler
in my Warsaw laboratory.
Your share will amount to
how many Nobel Prizes?
Pull forward!
More. Hold it!
Paris, sir.
Number One on the scrambler.
Number Two speaking.
Phase two completed.
Number Two has done well,
unlike Count Lippe...
whose choice of Angelo might have
jeopardized the success of our project.
Send a message to the Execution Branch.
You will write,
or telephone at the least.
Day by day. I'm truly sorry
I have to dash off like this.
There's been a bit
of a flap at the office.
- What kind of work do you do?
- I travel...
sort of a licensed troubleshooter.
Mr. Angelo. Heart attack last night.
I'm not surprised.
- Keep in touch.
- Anytime, James. Anyplace.
Another time, another place.
- You are late!
- Yes.
Some people on the road
really burn you up these days.
In the conference room.
Something pretty big.
Every Double-0 man in Europe has been
rushed in, and the Home Secretary too.
His wife's probably lost her dog.
Well, now that we're all here...
The Prime Minister
has asked the Home Secretary...
to come and represent him here today.
The Home Secretary.
Gentlemen, the tape
that you are about to hear...
was received at 10 Downing Street
this morning.
My dear Prime Minister.
Two atomic bombs...
numbers 4-5-6 and 4-5-7...
which were aboard NATO flight 7-5-9...
are now in the possession of Spectre.
Unless within the next seven days
your government...
pays to us
in a manner to be designated by us...
we shall destroy
a major city in England...
or the United States of America.
Please signal your acceptance
of our terms by arranging...
for Big Ben to strike seven times...
at 6:00 p. m. Tomorrow.
The Prime Minister and the President...
have talked together
over the hot line and have agreed...
that unless the bombs are recovered,
payment will have to be made.
To avoid general panic...
complete secrecy will be maintained
and no press announcements.
The Prime Minister has asked
that your department...
take charge of the operation.
Thank you. Sir John.
This circle represents
the full flying range of the Vulcan.
Extensive search has failed to locate
any evidence of either a crash...
or landing, and worldwide reports
have proved negative...
on all airfields large enough
to handle the Vulcan.
- That's all we have, sir.
- Thank you, Sir John.
I'll leave you to carry on.
We'll keep you in touch from Number 10.
Thank you, sir.
You may now open the folders
in front of you.
Code name: Thunderball.
As you can see,
we've very little to go on.
All the members of the crew...
had top security clearance.
You'll find their photographs
and service records in your files.
You'll be working with NATO, C.I. A...
and all allied intelligence units.
That's all...
until you discuss your
individual assignments with me.
I've assigned you
to station C, Canada.
Group Captain Pritchard here
will be your Air Force liaison.
Sir, I respectfully suggest that
you change my assignment to Nassau.
Is there any other reason besides
your enthusiasm of water sports?
Perhaps this, sir.
- Well?
- There was a photograph of that man...
in this dossier you gave us.
His name is Derval.
I saw him last night at Shrublands,
but he was dead.
Oh, no, sir. Not possible.
He was seen...
boarding the Vulcan
and took off last night.
If 007 says he saw Derval
last night and he was dead...
that's enough for me
to initiate inquiries.
Yes, of course.
- Who is this girl?
- Derval's sister.
- Do you know where she is now?
- Nassau.
Do you think she's worth going after?
I wouldn't put it quite that way.
We've only got four days.
Don't spend your time sitting around.
No, sir, I won't.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Smashing figure.
I don't suppose...
that has anything to do
with your request?
Was there ever a man
more misunderstood?
You can't pull the wool over my eyes.
You may be able to con the old man,
but I know better. I could...
So do I, Miss Moneypenny.
And I'll thank you not to refer to me
as the old man.
I think I had a hat when I came in.
How else will you recognize her?
Couldn't miss.
She has two moles on the left thigh.
- Thank you, Mr...
- James Bond.
I arrived soon after you went down.
- I've been admiring your form.
- Have you?
Your name's James Bond
and you've been admiring my form.
Most girls just paddle around.
- You swim like a man.
- So do you.
I've had quite a bit of practice.
- Do you come here often?
- Whenever I'm bored.
Practically every day.
What else do you do, and where?
- You don't waste time, do you?
- No.
- For effort.
- Thank you.
I'll wear it so you know me next time.
I was right. Couldn't miss.
- I'm not with you.
- You soon will be.
Paula!
- Give me a hand, will you?
- Get in.
Tell London I've made contact
with the girl.
Well, it's not what I'd call contact.
I'll pass it through
you've seen the girl.
- Keep trying.
- It won't start!
Ahoy there! Our motor's conked out.
You wouldn't be going anywhere
near Coral Harbor, would you?
I wasn't, but I could.
I have a very important appointment.
I'd appreciate a lift.
Come aboard then!
You don't mind taking
the service boat, do you?
Not at all.
Hurry up!
- Perhaps lunch by the pool.
- How about your urgent appointment?
How long have you been out here?
About three weeks.
Don't you ever stop asking questions?
All right. Change of tack.
Have some of my conch chowder.
You've been reading
the wrong books, Mr. Bond.
- About conch chowder?
- Being an aphrodisiac.
It just so happens that
I like conch chowder.
Friend of yours?
- Works for my guardian.
- Your guardian has you watched?
- He likes to know where I am.
- I don't blame him.
- Will you excuse me?
- You're not going so soon?
I'm afraid so.
My guardian's yacht.
Oh, really?
- He'll be expecting me.
- May I come with you?
- I'd love to meet your guardian.
- Oh, no.
- Will I see you again?
- It's a small island.
- Perhaps we can have dinner together.
- No.
- My dear, uncooperative Domino.
- How do you know that?
How do you know
my friends call me Domino?
It's on the bracelet on your ankle.
What sharp little eyes you've got.
Wait till you get to my teeth.
Bye then.
See you tomorrow on the beach.
- 500 pounds, please.
- Certainly, monsieur.
Thanks.
Sorry.
- There.
- Thank you.
Two hundred.
Eight.
Someone has to lose.
Yes, I thought I saw
a spectre at your shoulder.
What do you mean?
The spectre of defeat.
Your luck was due to change.
We'll soon find out.
Any objection to raise the limit?
- Too big for me.
- Count me out too.
Perhaps you would like
to take the shoe.
My friend won't mind, Mr...
- Bond.
- Oh, yes. Mr. Bond.
- One of my associates spoke about you.
- Nothing bad, I hope.
It's your spectre against mine.
You wish to put the evil eye on me?
We have a way to deal with that
where I come from.
You may hex me.
Let's see what it does for the cards.
- No.
- Seven.
Six.
Eight.
Nine.
You seem to be unbeatable, Mr. Bond.
For the moment.
This sort of thing can't last.
Emilio, you promised
to buy me a drink.
Soon, my dear.
I want to get my money back first.
May I be allowed
to buy the lady a drink?
- I would appreciate that.
- Then I must pass the shoe.
He's going to be impossible
if his luck doesn't change.
Somehow, I don't think it will tonight.
Beluga caviar, Dom Perignon, '55.
- Monsieur.
- Thank you.
I understand you're Mr. Largo's niece.
Sounds better than... What would you say?
Mistress? Kept woman?
I wouldn't say that.
Where did you meet him?
In Capri. I was there
with my brother, Francois.
Strange. I found Emilio attractive...
then.
- Does he live aboard the yacht?
- No. He has a house on the island.
Must we talk about him?
I'd much rather dance.
So would I.
- Where is your brother now?
- In England.
He's a Commandant
with the NATO forces there.
He's a wonderful person.
The trouble is
I never meet anyone like him.
- Only men like Largo and myself.
- You are not like Largo.
No?
Why do you say that?
The way you hold me.
There.
- How long are you staying in Nassau?
- We're going the day after tomorrow.
As I said,
we haven't got much time.
Emilio wants to leave.
Are you sleeping aboard tonight?
I hoped you'd not be so obvious.
Well, when one has so little time,
one sort of has to be obvious.
- You know where you can find me.
- Mr. Bond.
Your niece is an excellent dancer.
Let me prove I'm as good a loser
as you are a winner.
Come to lunch on Sunday.
The Palmyra. It's my house.
Sunday at noon, then.
My dear.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You must tell me what Mr. Bond
had to say, word for word.
He talked about you a little.
What was he saying just then?
I didn't quite hear.
He asked were we
sleeping aboard tonight.
Interesting.
- My key. It's 304, please.
- Thank you. 304.
- I'm sorry, no mail.
- Thank you.
Well, hello, 00...
That's a fine way
to treat the C.I.A.
Sorry about that, Felix,
but you were about to say 007.
Here.
Have you killed him?
You know me better than that.
Here you go, Smiler.
Have you seen everything
you came to see?
Go back to your friends and report.
Tell them, the little fish I throw back
into the sea. Give it to him.
You're going to shoot me in the back.
The gun, I mean.
Get out!
- Who was he?
- Like I said, a small fish...
working for a Mr. Largo.
He's got a yacht
we should take a look at later.
- Quist to see Mr. Largo.
- Open up.
Yes? It's Quist.
Gently, my friend.
- What did you find?
- Nothing.
- You saw Bond?
- Yes, I saw him.
What happened?
You let him get the better of you.
Hey, there,
did you finally make contact?
You're late. Felix Leiter,
this is Pinder, our man here.
- How do you do?
- This way, gentlemen.
- Who's the girl?
- Paula Kaplan, my assistant here.
He has no plans
to visit the United States.
Now here's a special announcement...
from the Overseas Service
of the B.B.C.
Big Ben actually did strike
seven times at 6:00 this evening.
This was caused
by a mechanical failure...
which last occurred during
a violent electrical storm in 1898.
And here once again
are the headlines.
Obviously stalling for time.
- Oh, no!
- Ah, 007.
- What a wonderful surprise.
- For me too.
I must say, I find this business
of equipping you in the field...
on the run, as it were...
highly irregular.
Here we have a Geiger counter.
Useful and unobtrusive.
The sweep hand
takes the radioactivity count.
- It's waterproof, of course.
- But of course.
Now, here's something I want you
to use with special care.
- With special care.
- Everything you give me...
Is treated with equal contempt.
Yes, I know.
But that's an underwater camera.
It takes eight pictures...
in rapid succession
by pressing that button there.
- Is that clever?
- If you can take pictures...
in the dark with an infrared film, yes.
Try to be a little less than
your usual frivolous self, 007.
Here's a miniature Very pistol...
which fires a bright red flare,
a distress signal.
You should keep it on you
day and night.
I resent that remark.
Look, do you mind?
Now, in the event of a re-breather
not being available...
you can use this device
for short periods only, of course.
Say, about four minutes.
- Clever.
- You'll only use it as a last resort.
It closes
to a convenient pocket size.
Assuming one has a convenient pocket.
Now pay attention.
A recently developed...
harmless radioactive device.
Harmless.
It sends out a homing signal
to a special receiver.
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Obviously, you...
swallow it.
Now?
Let's hope she'll still be lying
in the same place tonight.
We'll use this catamaran
as a rendezvous place for later.
Good idea.
Take her in.
A container will be dropped
off the coast of Burma...
in the Megui Archipelago...
latitude 20 degrees north,
longitude 60 degrees east...
at 20 hundred hours
Greenwich mean time on May 27.
It will hold blue-white
flawless diamonds between...
three and eight carats.
Total value to be not less than
present market price.
After we have
recovered the container...
and verified its contents...
you will be notified on
radio frequency 16.23 megacycles...
where the atomic bombs
may be recovered.
Kenniston, you'd better get on
to De Beers at once.
Yes, sir.
Well, gentlemen,
unless those bombs are found...
I'm very much afraid
we'll have to pay their price.
- Sir?
- Oh, yes.
Signal from 007 in Nassau.
One or two things
that might interest us.
The Disco Volante is still in the
harbor, lying off the casino channel.
The catamaran is there too,
so we can use it for cover.
That's fine. You can drop me
in the water behind her.
- Any further news from London?
- No.
Zero hour is still
- That's just 55 hours from now.
- Yes. Shall we go?
- Okay, this will do here.
- We'll meet back at Pinder's.
Good luck.
Turn the underwater lights on.
TV, closed-circuit!
Hand grenades.
Ready.
Down there.
There!
Hey, there's something there!
Look! Must have hit him
with the propeller.
Let's get back and tell Largo.
- Can I have a lift?
- Sure.
Thank you.
You just about saved my life.
My outboard capsized,
so I had to swim ashore.
How far do you go?
You better fasten your safety belt.
What's your name?
James Bond.
Fiona Volpe.
- Do you fly here often?
- Do I make you nervous?
No, it's just that
I have no desire...
to be capsized twice in one night.
At least you won't
have to swim ashore.
Have you been here before, Mr. Bond?
No, I haven't.
But this is the road to Nassau?
Yes, eventually.
- Well, this is as far as I go.
- Me too. This is my hotel.
- What a coincidence.
- Yes, so convenient.
You look pale.
I hope I didn't frighten you.
You see, I've always
been a nervous passenger.
Some men just don't like to be driven.
No, some men just don't like
to be taken for a ride.
Look at this.
An underwater hatch.
Yeah. So that's how
they could leave and get back.
Yes, and nobody saw them.
Obviously the whole operation...
was carried out underwater.
That's where we'll have to look
for the plane. Come on.
I'll bring the prints
to the hotel when they're dry.
Don't forget the Air Force searched
the area 250 miles out of Nassau.
It must be beyond that radius.
That's if the Disco Volante
was out that night.
Sure she was, but harbor control
said for only six hours.
She couldn't cover 500 miles
in that time, no.
About 90 miles is her limit for
six hours, and that's out and back.
I reckon we've got to go further out.
We'll need more gas for that.
All right.
Let's get back to Nassau.
- We haven't got much time.
- You're right, we haven't.
Pull!
Of course they are watching us.
What else have they to do?
- You would like Bond dead?
- I can think of no better arrangement.
Because he tries to make love
to your woman?
Because he is Bond, and as an enemy
of Spectre, he should be killed.
Mark!
If Bond had died last night
as a result of your hastiness...
his government would have known
for certain that the bombs are here.
When the time is right,
he will be killed. Pull!
I shall kill him.
A separate pool.
For sharks, no less. Move in.
Hold on that line.
That's Largo's place, all right.
My next port of call.
- Mr. Largo?
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- Can I help?
- Why, Mr. Bond.
- Of course you can.
- That looks particularly inviting.
- Welcome to Palmyra.
- It's a pleasure.
I just hope I'm not
interrupting anything.
- What do you mean?
- I thought you had another visitor.
That gun, it looks
more fitting for a woman.
You know much about guns?
No. I know a little about women.
Mr. Jenni, Mr. Vargas.
Mr. Vargas, Mr. Jenni.
- Which is which?
- I thought you might have met...
Mr. Vargas the other night.
- Yes, I believe I did.
- Drink, sir?
- Rum Collins?
- Yes.
Just about that hour, isn't it?
For you? Of course!
Vargas does not drink,
does not smoke...
does not make love.
What do you do, Vargas?
Every man has his passion.
Mine is fishing.
What is yours, Mr. Bond?
Well, I'm not what you'd call
a passionate man.
I think it's time I went to change.
You must let me show you around.
- I'd love that.
- I thought you might.
Pull!
- What could be easier?
- Perhaps you would call one for me?
- Of course. Pull!
- It seems terribly difficult.
No, it isn't, is it?
I collect big game fish
for various marine institutions.
Magnificent creatures!
Charming.
The notorious Golden Grotto sharks.
The most savage, the most dangerous.
They know when it's time
for them to be fed.
- That boat, is she yours?
- Yes. I'm very proud of her.
What does she do, about 15 knots?
Better than that. Near 20.
- Perhaps you'd like to see over her?
- Yes, I would very much.
- Lunch is ready.
- Thank you, my darling.
Come along, Mr. Bond.
The conch chowder smells delicious.
Domino, I was just thinking.
As I'll be busy this evening,
perhaps Mr. Bond will be kind enough...
to take you to the Jankanoo,
our local Mardi Gras.
You'll be my guest tonight.
- That's very kind of you.
- It will be my pleasure.
Our Mr. Bond must have
a very high opinion of himself.
Opinion?
Yes. He has a date with me too.
Excuse me.
- Let me go!
- Over here.
Don't let her make so much noise.
Use the chloroform.
Largo did promise
he'd come, didn't he?
He'll be here. Don't worry.
I think that man is waving at you.
Come down here.
Quick!
Excuse me for a second.
- James, Paula's gone!
- What do you mean, gone?
She just checked out of the hotel.
You look after Domino. Watch her.
- Do you think she was onto something?
- I don't know, but I gotta find out.
- You watch out for her.
- Right.
All right. Thank you.
The governor's not very happy,
but you'll have...
a power cut as requested
all over the island.
I don't give a damn
about the rest of the island.
- I want the lights out in Palmyra.
- You'll have it.
What do you mean, she won't talk?
Don't worry, she will.
What's wrong?
- Is it a power failure?
- Yes, all over the island.
Switch over
to the emergency generator.
Largo told you to be careful.
I didn't kill her.
She must have taken some poison.
A capsule in the mouth.
What do you think, cyanide?
She's dead.
Ricardo, someone's got him!
Search that way!
And you, the shark pool!
- What happened?
- I don't know.
Leave him! This way!
Stop it!
You fools! He's got
you all shooting at each other!
Over here!
No! I've got a better idea.
Lift the tunnel hatch
and let them eat.
Yes, sir.
Sorry, old chap.
Better luck next time.
Tell Leiter to stay with the girl.
I'll get back to him as soon as I can.
- Anything else?
- Tell him Paula's dead.
Aren't you in the wrong room?
Not from where I'm standing.
Since you're here, would you mind
giving me something to put on?
Anyway, I'm very glad to see you again.
I'm glad to see you again.
I had the feeling
you've been avoiding me.
I had no idea that
we were next-door neighbors.
They just moved me down
this afternoon.
It's extraordinary, isn't it?
Almost as if...
As if it was intended.
Yes, it is extraordinary.
Shouldn't you get out
of those wet clothes?
You'll catch your death of cold.
Look, you know
we're going to be too late.
- Too late for what?
- The Jankanoo.
I promised my friends
I'd meet them there.
Perhaps you know them, the Largos.
Questions. All I get is questions.
But the music is gonna
go on all night anyhow.
Enough to drive you wild.
Do you like wild things?
Wild. You should be
locked up in a cage.
This bed feels like a cage.
All these bars.
Do you think I'll be safe?
You made a shocking mess out of
my hair, you sadistic brute.
Will you zip me up, please?
No wonder you can
get dressed so quickly.
On the way, we can have a little talk.
You may find it interesting. Come on.
I'm coming.
I hate to think
I'm gonna miss anything.
And now we can go somewhere
for an interesting talk.
Friends of yours, no doubt. Come in.
You dress quickly too.
I didn't see that gun in the mirror.
Not that it matters, but that
was under the pillow all the time.
When did you find out?
You're wearing the same ring
as Largo.
- It's a ring I like to wear.
- Then it has its dangers.
Vanity, Mr. Bond.
- It's something you know so much about.
- My dear girl.
Don't flatter yourself. What I did
this evening was for King and Country.
You don't think it gave me
any pleasure, do you?
But of course.
I forgot your ego.
James Bond, who only has
to make love to a woman...
and she starts to hear
heavenly choirs singing.
She repents and immediately returns
to the side of right and virtue.
But not this one.
What a blow it must have been,
you having a failure.
Well, you can't win them all.
We'll take him out the front way.
Go and get the car.
Careful, Mr. Bond.
Now what?
Get through to Palmyra and tell them
we've been held up by the Jankanoo.
- Like to have a drink, man?
- Get him away!
- Don't you try anything now.
- Get out of here!
- It's real firewater.
- Get out of here!
After him! Get him!
You haven't seen anything?
Look!
Follow him. You that side, you there.
Stay with us.
- Thank you, I'd love to.
- Love to what?
- You're mad. Do you know that?
- Yes. Isn't everyone?
May I cut in?
You should have told me
your wife was here.
Do you come here often?
It's no good trying to escape.
I don't want to escape.
Strange as it may seem,
I've grown accustomed to your face.
Why don't you come with us quietly?
You don't seem to understand.
You see, I enjoy my dancing.
Do you mind if my friend
sits this one out? She's just dead.
You'll leave here at 0600 hours
and land at Aden to refuel.
You will then proceed
to the Megui Archipelago...
to make your drop precisely at...
20 degrees north,
The diamonds will be
in a special container.
I hate to give in like this.
Paying the blood money,
letting them beat us.
- Have you an alternative suggestion?
- I'm afraid I haven't.
Your man, 007,
I thought he was on to something.
- I thought so too, sir.
- False alarm?
- I'm afraid so.
- He obviously has...
a highly developed sense of,
shall we say, drama?
If 007 thought
he was on to something...
It's a great pity he didn't make sure
before he started to shout the odds.
Well, we have exactly
Then I suppose we shall have to pay up
and look as happy as we can. Shan't we?
Well, that's it, James.
We've looked about everywhere.
We've got to find that plane.
You won't find it down there.
That's the Golden Grotto.
- Golden Grotto?
- Yeah. All you'll find...
down there are sharks.
Take her down. I want a closer look.
- At what?
- Never mind! Take her down, quick!
Set her down.
I think we've found it.
There's something camouflaged
down there. I'll take a look.
Shoot one of those sharks.
It'll keep the others occupied.
I don't know how long the others
will take before they finish him off...
- but they'll be back.
- I'll keep an eye on them.
Good.
- She's down there, all right.
- Are the bombs on board?
- No.
- Great. What's our next move?
We'll check on the Disco Volante.
If the bombs aren't aboard her now,
they soon will be.
Who are you going to ask, Largo?
No, I don't think we'll have to.
I hope we didn't frighten the fish.
Ow! Sea egg spines.
They're poisonous!
Here, give me your arm.
Sit down.
Now turn over.
This is going to hurt a bit.
It's the first time I've
tasted women. They're rather good.
You're the only man
to ever make me cry.
Except perhaps Francois,
my brother, when we were children.
Domino, I have to tell you something.
I'm sorry, James. I didn't mean
to embarrass you, speaking of love.
- I must hurt you again.
- You're going away?
So sorry, my dear, but it's all over.
No, it's about your brother.
What about him?
He's dead.
What happened?
It's a long story,
and it involves your friend Largo.
I need your help.
Of course.
That's why you made love to me.
Look, I can't explain
what this is all about.
- But you must trust me.
- Because you want me to help you?
Largo had your brother murdered,
or it was on his orders.
Hundreds of thousands of people
will die very soon...
if you don't help me.
That much we do know,
but there's something we don't...
The bombs, when they're being loaded
aboard the Disco Volante.
- How could I know that?
- That you'll have to find out.
It won't be easy.
It could be very dangerous.
What can he do to me
he hasn't already done?
Then you'll do it?
- Yes.
- Good.
This is a Geiger counter.
You press this lever.
If it starts clicking,
it means the bombs are aboard.
- What do I do then?
- Go straight up on deck.
As the Disco Volante is being watched,
you'll be spotted.
Vargas, behind you.
Really?
He must have followed us.
I think he got the point.
It should have been Largo.
Largo? When did he expect you back?
Very soon now. He said not to be late.
He was most insistent.
You better go straight back. I'll take
care of Vargas and everything here.
Understand I'm doing this for
my brother, for what he did to him.
But promise you will kill Largo
for me, whatever happens.
- We haven't much time.
- All right.
Oh, something I remembered.
It may not be important.
- Tell me. Everything's important.
- There's a small bridge over the canal.
Largo never allows strangers
to go near it.
By the canal there's a flight of steps.
- Where do they lead to?
- Down into the sea...
on the far side of Palmyra.
Perhaps it is important after all.
Put on your equipment.
Did we get a message saying the girl
went on board the Disco?
Yes, sir. Signal received at...
- If she is on board, where is 007 now?
- That's the question.
Stand by. Five seconds.
Watch my signal.
- Prepare to get underway.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Captain, weigh anchor.
Get underway immediately.
Once we pick up the merchandise,
head for our target area, Miami.
The Disco Volante's leaving, sir.
- I told you to stay in your cabin.
- It's stuffy in there.
- I want a breath of air.
- My dear, did you not hear me?
- Where did you get that?
- I bought it this morning.
- Let me see.
- No. Why should I?
Mr. Bond gave you this little toy,
I imagine, and Vargas is dead.
No, my dear.
There is no escape for you.
Like your friend,
you've been a little too clever.
And now you are caught!
You have given me
much pleasure, Domino.
But in return, unless you tell me
how much Bond knows...
I'll be forced to cause you great pain.
This for heat, these for cold.
Applied scientifically and slowly.
Very, very slowly.
- What do you want?
- We're activating the bombs.
- You said you wanted to be told.
- Oh, yes.
A private little matter between
the young woman and myself.
Go!
Do not live in hope, my dear.
There is no one to rescue you.
Now go on!
It's a good thing
the homing capsule he swallowed...
is still working.
Straight ahead.
Go right.
That's him!
Hold it!
Up.
Get your radio man
on to Orlando Beach.
Warn them the target is Miami.
Also, the bomb is transferred
from the Disco Volante...
onto a wreck off Fowley Point.
Right. Hang on to that.
And the kitchen sink.
On you, everything looks good.
Take this.
Good luck.
- Weigh anchor!
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Make smoke.
- Making smoke now.
- Stand by for conversion.
- Standing by.
Jettison cocoon.
Cocoon's away.
Keep firing! They're closing!
Fire more, more!
Wait a minute.
We've still got one bomb aboard.
He's gone mad!
Please talk to them for me.
Tell them that I only did what
I had to do, what I was told to do.
- Where is he?
- The bomb cannot be exploded now.
I threw the arming device
into the sea.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Get him!
- I'm glad I killed him.
- You're glad?
- Who's he?
- I don't know, but he helped me.
- Look out! The rocks!
- The reef!
He's jammed the controls!
Come on!
- Come on, now, jump!
- I never learned to swim!
Never too late to learn.
Get down!
Up.
Calling Cape Comm.
This is Jupiter 16.
Do you give a "go" for fourth orbit?
Cape Comm to Jupiter 16.
Can you confirm O-2 pressure
is within limit?
Roger. Everything looks good
in the environmental control system.
Okay.
Everything looks good from here.
You have a "go" for fourth orbit.
Jupiter 16. Roger.
We're stowing all loose gear,
ready for the E. V.A.
Jupiter 16, this is Cape Comm.
Start your E.V.A. When ready.
You have plenty of time
in the other E.V.A. S for experiments.
- So don't stay out too long, Chris.
- Okay, Flight.
- Don't worry. We'll stick to plan.
- Roger.
Cape Comm to Jupiter 16.
On my mark...
... it will be 4 plus 3-7.
Four, three, two, one.
Mark.
Cape Comm, this is Chris. I am out.
Everything looks okay.
Good. The manoeuver unit
is working this time.
I used it to get out,
and it makes things a lot easier.
Cape Comm to Hawaii. This is
Flight Control. Come in, please.
Hawaii. Roger.
Hawaii, we expect to start E. V.A.
Over your station on this pass.
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.
There is an unidentified object
closing on you fast from astern.
Can you see it?
Hawaii, we have nothing here.
Hold while we check the space track.
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.
Repeat. Hawaii to Jupiter 16.
There is an unidentified object
on our scope closing fast.
We see nothing.
Can you give me a bearing?
Appears to be coming up fast
from astern.
Hey, now I see it.
It's another spacecraft!
I repeat, it's another spacecraft!
Chris, this is Mike.
Does it look like it's moving past?
You're breaking up. Say again.
- Does it look like it's moving past?
- Chris, what's happening?
It's coming right at us!
The front is opening up!
I repeat! The front is opening up!
It's coming right at us!
Get back in! Get back in!
Do you read me?
You're breaking up!
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.
Are you receiving?
- We're breaking up.
- Come in, please. Over.
My lifeline is cut...
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.
Are you receiving me?
Come in, please. Over.
Houston? We've lost all radio contact.
We've also lost him on the scope.
Unidentified object is still orbiting.
Alert all stations
and track him closely.
It is ridiculous
for the Soviet government...
...to deny responsibility
in this matter.
The Soviet government denies
all knowledge of this affair.
The world knows
we are a peace-Ioving people.
I hereby give notice
that in 20 days time...
...the United States intends to launch
her next spaceship into orbit.
My government has instructed me
to inform you...
...that any interference...
...will be regarded as an act of war.
May I ask what motive...
...our Russian friends would have...
...for wishing to destroy
American spacecraft?
My government sees this as
nothing less than a blatant attempt...
...to gain complete control
of space itself for military purposes.
We don't agree.
Her Majesty's government
is not convinced...
...that this intruder missile
originated from Soviet Russia.
A tracking station in Singapore
reported faint echoes of this craft...
...coming down in
the Sea of Japan area.
Might I suggest, gentlemen,
that this is where...
...you should concentrate
your intelligence forces.
The prime minister has asked to assure
you, this is what we propose to do.
As a matter of fact, our man
in Hong Kong is working on it now.
Why do Chinese girls taste different
from all other girls?
You think we better, huh?
No, just different...
...like Peking duck is different
from Russian caviar.
- But I love them both.
- Darling, I give you very best duck.
Well, that would be lovely.
We've had some interesting
times together.
I'll be sorry to go.
Check that door.
The bed.
We're too late.
Well, at least he died on the job.
He'd have wanted it this way.
- The troubled sea.
That must all be changed.
In a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye...
...at the last trumpet...
...for the trumpet shall sound, and the
dead shall be raised incorruptible...
...and we shall all be changed.
We commit his body to the deep
to be turned into corruption...
...Iooking for the resurrection
of the body...
...when the sea
shall give up her dead.
Present!
Fire!
- Carry on.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Request permission to come aboard.
- Permission granted.
Thank you.
- Take this officer aft.
- Yes, sir.
- Take her up 90 feet, across 0-4-5.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Hello, Penny.
- You better go right in.
You're late as usual,
even from your own funeral.
Well, we corpses have
absolutely no sense of time.
- In you go, sir.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Sit down, 007.
- Thank you, sir.
- No ill effects?
- None at all, sir.
Now that you're dead,
perhaps some of your old friends...
...will pay less attention
to you for a while.
Give you more elbow room.
You'll need it too.
This is the big one, 007.
That's why I'm out here myself.
- I take it you're fully briefed.
- Yes, sir.
But there's one thing
I don't understand.
If our Singapore tracking station
is correct...
...about the rocket not landing
in Russia, where did it land?
We assume it's Japan.
Mind you, all this is pure guesswork.
But the PM wants us to play it
with everything we've got.
- And the aerial reconnaissance?
- Every inch photographed. Nothing.
Are the Japanese equipped
to launch such a rocket?
- We don't think so.
- Then who else is?
That's what you've gotta find out fast,
before the real shooting starts.
This damn thing could blow up
into a full-scale war.
When you get to Tokyo,
go to that name and address.
Our man Henderson
will contact you there.
Captain here.
We're underway. Full ahead.
Right.
- Well, that's all.
- Thank you, sir.
- 007.
- Sir?
We've only three weeks before
the Americans launch the next one.
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes, sir.
My sources tell me the Russians
are planning one earlier than that.
So move fast, 007.
Yes, sir.
By the way, how was the girl?
Which girl?
The Chinese one
we fixed you up with.
Another five minutes,
I would've found out.
She'll never know what she missed.
Miss Moneypenny.
Give 007 the password
we've agreed with Japanese S.I.S.
Yes, sir.
We tried to think of something
that you wouldn't forget.
Yes?
"I love you."
Repeat it, please,
to make sure you get it.
Don't worry. I get it.
James. Good luck.
Instant Japanese. You may need it.
You forget I took a first
in Oriental languages at Cambridge.
Stand by to load.
Good to launch.
Tube readied.
Out cab open.
Fire!
This is your ticket.
Thank you.
I love you.
I have a car nearby.
Where do you suggest we go?
I know a quiet hotel.
And?
Where your friend is waiting.
Mr. Henderson.
Wasn't Mr. Henderson
able to come himself?
- I suppose not.
- Why?
He didn't say.
Well, I think it's about hotel time.
How long have you been working
for Henderson?
Long enough to learn not to discuss
such matters with strangers.
- Mr. Henderson's waiting for you.
- You're not coming in with me?
Mr. Henderson
would like to see you alone.
Do come in.
Mr. Henderson?
At your service.
I believe you wanted
to ask me some questions.
Yes. Excuse me.
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you got it right.
I lost that in Singapore in '42.
You must excuse this
rather odd mixture of styles...
...but I refuse to go
entirely Japanese.
I'm very fond
of some of these old things.
You've never been to Japan before,
have you?
No, never.
I myself have lived here for...
...28 years...
...and I'm just beginning
to know my way about.
Your most vital contact
will be Tanaka.
He's head of
the Japanese Secret Service...
...and his identity is the most
closely guarded secret in Japan.
When can I see him?
- You can see Tiger tonight.
- Tiger?
His closest friends
are permitted to call him that.
- Do you have any leads of your own?
- Yes, I do.
That's stirred, not shaken.
That was right, wasn't it?
Perfect.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Russian vodka. Well done.
I get it from the doorman
at the Russian embassy...
...amongst certain other things.
Now, look.
I think London's theory
about the missile being fired...
...from this country is right.
I don't know how or where, and
don't ask me who's doing it either.
But I have a fairly shrewd idea...
...that a major foreign power
is behind it all.
You mean apart from
Russia and Japan?
It's not Russia, old boy.
I'm sure of that.
It's not Japan either.
Although a large Japanese
industrial concern, it...
Good evening.
Cheers.
Siamese vodka?
Get in, quick!
Now, what the hell's the score?
What do you mean?
My job is to help you.
Like you helped Henderson?
I'm taking you to a place of safety.
No, this time I'm taking you.
I want some information.
I want it now.
- I have no information to give you.
- We'll see about that. Slow down.
Welcome.
Welcome to Japan, Mr. Bond.
It is a great pleasure
to meet you at last.
And how do you like
our country so far?
I am a trifle disappointed at the ease
with which I could pull you in.
The one thing my honorable mother
told me long ago...
...was never to get into a car
with a strange girl.
But you, I'm afraid,
will get into anything with any girl.
I must say, you have a lot of energy
for a dead man, Mr. Bond.
You are James Bond, aren't you?
I am so very pleased to meet you.
I really am.
Permit me to introduce myself.
My name is Tanaka.
Please call me Tiger.
If you're Tanaka,
how do you feel about me?
I love you.
I'm glad we got that out of the way.
I'd like you to examine these
as soon as possible.
They're from Osato's safe.
This is an order for naval stores.
- What is lox?
- It's American smoked salmon.
But it's also the technical name
for liquid oxygen...
...which makes rocket fuel.
- Very interesting. We must go.
The journey out will be
more dignified than the journey in.
That wouldn't be difficult.
- I'd like that negative enlarged.
- Okay.
My private train.
I never travel in the streets of Tokyo.
In my position,
it would be most unwise.
Very convenient.
I imagine your Mr. M in London
has a similar arrangement.
M? Oh, yes. But of course.
Then the girl in the white sports car
is one of us.
- Aki?
- Yes. Very competent.
Do you like Japanese saki,
or would you prefer a vodka martini?
Oh, no. I like saki.
Especially when it's served
at the correct temperature...
...98.4 degrees Fahrenheit,
like this is.
For a European,
you are exceptionally cultivated.
- We'll see the photograph you found.
- Good.
It's just a ship and a strip of land.
Could be anywhere.
My men found a microdot
on the paper.
Enlarge.
It says, "Photograph taken...
...by female American tourist
from coastal vessel.
The woman has been liquidated
as a routine precaution."
- Can we see the photograph again?
- Of course.
So they killed an innocent tourist
for taking this?
Can you make it bigger?
Ning-Po.
Check motor vessel Ning-Po,
full details.
All recent movements
and present whereabouts.
- What's that on the left?
- Focus on the left.
- Diving girls.
- Can you identify that coastline?
Given time, yes.
- Who is the head of Osato Chemicals?
- Mr. Osato.
Can you arrange an appointment
with him tomorrow?
Of course. But tonight,
consider my house yours...
...including all of my possessions,
naturally.
My friend, now you take
your first civilized bath.
Really? I like the plumbing.
Place yourself entirely
in their hands.
Rule number one is
never do anything for yourself...
...when someone else
can do it for you.
- And number two?
- Rule number two?
In Japan, men always come first.
Women come second.
I might just retire to here.
Your English girls would
never perform this simple service.
I think I know one or two
who might get around to it.
Miss Moneypenny, perhaps?
We have our sources, just like you.
Don't get the soap in my eye,
will you?
I suppose you know what it is
about you that fascinates them.
It's the hair on your chest.
Japanese men...
...all have beautiful bare skin.
Japanese proverb say:
Bird never make nest in bare tree.
If Henderson's theory is right...
...why would a foreign power
want to launch missiles from Japan?
Because if ever they were discovered,
they could deny all responsibility...
...especially if some private
organization's doing the work.
- Osato?
- Perhaps.
Mr. Osato is one of
the greatest industrialists in Japan.
- He's merely a front.
- Who is big enough?
- SPECTRE.
- Could be.
Now, massage.
Which girl do you select?
I'll just settle for this little lady.
Good choice.
She's very "sexyful."
The last time someone gave me
a massage was in Hong Kong.
But unfortunately,
we had to cut it short.
We were rudely interrupted
by a couple of gunmen.
So we never got around
to finishing it.
This time, you shall finish it.
Aki.
No one will disturb you tonight.
I think I will enjoy very much
serving under you.
Mr. Fisher? This way, please.
Thank you.
Please come in, Mr. Fisher.
Mr. Osato is expecting you.
Thank you.
You are three and a half minutes early.
Please be seated.
- How do you do, Mr. Fisher?
- How do you do?
Miss Brandt,
my confidential secretary.
- Hello.
- Hello.
May we offer you
a glass of champagne?
No, thank you. It's too early for me.
- You're quite sure?
- Quite sure.
I always take a glass in the morning.
- You should try it.
- Isn't it bad for your liver?
Nonsense.
It adds a sparkle to the day.
Sure it does.
A Dom Perignon '59, Mr. Fisher.
Are you sure
you won't change your mind?
Well, if you insist.
Please be seated, Mr. Fisher.
Thank you.
So you are the new managing director
of Empire Chemicals.
- What happened to Williamson?
- Williamson?
Ah, yes.
He died rather suddenly, poor chap.
From what?
He fell into a pulverizer at the works.
How shocking.
A very honorable death,
all the same.
He gained great face
with the company.
I hope you are not taking
any risks yourself.
Me? I never take any risks.
You forgive me for saying so, but...
...I think you are taking one now.
I am?
You should give up smoking.
Cigarettes are very bad
for your chest.
Mr. Osato believes
in a healthy chest.
- Really?
- Now, then.
You must tell me
what I can do for you.
We're interested in the bulk buying
of fermentation chemicals.
Monsodium glutamate
and ascorbic acid.
Would you like a license
to manufacture?
Yes, very much.
So, I'll have my sales manager
get quotations...
...on the delivery dates for you
as soon as possible.
We'll contact you later today
at your hotel.
- Which hotel are you staying at?
- The Hilton.
Goodbye, Mr. Fisher.
A pleasure to meet you.
Pleasure to meet you too.
- Goodbye, Miss Brandt.
- Goodbye, Mr. Fisher.
Kill him.
Get down!
Come in, 2-9-4.
We are being chased by gunmen
in black sedan.
I'm heading south for Highway 2.
Arrange usual reception, please.
How's that for Japanese efficiency?
Just a drop in the ocean.
- 0- 0.
- Yes, Tiger.
Motor vessel Ning-Po
is owned by Osato Chemicals.
Go on.
Vessel at present loading
in Kobe docks.
Sailing for Shanghai
at 5:00 p.m. This afternoon.
Suggest you proceed immediately
to look her over.
- Can we make it?
- Yes, just.
Proceeding immediately
Kobe docks.
Tiger, contact M.
Tell him to send Little Nellie.
Repeat: Little Nellie.
Suggest she be accompanied
by her father.
Most urgent. Understood?
Understood.
Condensation ice-cold.
Liquid oxygen.
Get out of here. Contact Tanaka.
I'm not leaving you.
Tell him to keep that ship shadowed
wherever she goes.
Go now.
Take him to Number 11.
- Wake him up.
- Are you finished?
Where am I?
You're in my cabin on the Ning-Po.
Leave him to me, now.
Wait in there, and shut the door.
I've got you now.
Well, enjoy yourself.
- Who are you working for?
- Empire Chemicals. You know that.
- Do all their people carry guns?
- When they're abroad, yes.
And why were you snooping
around the docks?
I like ships,
and I used to be a sailor.
You are a liar.
- Do you know what this is?
- I'd rather not.
Plastic surgeons call it a dermatome.
They use it to slice off skin.
I hope you won't force me to use it.
Well, what's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?
I have a confession to make.
What?
Actually, I'm a spy.
I know that.
I suppose you know that
industrial secrets are big business.
I've stolen Osato's new process
for making monosodium glutamate.
And...
Well, it's worth $300,000.
So?
I'll split it with you if you
get me out of here and back to Tokyo.
That's a nice offer.
How about it?
- I'm afraid not.
- Why?
Osato would kill me.
We could fly to Europe tomorrow,
you and I.
The things I do for England.
You're going to need some very close
protection tonight in Tokyo...
...because that's when
they'll try and get at you.
You'll need the best man we've got.
And who do you suggest?
Well, me.
I'm afraid I have another
appointment tonight, Mr. Fisher.
I'm awfully sorry to leave you,
but I have to get off.
Chasing girls will be the end of you.
I have told you that before.
He didn't chase her.
He did it so I could get away.
He wouldn't touch that horrible girl.
You wouldn't, would you?
Oh, heaven forbid. Any progress?
Yes. We have identified
the coastline in the photograph.
It is an island called Matsu...
...and lies on the direct route
between Kobe and Shanghai.
We shadowed the Ning-Po
in a helicopter.
- Did it stop at the island?
- I think so.
It was a very dark night.
Impossible to see her all the time.
But we know she stopped
somewhere. Look at these.
That one we took last night.
And that one early this morning.
- Notice the waterline.
- You're right.
Fully laden here, and empty here.
I want to take a fast look
at the island now.
- Has Little Nellie arrived?
- Yes, and her father.
Welcome to Japan, Dad.
Is my little girl hot and ready?
I've had a long and tiring journey,
probably to no purpose.
I'm in no mood
for your juvenile quips.
I have my curiosity.
What is Little Nellie?
She's a wonderful girl.
Very small. Quite fast.
Can do anything. Just your type.
A toy helicopter?
No, it's certainly not a toy.
You'll see.
We've made
one or two improvements.
- I'll give you the drill.
- This can only be for children.
Don't use it.
Take my helicopter instead.
Right. Now, pay attention.
- Two machine guns, fixed.
incinerators and high explosives.
Two rocket launchers.
Forward firing on either side.
Now, these fire
heat-seeking air-to-air missiles.
- Sixty a minute.
- Good.
Flame guns, two of them,
firing astern.
- What range?
- Eighty yards.
Two smoke ejectors
next door to them.
Aerial mines. Now, remember.
Use them only when
directly above target.
That's about the lot, I think.
You know the rest, don't you?
Yes.
Cine-camera.
- Tanaka, listen in on 410 megacycles.
- Good luck.
I'll contact you
when I get over the island.
- Okay.
- Be careful.
Hello, Base One.
I'm over the island now.
I've seen the fishing village.
Nothing to report.
Roger. We'll keep listening.
Hello, Base One.
- There's nothing here but volcanoes.
- Understood.
Carry on.
- Hello, Base One.
- Listening.
Little Nellie got a hot reception.
Four big shots made
improper advances towards her.
But she defended her honor
with great success.
- Heading for home.
- Do not come home.
Russian space shot imminent.
Proceed vector 4-6 degrees
and await instructions.
- Understood
- Roger and out.
Clear the area.
Prepare for reception.
Radar blackout is now complete.
Moscow radio is already saying
that we did it.
The president's called
a press conference for 2 p.m.
He'll deny our involvement.
- But can we prove it?
- Of course we can't.
The world won't believe the Russians
destroyed their own spacecraft.
They'll use the excuse
to shoot down our next Jupiter.
Houston to Washington.
We followed him for one orbit,
now he's gone off the screen.
- That means he's coming down.
- Yeah, but where?
Someplace in Russia. It has to be.
The British theory about Japan
is nonsense.
- Forget Japan.
- I agree.
We rephotographed
every square inch.
Ventilator fans to full power.
Open all air ducts.
Area safe to enter.
All crews to stations.
All air ducts to normal.
Air ducts open.
- Close crater.
- Closing crater.
Fire guards to station.
Ventilator fans to normal.
Open shutters.
Reception complete.
Withdraw captive spaceship.
Guards to stations.
- Remove the prisoners.
- Remove the prisoners.
I shall be in my apartment.
I may send for you later.
I must congratulate you, gentlemen,
upon your superb equipment.
We congratulate you
on how you handle it.
Our clients are satisfied
with the progress so far?
- My government is quite satisfied.
- Good.
Hans.
You will see that my piranha fish
get very hungry.
They can strip a man
to the bone in 30 seconds.
I have decided to ask
for a little money in advance.
I want the sum of a hundred
million dollars in gold bullion...
...deposited in our account
in Buenos Aires.
Our agreement states quite clearly
that no money should be paid...
...until war has broken out between
Russia and the United States.
- This is extortion.
- Extortion is my business.
Think it over, gentlemen. I'm busy.
Osato and Number 11, report now.
An unknown Englishman
was in your office the other day.
Correct, Number One.
- Do you know what gun this is?
- Walther PPK.
Only one person we know
uses this sort of gun.
James Bond.
- But Bond is dead.
- It was in all the newspapers.
Rubbish. Bond is alive.
Unless you killed him, Mr. Osato.
Don't tell me you let him go.
I gave Number 11 the strictest orders
to eliminate him.
- And did she?
- She failed.
You should have killed him yourself.
You had plenty of opportunity.
This organization
does not tolerate failure.
- I know, but...
- Go.
Well?
Kill Bond, now!
Yes, Number One. Yes.
- Hello.
- Bad news from outer space.
Yes, I heard it. Now the Russians
are accusing the Americans.
Next time it will be war.
- We'll have to get to those volcanoes.
- I agree.
We'll also need a company
of first-rate men.
Do you have any commandos here?
I have much, much better.
Ninjas. Top secret, Bond-san.
This is my ninja training school.
- Ninjas?
- The art of concealment and surprise.
This must develop
very fast reflex actions.
And spiritual strength.
Now we will see some modern ninjas.
My plan is this:
I make a base on the Ama Island.
One hundred of my ninjas
will slide in unseen.
They will be workers and fishermen.
- What about me?
- Later.
For the moment,
these will interest you. Rocket guns.
Very powerful. See the little holes
in the back for jet propulsion?
- It's a fine gun.
- All rocket guns.
This is our special baby rocket.
It's useful for people who
smoke too many cigarettes like you.
- Accurate up to 30 yards.
- Very neat.
It can save your life, this cigarette.
You sound like a commercial.
- What's the plan for me?
- First, you become a Japanese.
Second, you train hard and quickly
to become a ninja like us.
And third, to give you
extra special cover...
...you take a wife.
Regretfully impossible.
You must marry Ama girl,
one who is known on the island.
Is she pretty?
- She has a face like a pig.
- To hell with that idea.
But this is duty.
The girl I have chosen
is an agent of mine.
But first, you must
become Japanese.
Why don't you just dye
the parts that show?
Tiger said from now on, you must
do everything in Japanese style.
Everything?
Good for Tiger.
Aki.
She's dead.
Poisoned.
Tiger, we must get to that island.
You're almost ready.
Just two more days' training.
- You killed him.
- He tried to kill me.
This man is a stranger from outside.
Lucky we're getting out of here.
Tomorrow you will be a poor Japanese
worker with humble Japanese wife.
Yeah, with a face like a pig.
My men are already ashore,
all over the island.
We have four days left.
It is not much time.
This is my house.
My friend has made us some food.
- Do you live here alone?
- Yes. My parents are dead.
Sit down, please.
Oysters.
Is this the only room there is?
Yes. That is your bed.
I shall sleep over there.
We're supposed to be married.
Think again, please.
You gave false name to priest.
Yes, but we must keep up
appearances. It's our honeymoon.
No honeymoon. This is business.
Well, I won't need these.
What's wrong?
The Americans have changed
the launching date.
The countdown has already started.
The president spoke on television.
He gave a last warning to Russia.
- When does it go up?
- Tonight, midnight, our time.
- Did your men search the island?
- Nothing.
Except volcanoes.
Everything is so normal around here.
- Nothing happens.
- One thing has happened.
Yesterday an Ama girl
rode her boat into Rosaki.
- Rosaki?
- It is a big cave on the mainland.
And when her boat floated out again,
she was dead.
- Was that the funeral we saw?
- Yes.
- How did she die?
- Nobody knows.
- Can you take me to this cave?
- Yes.
We'll slip away from the fishing fleet
in the morning.
All right?
- Now, where is this cave?
- It's straight across.
The cave is over there.
Gas. Get over the side. Quick.
Phosgene gas
to keep the visitors away.
Did you notice
the sulfur on the walls?
- The yellow?
- Yes.
It was once an underground outlet
for the lava from the volcano.
- There must be a long tunnel.
- Miles of it.
It leads all the way.
Right up to the top there.
That's where we have to go next.
Can you make it?
Of course. It's business.
Good.
- May I rest a moment?
- Surely.
It's hard work.
Some honeymoon.
It's going down into the volcano.
Heliport to position.
The honeymoon's over. Come on.
- This volcano isn't active, is it?
- It never has been.
Not in my lifetime.
There's been
some terrific heat here recently.
What happened to the helicopter?
It's down there somewhere.
Come on.
Stand by. Mark.
Stand by for ten-second countdown.
Ten, nine, eight...
All units will remain
at instant readiness...
- ... five, four...
...while the spacecraft is in orbit.
... three, two, one.
Ignition.
This is it, gentlemen.
All we can do now is wait and pray.
- Is that deep?
- They usually are, very.
It's metal.
Wait here.
Heliport to takeoff position.
Open crater.
Emergency crews to stations.
Get back to Tanaka. Tell him
to come with every man he's got.
Yes.
Heliport to standby position.
Astronauts to dressing rooms.
Attention! Attention! American
target vehicle is now in orbit.
Interception will take place
in two hours' time.
Washington, this is Houston.
Houston to Washington.
Our vehicle is now
120 nautical miles altitude...
... 170 miles downrange.
Jupiter to Houston,
we now have second phase.
Roger, Jupiter.
We are now four hours
plus 36 minutes into the mission.
- Can you give us a time, Mac?
- Roger.
Connect ignitor cable.
Radar technicians
report to control room.
T minus 100 minutes and counting.
Did you guys volunteer
for astronaut training?
In our country, we say cosmonaut.
Yes, sir. Both of us, we...
- six months, we've started training.
Good evening.
- Who the hell are you?
- Stand back. I'm gonna blow the lock.
Stand back.
Get into their uniforms.
Astronauts have two minutes.
Repeat. Two minutes.
Reserve astronaut to standby.

We now have

You made a mistake, my friend.
No astronaut would enter the capsule
carrying his air conditioner.
Remove his helmet.
James Bond.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
They told me you were assassinated
in Hong Kong.
Yes, this is my second life.
You only live twice.
Target vehicle
passing over Central Russia...
...approaching Mongolia.
Track is as predicted.
As you see, I'm about to inaugurate

In a matter of hours, when America and

You can watch it all on TV.
It's the last program

Well, if I'm going to be forced
to watch television, may I smoke?
Yes, give him his cigarettes.
It won't be the nicotine
that kills you, Mr. Bond.
Armed guards to control room.
- Close the crater.

I shall look forward personally

Close the shutters.
We are now impregnable.
Interception will occur in 8 minutes.
Nothing can prevent that.
Impregnable?

You are to assume full control

Interception will occur

This is the price of failure, Mr. Bond.
Come on.
Goodbye, Mr. Bond.
There's an exploder button
up in the control room.
- We've got to get up there.
- Impossible! Too well defended!
Evacuate the control.
Control Room technicians.
There must be another way up there.
Give me cover

Bon appetit.
Closing fast on our vehicle.

All units stand by for code word.
Code word is "imminent."
I repeat. Closing fast on our vehicle.
It was blown up! The enemy!
I repeat...
The enemy has blown up.
All units will return to first alert.
Code word is "not,"
I say again "not imminent."
We've done it.
Steady.
Now, about that honeymoon.
Why not?
But they'll never let you stay.
But they'll never find us.
He's on board, sir.
- Tell him to come below and report.
- It'll be a pleasure, sir.
I've been saying for years, sir,
that our equipment is obsolete.
And now computer analysis reveals an
entirely new approach: Miniaturisation.
For instance, radioactive lint.
When placed in an opponent's pockets
the antipersonnel and
location fix seems obvious.
What we want is a location fix on 007.
Number Ten's making ugly noises
about Operation Bedlam.
Miss Moneypenny,
did you check with Communications?
Replies to our Cairo
and Madrid enquiries: All negative, sir.
The PM wants to be informed
personally when we find 007.
No!
Good morning!
My name's Bond. James Bond.
Miss erm...
Don't move, Mr Bond.
Now get up!
Put your hands behind your head. Move!
Get in!
Lie down!
Argh!
This never happened to the other fellow.
- Your bagages, sir?
- In the boot.
- Take care of those gloves.
- Right, sir.
- Commander Bond, how are you?
- Fine. Good to see you, Manuel.
Quinhentos e cinquenta e seis.
Everything seems up to
the Palcio's standards.
Yes, it's a good season.
That red Cougar outside.
Does it belong to a lady?
Yes, sir. Contessa Teresa di Vicenzo.
Che bella!
Our best!
Fortunately, we have had a cancellation.
Allow me.
Mm.
This'll do. This'll do me nicely.
I'm sure we can look after
your special needs.
I'm sure you can. Thank you.
Huit. la banque.

- Madame?
- I don't have the money.
- Je regrette, mais c'est impossible.
- I regret too, but I don't have any money.
- Dame can't pay up.
- OK, madame, venez avec moi.
- S'il vous plat, madame?
- Forgive me. My mind was elsewhere.
Madame has forgotten
we agreed to be partners this evening.
- Please continue.
- Merci.
Well, that's a bit of luck, being bailed out
like that at the last minute!
Waiter.
- Dom Prignon '57.
- Sir.
Why do you persist
in rescuing me, Mr Bond?
It's becoming a habit,
isn't it, Contessa Teresa?
Teresa was a saint. I'm known as Tracy.
Well, Tracy, next time
play it safe and stand on five.
People who want to stay alive play it safe.
Please stay alive.
At least for tonight.
Come later.
I hope it'll be worth it,
partner.
Monsieur.
- Send it to suite 423 with caviar for two.
- Oui, monsieur.
Tracy.
Tracy?
Argh!
Gate-crasher. I'll leave you to tidy up.
Mm, royal beluga. North of the Caspian.
- You're full of surprises, Contessa.
- So are you, Mr Bond.
Do you always arm yourself
for a rendezvous?
Occasionally. I seem
to be accident-prone.
I'll take that, if you don't mind.
You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Suppose I were to kill you for a thrill.
I can think of something
more sociable to do.
Will you stop playing games?
Who was that man in your room?
- You're hurting me.
- I thought that was the idea.
- Who was he?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I can be a lot more persuasive.
- I'm sure you can.
Whatever else I may be, I'm not a liar.
Get dressed.
You're the most extraordinary girl.
I'm not interested
in your opinion of me, Mr Bond.
- I'm here for a business transaction.
- Really?
Isn't Le Bleu a bit heady for that?
So, you know your perfumes.
What else do you know?
A little about women.
Think about me
as a woman you've just bought.
Who needs to buy?
Look, you don't owe me a thing.
I think you're in some sort of trouble.
Would you like to talk about it?
No, Mr Bond.
The only thing you need know about me
is that I pay my debts.
20,000 francs is a lot of money.
Mm.
Good morning.
- Morning. Caf for two with orange juice.
- Yes, sir.
- Connect me with suite 423, please.
- The Countess has left the hotel, sir.
- Checked out?
- A few minutes ago.
Thank you.
Paid in full as well.
- Mr Bond?
- Yes.
- You've lost something.
- Really?
We'll give it to you outside.
Why not? Perhaps
we can make up a foursome!
You've thought of everything. What a
lovely surprise, meeting again so soon!
- Mm.
- Thank you.
- And where's the party this time?
- You have an appointment.
Business or pleasure?
Mystery tour, eh?
I think we'd all enjoy it more without that.
Mmm.
Basta!
Do not kill me, Mr Bond.
At least not until we've had a drink.
Then if you wish,
I'll give you another chance.
I'm Draco of Draco Construction.
Mm-hm.
- But today is the 13th, Commander.
- I'm superstitious.
- A martini for our guest, Olympe.
- A pleasure.
- Shaken, not stirred.
- Of course.
- Campari for me.
- Mm-hm.
My apologies for the way you were
brought here today. Please sit down.
I was not sure
you would accept a formal invitation.
There's always something formal
about the point of a pistol.
Thank you, chrie.
- Olympe, we will finish our struggle later.
- As you wish.
She also plays
a very good game of chess.
- Salute.
- Cheers.
You usually drink Corsican brandy.
Ah! What else do you know about me?
Marc Ange Draco. Head of Union Corse,
one of Europe's biggest crime syndicates.
- The biggest.
- Not quite.
An organisation known as SPECTRE
operates worldwide.
However, your legitimate business fronts
are more extensive.
Construction, electrical supplies,
numerous agricultural holdings.
Your dossier on me
is not entirely complete.
I am also Teresa's father.
- Tracy?
- Yes, Tracy. Tracy.
My only child.
Her mother was an English girl -
romantic -
who had come to Corsica
to look for bandits.
Rather like those women who ventured
into the desert looking for sheikhs.
She found me in the mountains.
Hiding from the police at the time.
I came to love this girl.
We married. The result: Teresa.
Twelve years later my wife died.
I sent Teresa to Switzerland
- No, thanks. I prefer my own.
- To finish her education.
Unfortunately I didn't give her a proper
home. She was without supervision.
So
she joined the fast international set.
One scandal after another.
When I disapproved,
cut off her allowance,
she committed some greater folly.
To spite me.
Yet, behind her bravado,
something was eating away at her soul.
This can happen to men and women.
They burn the heart out of themselves
by living too greedily.
And suddenly,
- all is finished.
- Why are you telling me this?
Without telling me, she married. An Italian
count who killed himself in a Maserati
with one of his mistresses.
I gave her too much,
and it brought her nothing.
Now, why did I tell you all this?
I have been informed of everything
you have done for my daughter.
- Everything?
- Don't worry, don't worry about that.
What you did, the way you behaved,
might be the beginning
of some kind of therapy.
She needs help.
Your help.
I find her fascinating,
but she needs a psychiatrist, not me.
What she needs is a man to dominate her.
To make love to her enough
to make her love him.
A man like you.
You overestimate me, Draco.
She's very attractive,
but what you ask is not for me.
Mm.
Listen to me. On the day you marry her,
I'll give you a personal dowry
of one million pounds
in gold.
That's quite an inducement.
- But I don't need a million pounds.
- Stupido!
And I've a bachelor's taste for freedom.
Please, just see her some more.
Who knows what will come of it?
I'm sorry, Draco,
but in my profession, I can't...
- What?
- You have connections not open to me.
Where is Ernst Stavro Blofeld?
Blofeld?
Some of my men
have recently defected to him.
- I don't know where he is.
- Can you find out?
If I could, I wouldn't tell
Her Majesty's Secret Service.
But I might tell my future son-in-law.
Go on.
Next week is my birthday.
For that,
Teresa always comes back to me.
- You understand?
- Let's say I'll sleep on the idea.
You do that.
- James! Where have you been?
- Much too far from you, darling.
Oh, same old James!
Ooh! Only more so.
Heartless brute! Letting me pine away
without even a postcard.
Pine no more.
Cocktails at my place,
eightish, just the two of us.
Oh, I'd adore that!
If only I could trust myself.
Same old Moneypenny.
Britain's last line of defence.
You'd better go in.
He's running a very tight ship today.
I'm relieving you
from Operation Bedlam, 007.
But, sir, Blofeld's
something of a must with me.
You've had two years to run him down.
- Have you lost confidence in me?
- I'm well aware of your talents, 007.
But a licence to kill is useless,
unless one can set up the target.
- Sir...
- I'll find you a more suitable assignment.
- Under the circumstances...
- That's all!
That was a quick conference.
- How can a girl keep herself alluring...
- Take a memo, please, Moneypenny.
Ready, James.
Sir, I have the honour to request
if you'll accept my resignation
effective forthwith.
- Resignation from what?
- Her Majesty's Secret Service.
And kindly present it
to that monument in there.
Underneath de mango tree
Me honey and me
come watch for de moon...
Sorry, ma'am.
- 007... James Bond here.
- He wants you, James.
Request granted.
Request granted. Not even with regret.
What did you expect? A knighthood?
Why don't you read it?
Two weeks' leave!
Well, you didn't really
want to resign, did you?
Moneypenny,
what would I do without you?
My problem is that
you never do anything with me.
It's a date. The moment I get back.
- Where are you off to?
- Oh, just some place to laze about.
Beachcombing.
What would I do without you,
Miss Moneypenny? Thank you.
Bonjour, Miguel.
Teresa!
It's so long since we see you!
- Yes, very well.
- There's Tracy.
- Huh?
- Tracy.
Where is she? Ah, there she is!
- Teresa!
- Happy birthday, Papa.
You make it so by being here.
You look marvellous.
There's someone I want you to meet.
- Salut, Olympe. How are you?
- It's good to have you back.
- You look wonderful!
- Thanks.
Bom dia. Bonjour.
Mr Bond, may I introduce
my daughter? Teresa.
Contessa.
- We've already met.
- But each time is a renewed pleasure.
Madame always makes one feel
so welcome!
She likes you, I can see it.
You must give me
the name of your oculist.
Brilliant.
I didn't know Mr Bond knew Papa.
There are many things
about Mr Bond one does not know.
It would be interesting
to attend night school perhaps.
Papa is up to something, I'm sure of it.
Your father loves you very much, Tracy.
Whatever he may arrange,
I know it's for your happiness.
What has Papa arranged?
Ah! Mr Bond.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Many happy returns.
The best years
are still to come, let's hope.
Oh, allow me.
What are you doing here?
Yes, wasn't it kind
of your father to invite me?
Mr Bond and I are discussing business.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
No woman would waste excellent
champagne discussing business.
Unless, of course, she happened
to be part of the arrangement.
Olympe, what have you said?
Don't blame Olympe.
I'm not your daughter for nothing.
I detect a certain family resemblance.
I suggest you revise the terms
of your contract, Mr Bond.
- You'll find your liability too expensive.
- There you're mistaken.
- Papa.
- Yes?
- Mr Bond wants information.
- What are you talking about?
You always taught me
a good host supplies his guest's needs.
- Uh-huh.
- And without obligation.
- And then?
- I'm not sure obligation is the right word.
Tell him, Papa.
Tell him what he wants to know.
- Now!
- Please, please, Teresa.
It's only a possibility, nothing definite.
Tell him, Papa,
or you'll never see me again.
All right.
There may be a connection between
that man Blofeld and the lawyer
with offices in Bern, Switzerland.
- Named Gumbold.
- Gumbold?
- Bern, Switzerland?
- Yes, Gumbold.
So, now Mr Bond need have
no further interest in me.
Another mistake.
She always was a headstrong child.
I'm sorry...
Where has he gone?
Tracy!
Tracy.
I was always taught
that mistakes should be remedied.
Especially between friends.
Or lovers.
We have all the time
In the world
Time enough for life to unfold
All the precious things love has in store
We have all the love
In the world
If that's all we have
You will find
We need nothing more
Every step of the way
Will find us
With the cares of the world
Far behind us
We have all the time
In the world
Just for love
Nothing more
Nothing less
Only love
I'll see to this appointment,
then catch up with you.
- The story of our life, James?
- Just keep my martini cool.
- I will be back in an hour.
- Bon apptit, monsieur.
Ich hab noch ein paar Sachen zu kaufen.
Such things should be left to a girl's
father, who knows what is best for her.
But what can be better than being in love?
Mr Bond, he's... He's in love with you?
That may come too some day.
Life's too short for "some day", Teresa.
Tomorrow I will speak to him alone,
man to man.
- No, Papa.
- Why not?
No talk. Whatever happens,
there'll be no regrets.
Please.
Mm.
Good afternoon, James.
- Afternoon. Is the Admiral in?
- Certainly.
Hm?
Excuse me. Commander Bond to see you.
- Right, show him in.
- Aye aye, sir.
- If you please, sir.
- Thank you.
Unusually small
for a Nymphalis polychloris.
I wasn't aware that your expertise
included lepidoptery.
Anyway, what are you doing here?
Genealogy, sir. Fascinating subject.
Came across a letter from Gebrder
Gumbold, solicitors in Switzerland
to a certain
Count Balthazar de Bleuchamp.
- De Bleuchamp?
- French form of "Blofeld".
You've been relieved from
Operation Bedlam, 007. Remember?
I assumed you'd reassign me, sir.
This is a Photostat copy of a letter
to our College of Arms
in the City of London
with the request they try to establish
de Bleuchamp's claim to the title,
and Sir Hilary Bray
has replied to Gumbold
suggesting that he should meet
de Bleuchamp in person.
I've taken the liberty, sir,
of working with the college on this,
using an examination
of my own family tree as cover.
I've also been reading up
on the technical side of heraldry.
Sir Hilary Bray, please. Commander Bond.
Ah, yes, sir.
So that, should he consent to meet, I can
act as a representative of the college.
Come.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Sir Hilary.
Have a look at this: Arms of Sir Thomas
Bond. Baronet of Peckham. Died 1734.
Argent on a chevron sable.
Three bezants.
Good motto, eh?
"The world is not enough."
- You're doing a splendid job.
- Thank you, Mr Sable Basilisk.
We've traced your line
back to Sir Otho le Bon.
Held the manor of Wickhambreux by a
knight's fee from the Earl of Thanet, 1387.
We're in luck.
Gumbold's telephoned from Bern
to say his client has consented to see me.
- You mean me?
- Yes, you.
But, Commander Bond, I am only able
to countenance this deception
if the matter is of national importance.
I haven't exaggerated.
We appreciate your help.
All right, then. I've arranged to lose myself
amongst the churches of Brittany.
I want to do brass rubbings there anyway.
- Where do I go for this meeting?
- Well, they want a description of myself.
- Tactfully adjusted to favour me.
- Yes.
They will send the time and place
from where I am to be
"collected", as they put it.
It's not our sort of thing,
but under the circumstances...
- Sounds as if they're suspicious.
- No, no, no, not suspicious. Just discreet.
There was no objection to my fee
of a thousand guineas.
- Could their claim be genuine?
- Hard to say. Our methods are exacting.
We never speak until we're absolutely
certain there's no error on our side or
- forgery on anybody else's.
- I hope I live up to your high standards.
One helpful physical point may be that the
real de Bleuchamps are without ear lobes.
It's not the sort of thing we rely on,
but it could help.
- No ear lobes.
- Invite him to Augsburg.
The de Bleuchamps have been
coming from there for generations.
Yes, I'd like to get him
away from Switzerland.
- Sir Hilary Bray, Baronet?
- The same, dear lady.
I'm Frulein Irma Bunt,
personal secretary to the Count.
- Have you had a good journey?
- No, intolerable. I'm not a good traveller.
I'm sorry.
- Grunther will take your luggage.
- I can manage.
- I take it.
- Oh, very well.
You know Switzerland?
- I'm afraid not, Frulein...
- Bunt.
Bunt. Interesting name for a genealogist.
Are you from a naval family?
Naval?
It's a nautical term, you see, meaning
the baggy or swollen parts of a sail.
- Nothing personal, of course.
- Interesting.
- You speak German?
- I'm afraid not.
- French?
- A little. Where are we off to?
You will not be disappointed. Please?
Like the bugs in the rug, yes?
- You are comfortable?
- Yes, indeed, Frulein.
- Your kindness is quite overwhelming.
- Good.
Hup! Komm!
Komm. Komm. Hop!
So, we are halfway.
Now we will have a little flight.
- I've never been in one of these before.
- You must your pipe knock off.
Knock out, you mean?
I hope.
- Mind your head, Sir Hilary.
- Please fasten your safety belt.
Now up into the Alps.
That is avalanche damage.
You enjoy the skiing
or the bobsleigh perhaps?
I'm not a sporting man, Frulein.
Even when I'm at my best.
Do you feel the airsickness?
Up to there is for the public, and
from here upwards it is strictly private.
No one, no one at all
may come through
without permission from the Count.
There is the Bleuchamp Institute
for allergy research.
- What kind of allergies?
- All of them.
Like the hay fever,
or the sickness caused by the oysters,
or inability to eat meat.
The Count is a specialist in this field.
- I'll be glad to get my feet on the ground.
- Not ground. Ice.
Frulein, I should warn you,
guns make me very nervous.
They're to keep away the spies
from the chemical companies.
Many times already
they have tried to steal our discoveries.
Yes, we live in a world
of avarice and deceit.
- Here, at least, there's no avarice.
- Really?
The Bleuchamp Institute
is not for profit, Sir Hilary.
The Count does his work
for the sake of mankind.
Mm, I'm very happy to hear it.
He wants to leave his mark
on the entire world.
- Characteristic ambition.
- Characteristic?
- Of a true humanitarian.
- Ah!
Formerly it was a sports club,
open to the public.
Now it belongs to the Count,
who has given it to scientific research.
Josef, Sir Hilary Bray
will take number four.
I will show you there after Grunther
has taken you for a medical examination.
- I'm quite all right now.
- You are our honoured guest, Sir Hilary.
And after your experience
in the helicopter,
we must make sure
that you are well again.
- Grunther, take Sir Hilary to Dr von Sant.
- Ja, Frulein.
Direktor, bitte.
- Yes?
- Der Englnder ist gekommen.
- Provide him with the usual comforts.
- Ja.
You have ten minutes.
- And then take them to number four.
- Ja.
If you wish anything for your comfort,
you must ring this.
- And the attendant will come.
- Very considerate. Thank you.
You must also ring for him
to open the door
- when you wish to leave.
- A complicated arrangement.
To stop patients leaving their rooms
and disturbing each other
when they should be resting.
The Count believes very strongly
in undisturbed rest.
Prudent fellow. When can I see him?
We have a lot to discuss.
He will send for you, Sir Hilary,
when he's ready.
Meanwhile, I should like you to join me
in the Alpine room before dinner.
- Alpine room?
- Yes.
Grunther will come for you.
Shall we say seven?
Thank you.
Frulein Bunt will receive you.
Tomato juice with lots of lemon.
Hm-hm!
Ah, Sir Hilary!
Please, come to meet our patients.
Ladies, this is Sir Hilary Bray, Baronet.
- How do you do?
- He's a famous genealogist.
- You will have a drink, yes?
- Please, come and sit down.
How do you do?
Thank you.
- What is a baronet?
- It's a kind of inferior baron.
- Oh, how disappointing.
- Well, er...
Oh, I don't mean you're inferior,
I mean the title is.
Yes, but what's a gynae... genealogist?
What is that?
- Pommy word for an old people's doctor.
- Ah! So he's here to cure Frulein Bunt.
Watch out. She has ears like an elephant.
- What will you drink, sir?
- Malt whisky and branch water, please.
I'm sorry I was so rude
about what a baronet is.
You gave a very accurate description.
- Sir.
- Thank you.
It's a treat having a man here for once.
- Er, you mean there aren't any others?
- Only the staff, and you can't count them.
We will not discuss affairs of the clinic.
But what is a genealogist?
Will nobody tell me?
- It would be a pleasure to tell you.
- Well?
Genealogy is all about
ancestors and families.
I mean, it could easily be
that any one of you here
is related to a royal house.
If only we could go back
far enough to find out.
If you tell me your names...
We do not use surnames here.
It is a rule of the clinic.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't know that.
Come, it's time for dinner.
Our schedule is rather strict.
So is our diet.
Sir Hilary, if you would sit there,
between Helen and Ruby.
I'm afraid I've never had
much to do with young ladies.
I have ordered you a steak "Piz Gloria".
- I hope you enjoy it.
- Thank you. I'm sure I will.
- Are you here for Christmas, Sir Hilary?
- Er, well, I might be.
- Oh, good! Then we can have a party.
- That sort of thing's not quite in my line.
Delicious!
I used to hate chicken.
Used to make me break out.
It was all over.
You'd be surprised where.
- Potatoes did it to me. Now I adore them.
- No medical histories, please.
Girls, I'm sure Sir Hilary would like to tell
us about the College of Arms in London.
Go on, Sir Hilary, please tell us.
- If you'd really enjoy that.
- Please. Yes!
Would you?
- Fascinating!
- Tell us all about it.
The Herald's College,
or College of Arms,
consists of 13 members
of the royal household,
appointed by the sovereign
to run armorial, genealogical,
- ceremonial and other matters.
- Mm-hm.
The 13 members
are divided into three categories:
Kings, heralds and pursuivants.
Their titles and offices
are of great antiquity.
...when I tell you the first Clarenceux,
King-of-Arms, was created in 1334
and the first Somerset herald in 1448.
Now, when we authorise a coat of arms,
it can include all sorts of funny things.
Crescent moons, portcullises,
beasts couchant and rampant,
bars, bezants...
Please, what is bezant?
Gold balls.
I brought a book on the subject. There's
a picture of my own coat of arms,
which includes four of them,
If you'd care to see them.
I'd love to. I'm in room...
No, no! He will give the book to me.
I will pass it to everyone in turn.
- It is fairer like that, yes?
- Of course. If you think so, Frulein.
Is anything the matter, Sir Hilary?
Just a slight stiffness coming on
in the shoulder.
Due to the altitude, no doubt.
Der Graf will ihn jetzt sprechen.
The Count will see you now.
Thank you. Please excuse me, ladies.
May all your allergies be swiftly cured.
What a nice man!
Sweet!
Of course, I know what he's allergic to.
Bezants.
Antisepsis.
Please wait here.
- Good evening, Sir Hilary.
- Good evening.
Balthazar, Count de Bleuchamp.
If you'll forgive me,
that's what I'm here to find out.
To confirm, Sir Hilary.
There can be no doubt of the truth.
Please, sit down.
If there were no doubt,
the college would not have sent me.
Well, since you are here,
I'll make everything very plain to you.
To begin with,
I was born without ear lobes.
A well-known congenital
distinction of Bleuchamp ancestry.
Like the Hapsburg lip,
or the hawknose of the Medicis.
Granted, but the fact
you're of de Bleuchamp ancestry
doesn't make you the reigning count.
I feel it in my blood and in my bones.
The college will require
more concrete proofs.
And it shall have them.
I have all the relevant documents:
Title deeds, certificates of birth and death.
They'll be sent to your room
for authentication.
And you've only to ask Frulein Bunt
for anything at all you may require.
- Are you comfortable here?
- Yes, but puzzled by your clinic.
Well, the methods of the great pioneers
have often puzzled conventional minds.
I have devised a cure for allergies
which depends on holding
an unusual and rather delicate
psychological balance.
So, you see, I must impose
special conditions on my patients.
And, erm, your laboratories?
The cure is not entirely
psychological, Sir Hilary.
There are vaccines to be prepared.
Vaccines which must be modified
to suit each individual case.
So, you see, I'm a very busy man.
I might not be able to spare you
as much time as I might wish.
If you wish to be confirmed as the Count,
you must give me some of your time.
I need details of living relatives,
your parents and grandparents.
- The documents you will see...
- Can answer many questions, but not all.
Oh, one more thing.
- Could you accompany me to Augsburg?
- Augsburg?
The ancestral home
of the de Bleuchamp family.
There are notable Bleuchamp tombs, and
important records in the city archives.
If you yourself were there to assist...
That may not be convenient
for some time.
But I'm determined
my title shall be recognised.
- Proceed with your preliminary research.
- I'll be happy to start straightaway.
Thank you, Herr Grunther.
... alle eingeschlossen
sind. Der Gast darf nicht gestrt werden.
Du hast zwar nichts gefunden,
aber bleib wachsam.
- Sir Hilary!
- Shh...
I've brought you the book.
- The illustrated book?
- No, don't turn it on.
- I want to see the pictures.
- But you're a picture yourself.
And twice as lovely in the firelight.
You are funny
at pretending not to like girls.
Well, I don't usually, but you're not usual.
That lipstick was an inspiration.
So are you.
Oh, Sir Hilary!
Call me Hilly.
Hilly.
- What's your name?
- Ruby Bartlett, from Lancashire.
- Morecambe Bay actually.
- How did you get here?
Do we have to talk about that now?
Ooh!
It's true!
How did you get here?
I had this awful allergy about chickens.
My family's got a chicken farm and every
time I did something on it, I nearly died.
The specialist said there was a wonderful
Swiss clinic where they cured you free
because they were researching.
Go on.
- No, about the clinic, I mean.
- Oh!
Well, the specialist had me
meet Frulein Bunt in London
and she said I had
a very interesting case.
How right she was.
Oh, Hilly!
Oh, bother!
No, Hilly.
It's part of the cure.
Cassette number seven.
Number eight.
Do you remember
when you first came here,
how you hated chickens?
How you were sick
when you even saw one?
But all that is over now,
for I have shown you how foolish it was.
And your cure is nearly done.
I have taught you to love chickens.
To love their flesh, their voice.
Yes, your cure is nearly done.
- And soon you will go home
- Ruby!
- To look after the chickens,
- Ruby, wake up!
Which you love so much.
You do love me just a little,
don't you, Hilly?
Ruby?
I must teach you
how to give them special care.
I will tell you what to do.
- Ruby, wake up!
- I will tell you when.
I will tell you how.
And after you've done what I teach you,
you will forget it for ever.
For ever.
Hilly, you old devil.
It is me, yes?
Quite undeniably, yes.
How did you get out?
With a fingernail file.
It's so easy!
Mm, I wouldn't know.
I come to see the book.
The pictures, yes?
Oh, jolly good idea.
Now, where did I put it?
Mm, I had it a few moments ago.
- Perhaps if we turn on the light.
- No!
You're a picture yourself.
And twice as lovely in the firelight.
- But, Sir Hilary...
- Hilly.
But I think you do not like girls, Hilly.
Usually I don't, but you're not usual.
Coming here like this
was an inspiration, and so are you.
Mmm!
- You'll need to be.
- What you say?
I said a miracle our meeting like this.
I don't even know your name.
I tell you all about myself later.
In the morning.
Hey!
What about a lift to the top?
It is not permitted. All is private.
Surely there's a restaurant, a sports club
up there. I've seen them advertised.
- It's all closed down.
- Since when? I've seen them advertised.
You are mistaken, sir.
For many weeks now they are finished.
I'd still like to get to the top.
From here upwards now is forbidden!
Private! Closed!
All right.
Hey!
It's my go now.
Let go!
- Sir Hilary!
- Good morning.
Good morning, Sir Hilary.
Your stiffness of last night, it is all gone?
- For the time being.
- Then come and do curling with us.
- Won't it be frightfully energetic?
- No.
- We will show you.
- You can teach me.
Come on, Sir Hilary.
We expect great things of you.
- We're leaving very soon. I must see you.
- Eight o'clock tonight.
And the man was alone?
- Ah! Good morning, ladies.
- Morning!
Good morning, Sir Hilary,
and how's your research?
Riveting. And very promising too.
I've never heard
anything so ridiculous.
Since when is climbing
a criminal offence?
- Excuse me. Piz Gloria's private property.
- The whole bloody Alp?! Ridiculous!
There are many signs,
and my servant warned you at the station.
Your throw, I think it is.
No, Frulein! I had my throw.
Made a mess of it, I'm afraid.
That didn't count. You can throw again.
- Yes! Go on!
- Very civil of you.
That doesn't entitle you to shoot at me.
- Who the hell are you, anyway?
- I am the director of this institute.
Oh!
You'll be sent down by cable car
and you will not trouble us again.
What about my clobber? My belongings?
- They'll be sent down later.
- But they're mine!
We have certain rules
which must be observed.
- The authorities'll hear about this.
- Good day, sir.
- Director, or Count, as I think I can say.
- Yes?
I'd like the afternoon off,
so if the cable car's going down...
But you've already had the morning off.
I must have some fresh air.
Your ancestors are very hard work.
And the College of Arms
is being very well paid.
- Well, if you put it like that...
- I do put it like that.
Let me show you what I've achieved,
then we can go to Augsburg.
Not over Christmas.
The archives will be closed, no?
Come, girls. Time for our massage.
Girls, that is
enough curling for today.
- I must see you tonight.
- Nine o'clock?
Ten?
Well, back to work.
You've no idea how it's piling up.
Ruby? It's me.
Hilly.
Hilly's so sad that Ruby's leaving.
Has that old cow told you...
Fancy meeting you here, Frulein!
Merry Christmas, 007.
- I'm Sir Hilary Bray.
- Oh, no, no, no, Mr Bond.
Respectable baronets from colleges
do not seduce female patients in clinics.
On the other hand, they do get
their professional details right.
The Bleuchamp tombs
are not in the Augsburg Cathedral,
but in the St Anna Kirche.
Sir Hilary Bray would have known.
A small slip.
Takes more than a few props
to turn 007 into a herald.
It'll take more than cutting off
your ear lobes to turn you into a count.
I may yet surprise you, but I'm afraid
that you have no surprises left for me.
I know all about your mission, Mr Bond.
Your colleague:
Such a keen climber, such a brilliant
conversationalist. Before he left us.
- He reported where I am.
- I doubt that.
In any case,
no one's coming to your rescue.
In a few hours, the United Nations
will receive our yuletide greetings.
The information that I now possess
the scientific means to control,
or to destroy, the economy
of the whole world.
People will have more important things
to think of than you.
If they believe your threat.
Oh, they will. In any case,
I have prepared a demonstration.
Remember that disagreeable outbreak
of foot-and-mouth disease
in England last summer?
I shall instruct them, in very convincing
terms, exactly how I arranged that.
And my capacity has improved since.
Allergy vaccines?
Bacteria.
- Bacteriological warfare.
- With a difference.
Our great breakthrough
since last summer
has been the confection
of a certain virus omega.
- Infertility.
- Total infertility. In plants and animals.
Not just disease in a few herds, Mr Bond,
or the loss of a single crop.
But the destruction of a whole strain
for ever, throughout an entire continent.
If my demands are not met,
I'll proceed with the extinction
of whole species of cereals
and livestock all over the world.
Including, I suppose, the human race.
I don't think, do you, Mr Bond,
the UN will let it come to that.
Not after their scientists analyse a sample
of virus omega they have received.
Epidemics of sterility.
Nothing is born.
No seed even begins to sprout.
- They'll find an antidote.
- Of course!
If I give them enough time.
They'll have time. Once they're warned,
you'll have problems dispensing the stuff.
That problem has already been solved.
I have been training
my own special "angels of death".
- Those girls?
- Those girls. And many others like them.
But exactly how?
That will remain my secret.
And how many millions do you
want for your services this time?
This time?
This time the price is different. You'll be
more amused when you know what.
Meanwhile, I will
keep you here as my guest.
You'll be useful in helping
to convince the authorities
that I mean what I say
and I'll do what I claim.
Come, let me show you
to your new quarters.
You're likely to be with us
for some time, Mr Bond.
So first,
a little therapy
to soothe your restless nature.
Oh,
poor fellow. He was restless, too.
You perverse British,
how you love your exercise.
Every year, dozens of amateur climbers,
they wind up in the same predicament.
A kind of waxwork show
for morbid tourists.
Dear, dear me.
Now, now, now, now, Mr Bond,
you must learn to be absolutely calm
before we can accept you back
into polite society.
Presents!
These are for us!
Going-away presents.
From the Count himself,
in appreciation.
- I want to open mine now!
- Oh, no!
It is more fun
to open them all together, yes?
Please sit down.
We will wait for the others.
Look, pressies!
Eggnog on Christmas Eve, just like home!
It is a treat for the going-away party.
- Your very good health, my dears.
- Cheers.
It has been so nice to cure you.
It has something special in it
for the holy night celebration.
... and now you're going
on a journey. A journey home.
But first you must rest for a while.
Rest.
I will tell you when.
And I will tell you how.
But it must be our secret.
Yours and mine. Our secret.
After you've done what I teach you,
will you forget it?
For ever.
And now you may open your eyes again.
Each of you has been given a present.
Such a prettily wrapped present.
Now is the time to open them. Open them.
You see?
They're beautiful and
you're longing to know what is inside.
You may use anything but the atomiser,
which you must never touch, never,
until I tell you how and where to use it.
Open the compact.
Adjust the volume control.
Every night
at exactly 12 o'clock you must be alone
so that you can switch on that receiver
and listen for my voice.
I'll tell you what to do,
I will tell you when
and I will tell you how.
After you've heard what I say, push the
mirror back to conceal the receiver again.
Push it back now.
Then close the case.
Now rest again. Rest.
In a few minutes you will wake up.
You will not remember
what I've just told you
until you return home.
Hilfe!
Ah! Argh!
Please, girls, we are in a hurry.
Merry Christmas!
Maybe you should have been
gift-wrapped.
Schnell! Der Englnder ist abgehauen!
Der Englnder ist verschwunden.
Flare.
- He's making for the village.
- Head him off at the precipice.
Idiot!
Argh!
Argh!
Goodbye, girls.
Merry Christmas and a happy New Year.
Frhliche Weihnachten.
- Auf wiedersehen!
- Auf wiedersehen!
Bye!
- Der Englnder ist ins Dorf geflchtet.
- Er ist ausgerckt?
Der Englnder. Quick!
Wir mssen ihn umzingeln.
Ooh!
Oh!
Goodbye.
So was von Idiot!
Come on.
They need sunshine and raindrops
Friendship and kindness
And most of all
They need love
Do you know how Santa gets around?
He needs snowflakes, snowflakes...
He needs reindeer
Reindeer, even though they try,
they need other things
Once a year they have to fly
And they don't have wings
Do you know how Santa gets around?
He needs snowflakes and reindeer
Sunshine and raindrops
Friendship and kindness
And most of all
He needs love
James!
- Darling, you're in trouble. What is it?
- There's people after me.
- Can I help?
- Have you got a car?
Outside.
Let's get out of here.
Stay close to me.
Not far now.
Nearside door.
Maybe he didn't see me.
- I wouldn't go banco on that.
- Giving up bad habits, eh?
- James, where are we heading?
- Nearest post office to contact London.
I know. Feldkirch.
- Why are they looking for you?
- I suspect they're trying to kill me.
Drive on!
- No sign of them yet.
- Or of someone saying thank you.
Thank you, Tracy.
You've got sharp eyes and beautiful
ear lobes. What were you doing
so near Piz Gloria?
Now I have a new interest in life.
- Winter sports? Very wholesome.
- Just one winter sportsman.
And Papa told me where to find him.
Just keep my mind on your driving!
Oh, there it is, James. Hurry.
James!
Shoot at them!
Good girl.
Turn left. A crowd may discourage them.
Stehen bleiben!
Looks like we've hit the rush hour.
Stop him!
How do we get out?
Knock him out of the way!
I hope my big end will stand up to this.
James! How do we get out?
- We can get out there.
- If you say so.
Bremsen Sie doch!
We didn't even stop for the prize!
I said a crowd
would discourage them.
Oh, that's all we need now!
Pull in there.
Keep moving. I'll open the doors.
Sorry about the accommodation,
Contessa.
We should have rung ahead and booked.
If only I'd got through to London.
- You'll get another chance.
- But when?
Let's get some rest.
We'll push on as soon as we can.
At least it's dry.
What really went on up there, James?
Mm-mm. Her Majesty's Secret Service
is still my job.
But there's nothing you can do
about your job at the moment, is there?
Then why are you thinking about it now?
I'm not.
I'm thinking about us.
Tracy, an agent shouldn't be concerned
with anything but himself.
I understand.
- We'll just have to go on the way we are.
- No.
I'll have to find something else to do.
Are you sure, James?
I love you.
I know I'll never find another girl like you.
Will you marry me?
D'you mean it?
I mean it.
Mr and Mrs James Bond.
Of Acacia Avenue, Tunbridge Wells.
Mm. How about Belgrave Square?
Or the Via Veneto, Rome?
Paris. Convenient for Le Touquet.
Monaco. Handy for the Rainiers.
I wonder how much
they're asking for this place.
The proper time for this
is our wedding night.
And that's my New Year's resolution.
- Whatever you say, darling.
- And that is yours.
Good night, Tracy.
Good night, James.
- Oh!
- It's not New Year yet!
- James!
- Keep going!
- Simple!
- Good girl!
Argh!
He had lots of guts!
You three, keep going.
Let's head for the trees!
- James!
- Keep going!
Tracy, cling on to me!
A grave deep enough, I think,
to prevent even 007 from walking.
Get the girl.
United Nations, sir.
Red scrambler.
M here.
Yes, we're standing by as instructed.
I understand.
Thank you, sir.
No decision has been announced yet.
Of course, there's a total news blackout,
but my informant was very plain.
- How plain, sir?
- They're going to buy Blofeld off.
Sit down.
- And the price?
- Amnesty.
A full pardon for all past crimes.
Official recognition of his title
when he retires into private life
as Count de Bleuchamp.
He seems to set a great store by that.
A very curious thing, snobbery.
When will they conclude the deal?
Blofeld wants a decision
by midnight the day after tomorrow.
Sir, that gives us time
to get to Piz Gloria first -in force.
No, 007. My instructions are clear.
Sir, destroy the institute
and Blofeld's virus with it.
It's been rejected as too risky.
Those girls.
God knows how many, let alone where.
Sir, if we destroy the centre of
communication that controls the girls,
the girls can do nothing.
I have my orders, 007.
You have yours. Forget it.
And the girl who helped me.
We just leave her?
This department is not concerned
with your personal problems.
This department owes her a debt.
- She saved my life.
- Operation Bedlam is dead.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.
I understand.
Your call to Marc Ange Draco,
Head of Draco Construction.
- Hello, Draco.
- Who is it?
- Bond. James Bond.
- Thank God, James.
I'd like to interest you in a deal requiring
certain aerial activity to install equipment.
Are you sure we're going to find Teresa
when we get up there?
I'm pretty certain.
There's a good reason for going anyway.
So you've explained. Quite a crusade.
It is a time for celebration.
Perhaps.
- If they agree.
- They can do nothing else. You know it.
And they know it.
I shall be able to offer you
anything your heart could wish for.
Paid for with how many lives?
Oh, come now, Tracy,
don't be so proud.
Your own father's profession
is not entirely within the law.
His brotherhood also have exotic ways
to keep it a close shot.
Basle Approach calling
unidentified aircraft over Basle.
You're flying in controlled airspace.
We have no flight plan filed on you.
I think some people
don't know we are crusaders.
Now, if you're very, very nice to me,
I could make you my countess.
But I'm already a countess.
Whereas if you displease me,
I can promise you a very different estate.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?
There is something on the radio
you should hear.
- Excuse me.
- This is Zrich Information
calling unidentified aircraft, over.
I repeat. This is Zrich Information
calling unidentified aircraft...
That helicopter is one of three.
None have answered air control.
- And?
- There are suspect aircraft in the vicinity.
Pilot's name and destination, over.
Zrich, this is Foxtrot Golf Sierra,
leading Red Cross helicopter flight.
Carrying Red Cross medical supplies
to Italy. What's the trouble? Over.
We have no record of your flight plan
or registration, over.
I repeat, we have no record
of your flight plan or registration, over.
Then your registrations
must be out of date, over.
Foxtrot Golf Sierra, this is Zrich
Information. Land at Zrich and report.
I say again,
land at Zrich and report, over.
Do you wish to commit murder?
I told you, this is a mercy flight
carrying blood plasma
and emergency equipment
for the victims
of the Italian flood disaster at Rovigo.
I repeat, mercy flight!
D'you understand me?
- Golf Sierra?
- Yes?
Zrich. Very well, you may proceed, out.
You see, it is nothing.
That's settled it.
In case one of us is delayed on the way
home, it's better to have a rendezvous.
Before we start getting sentimental,
I think we're being followed.
I've been thinking
about your proposition.
Please tell me more.
This is military air control.
There is no record of your mission.
Alter course to Zrich and land.
Fighters have been dispatched
to intercept you.
I suggest you check your records again.
Carefully. Over.
I repeat, return to Zrich and land, over.
Check with Geneva.
Check with the Red Cross in Geneva.
Meanwhile, call off your air force.
It is making my passengers sick.
Foxtrot Golf Sierra,
you are carrying passengers?
Of course I am.
Distinguished representatives
of the world press.
They've had enough
of your nonsense. So have I.
Over and out.
There's a lot more to tell,
but there'll be plenty of time later.
- Take me to the Alpine room.
- Oh?
Are you unhappy here?
Oh, I want to see the dawn.
Ah, so poetic a pleasure.
What were all the world's charms
to mighty Paris
when he found that first dawn
in the arms of his Helen?
And when do you expect the signal
accepting your terms?
Any time before midnight tonight.
"Thy dawn, O Master of the World,
thy dawn.
"For thee the sunlight
creeps across the lawn.
"For thee the ships
are drawn down to the waves.
"For thee the markets throng
with myriad slaves.
"For thee the hammer on the anvil rings.
"For thee
"the poet of beguilement sings."
- Helicopters!
- Get our positions covered!
Argh!
Look to the girl!
Ah...
Urgh!
- Tracy! Darling!
- Thank God, Teresa.
James, wait!
- Guns make me nervous.
- You've done your share.
Get her to safety!
Come on, let's go!
You,
get the circuits set up now. Let's go!
Argh!
- All points covered?
- Yes, sir.
- All set to blow?
- Fuse is set for exactly
five minutes, ten seconds.
The place will be sealed off for ever.
Will that give the Englishman
time to get out?
He knows the schedule.
- Where are you going?
- Where's James?
He'll join us soon.
- We can't leave him!
- He doesn't need you.
- I will not go without him!
- You'll have to.
Spare the rod and spoil the child, eh?
Five, four, three,
two, one.
Now!
Ah!
He's branched off!
Ah! Oh!
Never mind that!
Go and get the brandy, huh?
Five-star Hennessy, of course.
Your Royal Highnesses,
my lords, ladies and gentlemen,
the toast is the bride and bridegroom,
Mr and Mrs James Bond.
Mr and Mrs James Bond!
- Good luck, Teresa.
- Thank you.
Anyway, it is a pleasure
to meet the man who cost me
three of my best operators.
Yes. November '64-the bullion job.
You even got away with
quite a chunk of the haul.
Tell me, I've always...
Congratulations, 007. I must confess
I've sometimes thought you a little, erm...
- Irresponsible?
- Exactly! That's the word. Thank you!
- This time, my boy, I can't complain.
- Nor can I.
- Teresa.
- Yes, Papa?
Look, James, I know that
we haven't always exactly seen...
Well, don't forget,
if there's anything you need...
Thank you, but this time I have
the gadgets and I know how to use them.
Au revoir.
Remember, obey your husband
in all things. You promise me?
But of course I will.
As I always obeyed you.
Of course.
Well, James, I wish you luck.
For the first and last time, remember?
An old proverb.
"Her price is far above rubies",
or even your million pounds.
Teresa, just because you're Mrs Bond,
don't forget my birthday next year.
- Have I ever?
- Both of you, or maybe all of you!
Come on, James!
Very happy. Be happy, my darling.
Come on.
On your way.
- Au revoir.
- Goodbye!
Drive carefully.
Miss Moneypenny,
what would you do without me?
I always cry at weddings.
007 never had any respect
for government property.
I haven't given you a wedding present yet.
I had an idea about that.
Three girls, three boys.
- Pleased?
- Mm, not bad for a start.
But, darling,
now we have all the time in the world.
Say it with flowers!
He's got a point, we do
look like an ad for a flower shop!
And that reminds me,
I didn't even send you flowers.
Anyway, you have given me
a wedding present.
The best I could have.
A future.
Mrs Bond, shut...
...up!
And don't eat it all at once.
- He loves me.
- Instinctively.
- Infuriatingly.
- Intensely.
In...
- In...
- In? In?
- In.
- Indubitably.
First a boy, then a girl.
It's Blofeld!
It's Blofeld.
It's all right.
It's quite all right, really.
She's having a rest.
We'll be going on soon.
There's no hurry, you see?
We have all the time in the world.
Where is he?
I shan't ask you politely next time.
Where is Blofeld?
Cai... Cai...
Cairo!
Cards.
Hit me.
One chance.
Where can I find him?
Marie...
Ask Marie.
Who are you?
My name is Bond. James Bond.
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is.
There is something I'd like you
to get off your chest.
Where is Ernst Stavro Blofeld?
Speak up, darling. I can't hear you.
We now come to phase four: The nose.
In my opinion, the most difficult part
of a plastic transformation.
I want the operation done tonight.
- But, seor...
- There's no time left.
But, Seor Blofeld,
this is a most delicate procedure.
Tonight!
Keep the temperature
at precisely 80 degrees.
Making mud pies, 007?
He "would" have been me
in a matter of days
if you'd given the poor fellow a chance.
Such a pity. I was dying to see
how the operation turned out.
Get his gun.
Hold it! Get your hands up.
Kill him!
Welcome to hell, Blofeld.
Star of South Africa.
The Akbar Shah. 116 carats rough.
Are you paying attention, 007?
The Akbar Shah, 116 carats rough.
But surely, sir, there's no need
to bring in our section
on a relatively simple smuggling matter.
Sir Donald has convinced the PM
otherwise.
May I remind you, 007,
that Blofeld's dead.
Finished!
The least we can expect from you now
is a little plain, solid work.
Good morning, gentlemen.
- Sir Donald will see you now.
- Thank you.
Good morning, Sir Donald.
- This is Commander Bond.
- How do you do? Please sit down.
- Sherry?
- Not for me, thanks. Doctor's orders.
- Commander Bond?
- Yes, thank you.
You've been on holiday, I understand.
Relaxing, I hope.
Hardly relaxing but... most satisfying.
Cheers.
Pity about your liver, sir.
It's an unusually fine Solera.
- '51, I believe.
- There is no year for sherry, 007.
I was referring to the original vintage
on which the sherry is based, sir.
Unmistakable.
Precisely.
Tell me, Commander.
How far does your expertise extend
into the field of diamonds?
Hardest substance found in nature.
They cut glass. Suggest marriage.
They've replaced a dog
as a girl's best friend. That's about it.
Refreshing to hear there's "one" subject
you're not an expert on.
Perhaps I'd better give you
a brief background into our problem.
Eighty per cent of the world's diamonds
come from mines in South Africa.

is subject to an airtight security system.
It's a necessary precaution,
the loyalty and devotion of its workers.
Next!
The scorpion.
Mother nature's finest killer, Mr Wint.
One is never too old
to learn from a master, Mr Kidd.
Dr Tynan? Good evening.
Who are you? And where is Joe?
Joe couldn't make it tonight.
I'm Mr Wint.
This is Mr Kidd.
I see.
What's the matter with him?
It's my wisdom teeth.
I haven't had 'em out yet.
Would you mind having a look, Doctor?
Of course.
I'm not going to hurt you. Just open.
No, no. Open wide.
Curious
how everyone who touches
those diamonds seems to... die.
- Stop right there! Who are you?
- Dr Tynan sent us.
- Why didn't he come himself?
- He was taken sick.
Bitten by the bug.
He sent this for you.
If God had wanted man to fly...
He would have given him wings, Mr Kidd.
No security system is perfect.
We've always accepted
a percentage of smuggling.
But over the past two years, despite all
our precautions, it's gone up alarmingly.
And none of the stones
have reached the market.
Sir Donald thinks someone's stockpiling.
Our concern is that someone might dump
them on the market to depress prices or...
Make you agree to perpetual blackmail.
Exactly.
What we need to know is
who the stockpilers are.
The letter U
is for umbrella.
We take it lest it rain.
We hope we shan't want it
till we're home again.
Two men to see you, missy.
Gentlemen, Joshua.
I shan't be long, children.
Joshua is going to read you a story.
How nice to see you again!
- Where to this time?
- Amsterdam.
Amsterdam! Oh, how lovely!
I shall have to bring back some pictures
of the canals for the children.
Ask, and ye shall receive, Mrs Whistler.
Thus endeth the lesson
for today, gentlemen.
Several recent murders in South Africa
have complicated matters.
If they shut down operations
before we discover them...
It would be catastrophic for us
and for the government.
- I've always fancied a trip to South Africa.
- You're going to Holland.
For some time we've had our eyes
on a smuggler - Peter Franks.
He's due to leave for Amsterdam.
Do we know who his contacts are?
We do function
in your absence, Commander.
Passport, sir?
Mr Franks. There's a message
for you at Passport Control.
That door over there.
You can park outside.
Thank you.
Mr Franks...
Your passport is quite in order.
Anyone seeing you
in that outfit, Moneypenny,
would certainly be discouraged
from leaving the country.
What can I bring you back from Holland?
A diamond?
In a ring?
Would you settle for a tulip?
Yes.
Ahead is one of
the oldest bridges in Amsterdam.
The Skinny Bridge.
It was built over 300 years ago
by two sisters who wanted
to visit each other every day.
Unfortunately they ran out of money. So
that is why it is called the Skinny Bridge.
On your right,
those beautiful old houses
can be seen in the paintings
of our famous painter, Rembrandt.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
if you will look to your left
as we go down the Amstel, you can see...
Mrs Whistler did want some pictures
of the canals for the children.
How kind of you, Mr Kidd.
The children will be so thrilled.
Yes?
Franks. Peter Franks.
Come up. Third floor.
Make yourself at home!
I'll be out in a minute!
Help yourself to a drink!
Is Mr Case not at home?
There is no Mr Case. The T is for Tiffany.
Tiffany Case?
Definitely distinctive.
I was born there, on the first floor,
while my mother was
looking for a wedding ring.
I'm glad for your sake
it wasn't Van Cleef and Arpels.
Weren't you a blonde when I came in?
Could be.
I tend to notice little things like that.
Whether a girl is a blonde or a brunette.
And which do you prefer?
Providing the collars and cuffs match...
We'll talk about that later.
Let me have your glass.
I'll get you some ice.
That's quite a nice little nothing
you're almost wearing. I approve.
I don't dress for the hired help.
Let's see your passport, Franks.
Occupation: Transport consultant?
That's a little cute, isn't it?
- I'll finish dressing.
- Please don't. Not on my account.
I don't care much for redheads.
Terrible tempers.
But somehow it seems to suit you.
It's my own.
But it is in need of some soft lighting.
- I know a little restaurant...
- I never mix business with pleasure.
- Neither do I.
- Good!
Then save the cute remarks until after
you get the diamonds into Los Angeles.
- Where are they now?
- That's not your problem.
Your problem is getting them in.
- How much is there?
- 50,000 carats.
At 142 carats an ounce, that's
an awful lot of ice. That won't be easy.
That's why you're being paid 50 grand.
What did you think it was going to be?
A pair of earrings?
And, Franks, for God's sakes,
come up with something original.
I've got to hand it to you, Q.
Quite ingenious.
An obvious little notion.
Thought it might come in handy.
M's been trying to get in touch with you.
That Peter Franks fellow's escaped.
on the way up to London.
Hello?
Hello!
Are you there?
- Yes?
- Peter Franks.
Third floor.
- Guten Abend.
- Good evening.
Bitte.
- You are English?
- Yes, I'm English.
I speak English.
- Who is... your floor?
- Three, please.
Is he dead?
I sincerely hope so.
- Who is he?
- No idea.
This chap's been following me
all day today.
My God!
You've just killed James Bond!
Is that who it was?
It just proves no one's indestructible.
You don't kill James Bond and
wait around for the cops to arrive!
We've got to get those diamonds
out of here fast!
Where are they?
A little old lady dropped them by
yesterday morning.
Priceless.
I think we ought to let Mr Bond
carry the load from here on out.
It's funny.
All the things one wanted to say
to one's brother... when it's all too late.
Let me assure you
of our deepest condolences.
Would you please board the aircraft?
- We were inseparable, you know.
- Please, Mr Franks.
of flight LH450 to Los Angeles.
and no smoking until airborne.
Thank you.
They're both aboard. I must say,
Miss Case seems quite attractive.
For a lady.
of flight LH450 from Amsterdam...
- Mr Franks?
- Yes.
Follow me to Customs, please.
Peter Franks, Jerry.
Get some lunch, Jerry. I'll take over.
Death certificate, please, Mr Franks.
Well, well, well!
Felix Leiter, you old fraud.
On behalf of the CIA,
welcome to America.
Someone sent their brain trust
down to meet you.
I give up. I know
the diamonds are in the body,
but where?
Alimentary, Dr Leiter.
So long, James. Keep in touch.
The rest of your luggage
has been cleared, Mr Franks. OK, fellas!
You wanna sit in the front, Mr Franks?
It's a lot smoother ride
in the front, Mr Franks.
Yes, I believe I'll sit in front.
The stiff - "deceased" back there.
Your brother, Mr Franks?
Yes, it was.
I got a brudder.
Small world.
Mr Franks, I'm Morton Slumber.
Please accept my heartfelt condolences
at this most difficult hour.
He is heading
for a better world, Mr Slumber.
There is some consolation in that.
Now then, if we're ready
to begin the final journey...
May his soul rest in peace.
Oh, yes. Amen.
If you'd come into my comfortable office,
we will bring you the urn.
I'm so happy you chose our half-couch,
hinged-panel, slumber-on casket.
I'm sure your brother
would have appreciated it.
I'm sure he did.
Please, be seated.
Ashes to ashes...
- Dust to dust.
- Exactly.
At a moment like this, I'm sure
you'd rather be left alone, for reflection.
Most thoughtful.
We've selected a private niche for your
brother in our Garden of Remembrance.
The one with the restful chartreuse
curtains and Angel's Breath gold trim.
I hope you'll find everything in order.
The arrangements
have been impeccable
so far.
Very... moving.
Heart-warming, Mr Wint.
A glowing tribute, Mr Kidd.
You dirty, double-crossin' limey fink!
Those goddamn diamonds are phonies!
No, don't tell me. You're St Peter?
Paste! Glass!
Where's the real stuff, Franks?
Where's the real money? You wouldn't
burn 50,000 "real" dollars, would you?
One last break.
Where are the real diamonds?
You get me the real money
and I'll bring you the real diamonds.
Where do you think you're goin'?
I hear that the Hotel Tropicana
is quite comfortable.
My condolences, gentlemen.
Hello, Felix.
Very comfortable.
But there's one problem.
I want the real merchandise -
rather quickly.
We'll be up with them in the morning.
There's no sense in looking for trouble.
I'm sure you know how.
Quite. I'll probably take in a show.
How do you like me so far?
People say I have
the body of Rock Hudson.
If he ever finds out what I'm doin' to it,
he'll be madder than hell.
I call these girls my Acorns.
Actually, they're a gift from Willard Whyte,
who is upstairs right now
playing Monopoly with real buildings.
Tryin' to find Willard Whyte is like
tryin' to find a virgin in a maternity ward.
On behalf of the Whyte House,
I wanna let you folks know
you've been a lousy audience.
So get lost. See ya later.
Shady Tree!
- Shady, we just adored your act!
- What taste, style!
And we have a few suggestions.
Critics and material I don't need!
I haven't changed my act in 40 years.
Hold it! Don't go in there.
We didn't get the real diamonds,
so we need Tree - alive.
That's most annoying.
- Get down there!
- Crap. Boxcar, the loser.
That's it, pussycat.
I shot the whole wad.
What do you say? Back to my place?
You're a nice person, Maxie.
Really, you are.
Why don't you go and take a nap?
And I'll see you next year.
May I have $5,000? No, make it $10,000.
$2,000 limit.
Is there some problem?
Mr Saxby.
Gentleman wants $10,000 credit
with a $2,000 limit.
My name is Franks.
Peter Franks.
Mr Franks' credit's good.
- Good luck to you, Mr Franks.
- Thank you. I'll have two stacks now.
Give the gentleman 4,000.
Thank you.
Hi! I'm Plenty.
- But of course you are.
- Plenty O'Toole.
Named after your father, perhaps?
Would you like some help?
On the craps, I mean.
That's very kind of you.
Coming out. Coming out.
Next shooter is a lady.
Ladies are lucky. For the lady.
Nine. Mark nine.
Seven, loser. The lucky lady craps out.
New shooter. Your shot, Mr F.
- Willard Whyte speakin'.
- Tree is dead. Turn on number two.
It's Peter Franks.
Hard ten. Ten's the number.
I'll take the full odds on the ten.
200 on the hard way.
The limit on all the numbers,
250 on the eleven. Thank you very much.
Say! You've played this game before!
Just once.
- Now what do we do?
- Don't bother me with details, Bert!
Just get me the diamonds!
You handle those cubes
like a monkey handles coconuts.
Thank you, gentlemen,
for such a sterling service.
That's 50,000 dollars!
Minus $5,000 for you... leaves me
$45,000, and thank you very much.
It was nothing, really!
You know something, Peter Franks?
You're a terrific guy!
A little weird, but a terrific guy!
Why don't we go someplace
and have a drink?
A drink?
If you'd like to come in, Plenty.
How pretty!
What a super place you have!
Just give me one second, lover.
Good evening.
I'm afraid you've caught me
with more than my hands up.
What the hell is this?!
A perverts' convention or something?!
You can't do this to me!
Stop that! I've got friends in this town!
Exceptionally fine shot.
I didn't know there was
a pool down there.
Let's get down to business.
I presume you've come for the real...
The real diamonds.
Good evening, Miss Case.
Sorry about your fulsome friend.
I'll bet you really missed something.
The evening may not be
a total loss after all.
Why don't we talk a bit first?
First?
What would you like to talk about?
You pick a subject.
- Diamonds?
- Good boy!
And you want to know where they are,
and whether I'm working alone or not.
So far, so good. Keep going.
And if not, then with whom.
So you can inform your superiors and...
acquire the diamonds.
Peter!
I'm very impressed.
There's a lot more to you
than I had expected.
Presumably I'm the condemned man,
and obviously you're the hearty breakfast.
Right?
You're not going to tell me
where the diamonds are, are you?
What diamonds?
Sooner or later you'll have to talk.
They'll make you.
At the very least, you'll never
get out of town alive.
I can solve that little problem.
It's lucky for me that I ran into you.
Fifty-fifty split.
You get the diamonds, I get us out.
Us?
I can't very well help you
and then stick around.
We could be on a plane and
out of the country by tomorrow night.
Rio... Hong Kong...
I know a good tailor in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong.
All right. I'll get the diamonds,
you get the plane tickets.
No. The airport's too obvious.
A rented car should
do us fine for openers.
That's good thinking.
And since you're the one being watched,
I'll get the diamonds, you get the car.
That's very good thinking.
Oh, Peter!
I have a feeling this is the beginning
of a wonderful relationship.
Darling...
Where do I pick up the diamonds?
When was the last time
you visited a circus?
Circus Circus proudly presents
the Flying Palacios!
- She's in the building.
- Right. Stand by.
James, next time, pick a contact point
when you're standing up.
- Felix, if she gives your men the slip...
- Relax. I have 30 agents down there.
A mouse with sneakers on

Operation Passover, commence.
Roger.
She's on her way. So far, so good.
- Good luck, Felix. I'll see you later.
- Where are you going?
The car rental agency.
Our little rendezvous?
You don't actually think she'll show up?
That's a thousand-to-one shot.
No, more like even money.
Her devotion to larceny
versus my... incomparable charm.
All right, kiddies!
Ready? Aim! Fire!
What did I tell you?
Didn't I promise you a winner every time?
There you are, young man.
Boys and girls, here we go again.
All you have to do is just take your gun...
Here we have a little lady,
here we have a little man,
and here we have a big lady.
You're a little out of your league,
aren't ya, sister?
Point the gun. You know what to do.
All ready? Get set.
Now hold it till I say go.
Go!
Come on! That's it!
Everybody point right at the clown.
A winner every time!
There we are! All right!
That's the way to do it!
Look at that!
And we have another winner!
Annie Oakley on the end!
Here we are. What an eye! What an eye!
Wait a second!
I saw the whole thing!
The machine's fixed!
Who's she - your mother?
Blow up your pants!
One win! She only had one win!
You're supposed to have 24
to win that dog!
Will you give it a rest, kid?
All right, boys and girls! Here we go!

We must have absolute silence

We must warn you that

there's always a danger.
So keep in mind those curtains is an exit.
God forbid something should go wrong

Now we start the transformation.
Very dangerous. Very quiet, please.
Wake, my beauty, wake!
Hey, lady, not through there.
The other way.
Come on!
- No show?
- Felix, don't tell me you lost her?
We lost her.
Nice place you have here.
Take something off. Enjoy the sun.
You've got a lot of guts showing up here!
Letting me freeze my behind off
at a blackjack table for two hours
waiting for some nonexistent diamonds!
And what the hell
is my black wig doing in the pool?!
- She's...
- Dead.
Supposed to be you.
The next link in the pipeline.
What are you talking about?
Poor Plenty must have

I don't believe you.
A dentist is dead in South Africa.
That little old lady in Amsterdam.
Shady got his last night.
They've missed me once.
And you're next.
- Now, who's your connection?
- You sound like a cop...
- Who's your connection?
- All I know is voices on a phone.
They got me this place and told me
to wait for further instructions.
You'd find it difficult to hear under water.
- Now, where's the stuff?
- Who are you?
You're not a cop
and you're not Peter Franks.
You're not the type to turn
the other cheek. Where is it?

Thank you.
Fill it up, please.
It's Bert Saxby.
Willard Whyte's right-hand man.
Do you see the top? The penthouse?
They say Willard Whyte hasn't
set foot out of there in three years.
And no one has seen him - no one.
- How much is that?
- Did you pay for this?
Cut him off.
Hey, Curly! What about my stamps?
Where are you going?
Are you mad? Let me by!
Stamps? You ain't got no gas yet!
- OK, so shove a coupla gallons in!
- Well, back it up.
Keep leaning on that tooter, Charlie,
and you'll get a shot in the mouth!
Come on, lady, move it!
OK, lady, you win, you win.
- Will someone move that car?!
- Do what he says!
Hey! I wanted high-test!
Forget it, Curly!
You had your chance and you blew it!
OK, Professor.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- I haven't seen you here before.
- I'm Klaus Hergersheimer.
- New here?
- I've been here three years. G Section.
How are things in G Section?
Still the same old grind. You know.
Checking radiation shields
for replacement.
By the way, where's yours?
I've been waiting a couple of days
for you guys to deliver them.
Gee, I'm sorry. You should have
given us a phone call.
Look, I've got one here.
Lucky for you, I carry spares.
You keep that on. You can't be
too careful about radiation.
Absolutely. I feel much safer with this on.
See you around.
Who are you? What do you want?
Klaus Hergersheimer. G Section.
Just... checking on radiation shields.
Now let me see. You are...?
Professor Dr Metz. Our shields are fine!
Now get out!
I'm sorry. It won't take a moment but
I must verify.
Metz. How do you spell it?
M-E... Will you please leave,
you irritating man?
Doctor, there's no reason
to run down the little people.
G Section may not be as important
to the operation as you are,
but we do have our orders.
Dr Metz... Willard Whyte for you.
Right. Out, out.
Hello, WW.
Yes, it's finally here.
Quite enough for completion.
We'll be through shortly.
No. No problems at all.
Right.
- Now will you get out of here?!
- Certainly, Doctor.
I've seen everything I need to see.
Thank you very much.
Hi. Sorry to bother you.
I'm Klaus Hergersheimer.
G Section.
Checking radiation shields?
There he is! Behind the rock! Come on!
What is this? Amateur night?
Stop him, Harry!
Get him off that machine. That isn't a toy.
Get out of that moon buggy!
It's gone berserk!
Hey, what do you think you're doin'?!
That way!
- What happened? The diamonds...
- Get in the car!
If you see a mad professor
in a minibus, just smile!
Fred, get the sheriff's office.
Drop me off at the next corner.
This is getting out of hand.
When you start stealing moon machines
from Willard Whyte,
goodbye and good luck!
Just relax. I have a friend named Felix
who can fix anything.
Is he married?
There goes that
son-of-a-bitchin' saboteur!
Relax! You've got a friend
named Felix who can fix anything.
Unfortunately, so can Willard Whyte.
Why, you dirty...
Come in, Larry. Larry?
Larry?
Did you get him, Larry?
I think Larry got him.
- Sheriff...
- Attaboy, Larry.
Come in. Larry?
Sheriff...
I got you now.
Lean over.
Darling...
Why are we suddenly staying
in the bridal suite of the Whyte House?
In order to form
a more perfect union, sweetheart.
James...
May I finally call you James?
What's going to happen to me?
You did talk to
your friend Felix about me?
What did he say?
Something about 20 years to life.
Nothing important.
- 20 years to life?!
- Relax, darling.
I'm on top of the situation.
Mr and Mrs Jones?
Yes, that's the name
on the register, Mr Leiter.
- What's the score with WW?
- Washington says no go.
- We sit still for now.
- Sit still?
And Miss Tiffany Case "Jones" has
a lifetime reservation at another hotel.
The kind the government... runs.
I'm cooperating, Mr Leiter.
Really I am.
I can vouch for that.
Felix, this is not the real White House,
and he's not the president.
- Why don't we go and see him?
- The president I can get you in to see.
But until Washington believes
Whyte's a thief, that's the way it is.
In the meantime, I'm sure
you and "Mrs Jones"
can find some way to amuse yourselves.
And just to make sure you're not
disturbed, I have a man upstairs.
And Hamilton... is right out here.
So long, James.
- Well, that's a switch!
- What's that?
The wolf being guarded
by the three little pigs.
I won't be long, darling.
Where are you going?
I'm just popping upstairs for a moment.
- Sixteenth floor?
- No, lady. Starlight Lounge only.
OK, folks. Stand clear
of the doors. Here we go.
Starlight Lounge to the left.
Express to street level only, folks.
OK. Stand clear of the doors. Here we go.
Howdy, son. We've been expectin' you.
to take care of in there,
you go right ahead.
First, I suspect you're wearin' a hog leg.
and takin' it off?
Isn't that nice?
You are a pleasant fella.
Why don't you just come on in, son?
Relax. Make yourself comfortable.
That's good. Right on over there.
Good evening, Mr Bond.
Blofeld.
Good evening, 007.
Double jeopardy, Mr Bond.
You killed my only other double,
I'm afraid.
After his death, volunteers were
- understandably - rather scarce.
Such a pity. All that time and expense
simply to provide you
with one mock-heroic moment.
Willard Whyte speakin'.
Yes, Governor. I got your message.
No, I'm afraid a personal appearance
is quite out of the question.
I'll send a deposition to the committee.
Thank you, Governor.
Well, that's a neat trick.
A voice box, Mr Bond.
Science was never my strong suit,
but the principle is easy enough.
Someone's voice patterns and resonance
stored in a small oral-signature tape.
And a miniature, transistorised version
is installed in his neck.
Or is it "his" neck? I never can remember.
Anyway, no matter. We both sound alike.
My congratulations to you both.
Nice little company.
Explosives, oil, electronics,
houses, aviation.
I've done rather well with it, too.
Tried to cut some of the fat off,
but Mr Whyte's a splendid administrator.
Damn thing runs itself.
I suppose you killed "him".
Nothing so melodramatic.
I'm simply holding him
in cold storage, so to speak.
An insurance policy against any
outside interference with my plans.
The ideal kidnap victim.
No one's seen the man for five years.
Who'd miss someone
who's already missing?
How clever you are, Mr Bond.
Nice to see you haven't lost
that fine mental edge, 007.
Please don't get any foolish notions.
That missile is not a practical weapon.
Well, it's hardly worth the effort.
After all, I wouldn't know
which one of you to kill.
We appreciate
your predicament, Mr Bond.
We deeply sympathise.
Right idea, Mr Bond.
But wrong pussy.
I do so enjoy our little visits, Mr Bond.
However potentially painful they may be.
But I'm afraid this one
has come to an end.
What do you intend to do
with those diamonds?
An excellent question.
And one which will be hanging
on the lips of the world quite soon.
If I were to break the news to anyone,
it would be to you first. You know that.
But it's late, I'm tired,
and there's so much left to do.
Good night, Mr Bond.
Well, go on, go on. It's merely a lift.
Or perhaps I should say "elevator".
In any event, I'm sure
you'll find it much more convenient
than mountaineering about
outside the Whyte House.
You press L, Mr Bond.
The word "lobby" begins with L.
If at first you don't succeed, Mr Kidd...
Try, try again, Mr Wint.
One of us smells like
a tart's handkerchief.
I'm afraid it's me.
Sorry about that, old boy.
I don't mind the cockamamie machine
breaking down twice a day.
But why the hell does it always have to be
500 yards away from the nearest hatch?
All right, Charlie.
It's your turn to play hunchback.
Thank you very much.
I was just out walking my rat
and I seem to have lost my way.
Willard Whyte speakin'.
This is Bert.
We got a problem.
Got a cold?
Never mind about that.
I just saw James Bond in the casino.
- Come and see for yourself.
Hey, listen.
If he's half the genius they say he is,
we're in for real trouble.
- Calm down, Bert.
- It's a cinch he's not working alone.
This place must be
crawling with agents by now.
- Nonsense.
at his own summerhouse.
It's on the ridge,
about ten miles out of town.
It's not like you to panic.
I just don't enjoy messing around
with a guy as tough as James Bond.
Never mind James Bond.
You get down to that house.
I'm afraid Mr Whyte has suddenly
outgrown his usefulness.
- Do it cleanly, Bert.
- Don't worry.
Just leave everything to me.
That ridiculous contraption
actually seems to work, Q.
You've surpassed yourself this time.
Not a bit of it. Made one of these
for the kids last Christmas.
Maxwell, James and I
will head for the house.
Get set to hit the penthouse
as soon as we find Whyte.
Let me speak to Metz.
There's been a change.
Push all plans forward by 24 hours.
I'm joining you immediately.
Give me five minutes to get up there
and five minutes to find Whyte.
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?
Ask me again in ten minutes' time.
Tell Maxwell to stand by
to hit the penthouse.
Well, hi there!
I'm Bambi.
Good morning... Bambi.
And I'm Thumper.
Is there something we can do for you?
I can think of several things offhand but
at the moment
I'm looking for Willard Whyte.
Oh, Willie.
Why, he's right out there.
And that's all there is to it?
Not quite.
First... we're gonna have a ball.
All yours, Bambi!
You're on again, Bambi!
Thumper...
Hello, Felix.
Willard Whyte is about to be executed,
and guess who's giving
breaststroke lessons.
- Where the hell is Whyte?
- I haven't found out yet.
Still haven't found out.
Right!
FBI?
- CIA?
- No.
British Intelligence, Mr Whyte.
James Bond.
I see you've met my friends,
Bambi and Thumper.
Yes, we did have a bit of a chat.
What the hell's happened to me
and what can I do about it?
Let's get out of here first
and I'll explain it to you en route.
Tell Maxwell to hit the penthouse...
Saxby.
- Bert Saxby?!
- Yeah.
Tell him he's fired.
Hi there, Mr Q. Are you having any luck?
I'm being somewhat successful,
thank you.
Listen, Mr Q. I... I was wondering.
Have you heard any talk about me
from Felix or James?
No, I'm afraid not.
I guess I'm working
for the good guys now,
but I'm two steps away from
the slammer if they want me there.
I thought... you might be able
to put in a good word.
That's unbelievable!
An electromagnetic RPM controller.
Been aching to give it a try. You see,
pressure on the case when
the desired symbols appear
causes the rotation of the cylinders to
stutter at the precise moment needed to...
Cab, lady?
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.
I'm delighted to meet you, Miss Case.
I'd so dreaded the prospect of
making this tedious journey alone.
This way, Mr Whyte.
It was right here.
About six feet high, with a solar panel.
- It had these aerofoils that seemed to...
- Draw it for me.
Was Dr Metz on your payroll, Mr Whyte?
No. But I heard of him.
Everybody in our business has.
The world's leading expert
on laser refraction.
A committed idealist to peace.
And how in the hell Blofeld got
his hooks in him, I will never know!
How did he get security clearance
to work here in the first place?
From you, sir. I talked
to you personally about it.
I even recognised your voice just now.
I'm sure I must've told you
not to keep the usual duplicate
microfilm records of the project.
Exactly, sir.
Tom, what did "I" tell you to do with this?
Send it to Vandenberg, sir.
Well, get 'em on the phone - now!
Yeah?
You won't believe this.
- Willard Whyte for you!
- Wow.
- This is a real honour, sir.
- Shove your honour!
- Where's that satellite I sent down there?
- Blasted off 24 minutes ago, sir.
Perfect trajectory. All systems go.
We expect to enter orbit right on the nose.
- Wait. Something's happened.
- Just a moment.
The scanners have gone crazy.
- Premature first-stage separation!
- It doesn't make sense!
Stand by to abort!
We can't control it, sir.
Abort it!
It's negative.
We can't. Something's taken over
the guidance system!
It's as if it had a will of its own.
And there's not a damn thing
we can do about it.
We're working on it.
I'll call you back, Mr Whyte.
Whatever it is,
your friend Blofeld's controllin' it now.
A vast supply of diamonds manipulated
by an expert in light refraction.
The first laser beam
was generated through a diamond.
And if old Metz deserves his reputation,
the power of that thing
could be incredible.
And Blofeld's got it.
- Approaching North Dakota.
Alert Strategic Air Command.
Gimme an open line to SAC.
Attention all personnel.
for emergency procedure.
Willard Whyte.
Yes, General.
One of our missiles just "accidentally"
blew up in North Dakota.
Whatever's happenin',
Mr Bond, has started.
- Is this your herd?
- Mr Whyte, phone call from Washington.
- Urgent.
- I'll catch it in the john.
- What about Blofeld?
- Not a trace.
We found a tunnel. We'll check it out.
- Where's Tiffany?
- Do you "mind" if we find Blofeld first?
Come on! Let's hit that tunnel!
Washington just got word
from your friend with the cat.
Would you believe that this whole
damn country is bein' held for ransom
and we've got
till noon tomorrow to pay up?
So that's it. Well, I'm sure
you won't be alone.
An international auction,
with nuclear supremacy
goin' to the highest bidder.
Tell me, what does he need
to control that satellite?
A simple set of tapes
fed into a computer bank.
All he really needs is a building.
And these tapes? Large or small?
Conceivably any size.
From six inches to a cassette.
Assuming he's still using
your empire as a cover,
Blofeld could be anywhere on this map.
From Alaska to Florida.
From Maine to Oregon.
From Texas to... Baja California.
Baja?!
I haven't got anything in Baja!
There is still no official explanation
in North Dakota and Russia.
refused comment on a report
the Joint Chiefs of Staff is in session.
the Soviet Union have assured each other
has been taken by either nation.
in Red China are as yet unconfirmed.
Two more submarines have taken up
position not ten miles away.
Are those military aircraft
going to stand off forever?
What if they won't accept our ultimatum?
What if they attack?
Calm yourself, Metz. This farcical
show of force was only to be expected.
The Great Powers
flexing their military muscles
like so many impotent beach boys.
I deeply regret my threat to destroy
a major city unless they give in,
but the nuclear powers, like all bullies,
can only be intimidated by force.
- But how can you...
- They still have an hour left to reply.
One hour for both of us to achieve
our common dream: Total disarmament
and peace for the world.
- Sir, there's a single plane approaching.
- Range?
Two miles, and closing.
Stage One alert, please.
Command Centre.
All crew to Stage One.
Up the top! Second platform!
There he is!
- Aim!
- Hold your fire!
proceed to docking level and stand by.
Good morning, gentlemen!
The Acme Pollution Inspection.
We're cleaning up the world. We thought
this was a suitable starting point.
How disappointing! I expected
one head of state, at the very least.
Surely you haven't come
to negotiate, Mr Bond?
Your pitiful little island
hasn't even been threatened.
Search him from his toenails to the last
follicle on his head. Then bring him to me.
I do so hate martial music.
As usual, Mr Bond,
you were absolutely right.
You guessed correctly that that box
contained the satellite control tape
and you came aboard presumably
hoping to substitute this
for the real thing.
So sorry to have ruined
the line of your suit for nothing.
Talking about lines,
which one did you use on Miss Case?
She has taken a reasonable attitude.
Like any sensible animal,
she's only threatening when threatened.
Well, it appears that
you're holding all the aces.
- Right down to the dragon lady here.
- Jealousy? From you, Mr Bond?
I'm flattered.
As La Rochefoucauld observed:
"Humility is the worst form of conceit."
I do hold the winning hand.
Why don't you let me take you
on a little tour of our facilities?
Your chance to see
the real tape once again.
Can I tag along, Ernst?
I'd put something on
over that bikini first, my dear.
I've come too far
to have the aim of my crew
affected by the sight of a pretty body.
No word yet from anyone!
Only 12 minutes left.
I suppose a little gentle prodding
is called for.
As you see, Mr Bond,
the satellite is at present over
Kansas.
If we destroy Kansas, the world
may not hear about it for years.
Perhaps New York.
All that smut and traffic.
It would give them a chance
for a fresh start.
Washington, DC. Perfect.
Since we have not heard from "them",
"they" will hear from "us".
- See to it, Metz.
- Washington. Right.
And this, presumably,
is the control bank with the coded tape.
Right again, Mr Bond.
All satellites are controlled
by a coded tape.
The trick is, of course, to have the code.
Obviously.
It all seems so perfectly simple. I suppose
one just presses that and out it pops.
Put it back, Mr Bond.
Immediately.
Hi, Ernst.
Is Superman giving you any trouble?
Put it back... very carefully.
You've suddenly
become tiresome, Mr Bond.
Target fixed! Commence countdown!
Ten minutes and counting!
Take him away and throw him in the brig.
And search him again, just to make sure.
Bitch!
Come on!
Your problems are all behind you now.
Stop him!
Nine minutes and counting.
I did it. I switched the tape in the machine.
You stupid twit. You put
the real one back in.
Come on, let's go!
A weather balloon!
- What do you think, Mr Leiter?
- That must be the signal.
There isn't a low-pressure area
within 200 miles of here. Let's go!
This is Charlie One to Squadron.
Ready all guns and proceed to target.
I repeat: Proceed to target.
Roger, Charlie One. Out.
Come on, Bond. Get the hell off that rig.
Eight minutes and counting.
Unidentified aircraft approaching rapidly.
Range... five miles.
But I... I don't understand!
- You said they wouldn't attack!
- The balloon was a signal.
The stupid fools must think
Mr Bond has accomplished his mission.
- Activate defences!
- Activate defences.
Seven minutes and counting.
This is Charlie One.
Commence attack!
Commence attack!
Six minutes and counting.
Get them on the radio, Blofeld!
- Tell them we give up!
- Give up?
I've waited too long for this moment.
They'll pay dearly
for making a fool out of me.
I see it all now.
You don't give a damn about peace!
- All you care about...
- Shut up, Metz.
Tiffany, my dear.
We're showing a bit more "cheek"
than usual, aren't we?
Take her below and
lock her up with Mr Bond.
What a pity. Such nice cheeks, too.
If only they were brains.
Destroy this, Metz.
Five minutes and counting.
Four minutes and counting.
Tell them we surrender!
This is utter madness!
One more word, Metz, and I'll
have you shot! Get back to your post!
Prepare my bathosub immediately.
Three minutes and counting.
All systems interlock.
Bathosub to crane. Commence lift.
Two minutes and counting.
Power and breathing systems on.
Release catch is open.
Lower away.
Bathosub to crane! Lower away!
Wake up, man! Lower away!
You stupid idiot! You could've killed me!
Disengage!
Disengage!
Disengage!
Lower! Not up!
One minute and counting.
Blofeld to Command Centre!
Come in!
Blofeld to Command Centre!
Come in!
Damn you!
Command Centre, come in!
Get the gun.
- Here!
- Shoot 'em!
Jump!
Ten... nine...
So long, James! I'll wire M
you're on your way home!
Don't tell him
which direction we've taken!
If you're havin' a good time,
let the captain know and
I'll have him steam around in circles!
James, there's something very important
I've been meaning to ask you
about us.
I know in a relationship like ours, the
girl's not supposed to be the one to ask.
But I can't help it.
And please
think before answering.
That I promise.
James...
There must be some mistake.
I didn't order anything.
No mistake, sir.
On the specific instructions and with
the compliments of Mr Willard Whyte.
Oysters Andaluz.
Shashlik.
Tidbits.
Prime rib "en jus".
Salade Utopia.
And for dessert,
the "pice de rsistance"...
la bombe surprise.
That looks fantastic! What's in it?
But then there would be
no "surprise", would there, madame?
- If madam would care to be seated.
- Thank you.
This will just take a moment,
and then we will leave you in peace.
Wine, sir?
Mouton Rothschild '55.
- May we begin?
- Please do.
A happy selection, if I may say.
I'll be the judge of that.
That's rather potent.
Not the cork - your aftershave.
Strong enough to bury anything.
But the wine is quite excellent.
Although, for such a grand meal,
I had rather expected a claret.
Of course.
Unfortunately, our cellar
is rather poorly stocked with clarets.
Mouton Rothschild "is" a claret.
And I've smelt that aftershave before.
And both times I've smelt a rat.
He certainly left
with his tails between his legs.
Oh, James!
Oh, yes. What were you about to ask me?
James...
How the hell do we get
those diamonds down again?
..was so ably pointed out
by the Secretary-General
in his opening remarks.
But - and I must emphasise this point -
no formula can, or will,
ever cover each case.
For instance...
..when three or more applicants
have been recognised,
which is in direct contradiction to...
Whose funeral is it?
Yours.
One more time again.
Not married, by any chance, are you?
Good morning, 007.
Good... good morning.
Insomnia, sir?
Instructions.
You haven't much time.
I'll explain as you pack.
Pack, sir?
Three agents have been killed
in the last 24 hours.
Dawes in New York, Hamilton in
New Orleans and Baines in the Caribbean.
Baines. I rather liked Baines.
We shared the same boot maker.
Coffee,
sir?
I take it these killings are connected?
That's precisely
what you're going to find out.
Baines was working on a small
Caribbean island called San Monique.
Dawes was in New York,
keeping an eye on its prime minister,
one Dr Kananga.
Hamilton was on loan to the Americans
in New Orleans.
Is that all it does?
By the way, congratulations.
The ltalians were most impressed
by the way you handled the Rome affair.
Thank you, sir.
Sugar?
Thanks.
The authorities
were more than helpful.
There's one small complaint.
They seem to be missing
one of their agents.
A Miss... Caruso.
You wouldn't happen to know
where she is?
Miss Moneypenny.
- Morning, Moneypenny.
- Good morning, sir.
- It's only the hour that's indecent.
- Really?
I've got your ticket to New York.
Q has repaired your wristwatch.
- And some background on San Monique.
- Thank you, Moneypenny.
I'm sure the overburdened British
taxpayer will be fascinated to know
will how the Special Ordnance Section
disburses its funds.
In future, Commander, may I suggest
a perfectly adequate watchmaker
just down the street.
Good God!
Pulling out this button turns the watch
into a hyper-intensified magnetic field,
powerful enough to deflect
the path of a bullet
- at long range - or so Q claims.
- I feel tempted to test that theory now.
If you don't mind, Commander, my spoon.
Sorry, sir.
Thank you.
Dr Kananga is at present in New York.
The CIA have been informed.
They are helping with surveillance.
Your flight arrives at 1 1 .30am.
Now, where did I leave my coat?
Allow me.
Thank you.
Come along, Miss Moneypenny.
- Morning, Bond.
- Sir.
Miss Moneypenny.
Thank you.
Goodbye, James.
Or should I say... ciao, bello?
Such a delicate touch.
Sheer magnetism, darling.
A man comes.
He travels quickly.
He has purpose.
He comes over water.
He travels with others.
He will oppose.
He brings violence and destruction.
Hello.
- Mr Leiter for you, sir.
- Thank you.
Hello, Felix. How are you?
Traffic permitting,
I should be with you in halfan hour.
Then you can buy me
the best lunch in New York.
Hi, James. Your friend Kananga
has just left the UN.
He's probably headed back
to his embassy.
No, don't worry. The place is eyeballed,
wired for sound - the works.
Right. I'll see you in a half-hour.
Easy, Charlie.
Let's get there in one piece.
Charlie?
Right, stand by.
Here comes Kananga's limousine.
Out he gets
with the usual goon squad
and the girl.
Time: 1 1 .46.
What is that?!
Felix? You know I hate to trouble you,
but I've run into a little bother.
You what?!
Get me a make on a white pimpmobile.
3-4-7. Nelson David George.
It would seem, Dr Kananga,
that the conference has not
Iived up to your expectations.
We can only hope that
this is a temporary setback.
However, I do have
some observations to make.
Take a letter, please.
To Secretary-General,
Pan-lsland Unity Conference.
Sir...
I wish to point out...
that...
too many
of our island neighbours
have once again let themselves be...
bullied by United States industry.
The story is an old one,
the record a clear one.
Since my historic statement ofprinciples
was delivered and acted upon
some six months ago,
our economic outlook
has improved dramatically.
By exercising our policy of friendship
to all with favouritism towards none,
new respect for the entire area
has been injected.
And even though some ofmy...
James? That car is registered
to a shop at 33 East 65th Street.
That's only a block away from here.
Right. Take your time, buddy.
Kananga's knitting a flag in there.
It might be the easiest thing to do.
Something... in heads?
Just browsing, thank you.
Five dollars.
Do you think you could
giftwrap it for me, please?
Lengthwise, if you don't mind.
Thank you.
..remains my first concern.
Thus San Monique's obligations to
her island neighbours would seem clear.
Those who fawn and crawl
in the face ofintimidation
must perforce look up
to those who stand, proudly,
wrapped in ajustifiable self-confidence.
The time has come,
painful as it may be,
to gaze out among our sister nations
in the area and see ifany stands...
He's tailing.
I got him in my sights.
- You know where you're goin', man?
- Uptown, I believe.
Uptown? We headin' into Harlem, man.
Just keep on the tail of that jukebox
and there's an extra $20 for you.
Man, for 20 bucks,
I'd take you to a Ku Klux Klan cookout.
1 25th. You got a honky on your tail.
He's heading east.
Can't miss him.
It's like following a cue ball.
That's the car.
They must have gone inside.
Pull up where you can.
Sure hope you make friends easy.
Right on, brother.
He's headin' on in!
Good afternoon.
- Bourbon and water, please.
- The first booth will do.
Tell him neat, would you?
- No ice.
- That's extra, man.
I'd like something on the side as well.
Information.
Three men and a girl came in...
Relax, baby.
Mr Big's gonna take care of you
in a minute.
Black queen on the red king, Miss...?
Solitaire.
My name's Bond.
James Bond.
I know who you are,
what you are, and why you've come.
You've made a mistake.
You will not succeed.
Rather a sweeping statement,
considering we've never met.
The cards have followed you for me.
You get ripped off in Detroit,
you yell out to me! D'you hear?
Is he armed?
You can't be too careful in New York City.
Funny how the least little thing
amuses him.
Fascinating.
That's you, quite obviously.
An amazing resemblance.
Am I in there as well?
Pick a card.
Turn it over.
You have found yourself.
I'm telling you,
go out to LA and clean it up
or I'm coming out there
and clean you up. And I mean that!
Is this the stupid mother
that tailed you uptown?
There seems to be some mistake.
My name...
Names is for tombstones, baby.
Y'all take this honky out
and waste him - now!
- "Waste him"? ls that a good thing?
- The reading is over.
Nothing about my future?
Us?
Now, promise you'll stay right there.
I shan't be long.
Thank you.
Keep your hands up, honky.
What's he think this is?
Blow his friggin' head off.
Drop it!
Now.
Harold Strutter, CIA. Where were you
when I didn't need you?
It got obvious
you weren't coming out front.
Not even with that clever disguise
you were wearing.
A white face in Harlem.
Good thinking, Bond.
Let's get outta here.
I'm surprised they didn't spot you.
There's a remarkable girl back there
with a deck of cards.
I saw those cards on the way up.
Spades, James. Every one.
You were nailed the minute you left 74.
Only one man can pull together
that much black muscle in this town.
Calls himself Mr Big.
You name the business.
They say he has a black concession.
What would a foreign prime minister
like Kananga
want with an American gangster?
Question is, what would Mr Big
want with a two-bit island diplomat?
Mr Big? Where the hell
does he fit into this mess?
A genuine Felix lighter. Illuminating.
Now listen, James,
Kananga's got a private plane and he's
leaving for San Monique within the hour.
- Get me on the next available flight.
- I already did.
I knew you wouldn't pass up a chance
to get away from where the real action is.
The legendary Baron Samedi, folks.
That's Saturday,
for those who speak French.
Voodoo god of cemeteries
and chief of the legion of the dead.
The man who cannot die.
But, for our purposes,
just a performer in a musical
extravaganza we've cooked up
for you wonderful people.
Good evening. The name's Bond.
I have a reservation.
Mr Bond. Of course.
Mrs Bond's been expecting you.
- Mrs Bond?
- She arrived earlier this afternoon.
Said she preferred
something a little more... private.
Bungalow 1 2.
An incurable romantic - Mrs Bond.
Room service, please.
Room service?
This is Mr Bond. Bungalow 1 2.
I'd like a bottle of Bollinger, please.
Slightly chilled.
Two glasses. Thank you.
Anybody home?
Your champagne, sir.
- What was that?
- Your champagne.
Put it on the table, thanks.
- Shall I open it?
- What?
Shall I open it?
Oh, no. I can manage. Thank you.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
Mrs Bond, I presume?
I'm Rosie Carver.
I guess I have a little explaining to do.
Yes. Either you or
dear Uncle Felix.
Custom 38, Smith & Wesson.
Corrugated three-inch stock,
no serial number, standard CIA issue.
The question is: why point it at me?
The man who delivered your champagne
is not a hotel waiter.
I was just trying to be careful.
As for Felix Leiter, you're right.
I've worked for CIA down here
for some time now.
He cabled me you were coming
and asked if I would help out if I could.
Perhaps you'd better start
by getting your head together.
- There's a mirror in the bathroom.
- Yes.
You're only my second mission,
you know.
My first was Baines.
The agent who was killed.
It's a relief to know I'm next in line
for the same kind of aid.
- There's a...
- A snake! I should have told you.
You should never go in there
without a mongoose.
I should have never
gotten into any of this!
I'm going to be completely useless to you.
I'm sure we'll be able
to lick you into shape.
It's... getting late, Mrs Bond.
Tomorrow will be a very busy day.
You see, Kananga is
protecting something down here.
Something which Baines
obviously discovered.
You're going to show me the spot
where Baines' body was found.
That, I'm afraid,
only leaves us tonight to...
catch up on old times.
Felix told me there'd be
moments like this.
What did good old Felix suggest?
If all else failed,
cyanide pills.
I settled for two bedrooms.
Good night, Mr Bond.
Mrs Bond.
It's just a hat, darling,
belonging to a small-headed man
who lost a fight with a chicken.
It's a warning. Get it outta here!
Oh, please!
Please don't leave me alone tonight.
James, please promise me!
All right, darling,
if you insist... I promise.
Thank you.
Rosie!
Breakfast's up!
Rosie!
- Are you ready yet?
- What?
I have to see about organising a car.
I'll see you in the lobby.
Over here, sir!
Guarantee big fish. Catch big fish, sir!
Hey, baby! Over here!
Bring your man over here!
Just $20! Have a date!
You got warm lady?
We got cold beer over here, man.
You wanna catch a big fish, sir?
It's only 2 over here.
Good morning.
Come on, Rosie.
This one seems eager enough.
Excuse me!
Where can I change?
Me... clothes off... where?
Stop right there.
Turn around slowly.
Keep your hands up!
As I was saying, Quarrel, a lousy agent.
But the compensations
speak for themselves.
Rosie Carver, meet the man
who shares my hairbrush.
Quarrel Junior.
I'm really sorry. I could have shot you.
You might have even killed me
if you'd taken off the safety catch.
Never mind, darling.
You just let us know when we get
to the spot where Baines was killed.
It's up in the hills,
just after we clear the next cove.
Hey, Quarrel!
Who the hell lives up there?
That's the house of the Kananga woman.
She's supposed to have
the power of the obeah.
No one on the island
dare go up there except him.
He comes again.
There will be violence.
He approaches even now.
By land or water?
Water.
He has arrived.
Good.
Rosie's been more efficient
than I anticipated.
I know where
we could rustle up a car.
Beautiful, brave, and now resourceful.
Rosie, you seem to be staging
a remarkable comeback.
Tell me about the future.
Is it death?
I said, is it death?
It is death.
They're coming.
Rosie knows what to do.
Now, I want no bodies this time. No trace.
It's down there.
But... I thought you said
Baines was killed up in the hills, darling.
Up in the hills, down there.
Why don't we have a bite of lunch
and discuss it?
There's an excellent pt in the hamper.
I'm in no hurry.
Are you?
No.
James!
You don't know
what finding you has meant to me.
I can imagine.
And you've no idea
what finding this has meant to me.
You do know what the Queen of Cups
means in an upside-down position?
A deceitful, perverse woman.
A liar, a cheat.
And I'd like some answers now.
Please...
You don't understand, sir.
They'll kill me if I do.
And I'll kill you if you don't.
But you couldn't. You wouldn't.
Not after what we've just done.
I certainly wouldn't
have killed you before.
It used to be a convincing act, Rosie.
It's wearing a little thin now.
It's not an act. It's...
Make your choice.
Rosie!
You will explain what went wrong.
I see the intervention of a woman.
The girl was about to confess.
We had to kill her.
The trap was set.
Tee Hee was waiting.
And you saw death.
It must have been the girl's death.
If you do not ask specific questions,
I cannot be responsible for your
misinterpretation of the answers.
These growing signs of impertinence
begin to disturb me, Solitaire.
As they did with your mother before you.
She had the power and lost it.
Became useless to me.
You will not make the same mistake,
Solitaire.
Where is Bond now?
Where is Bond now?!
I cannot see
when you are this way with me.
Things become unclear.
Let us hope these momentary lapses
do not become a habit.
Your power exists to serve me.
And it is mine to control.
If and when the time comes I decide you
are to lose it, I myself will take it away.
Solitaire, go to sleep. You have made me
angry with you, and I have no wish to be.
Tee Hee...
Put down those cards!
It is a blasphemy!
They tell nothing
to those who cannot see.
But they do. That's a... a bit of luck.
Good luck, for both of us.
The cards say we will be lovers.
You are mistaken.
It's impossible. Forbidden for me.
Now you must go.
But you do believe,...
I mean really believe in the cards?
They have never lied to me.
Then they won't now.
Pick one.
You knew the answer before it was given.
Strangely enough, somehow,...
so did l.
So it's finally happened.
Just as it did to my mother...
and her mother before her.
Of course it did.
You're visual proof of that, aren't you?
Come on, cheer up, darling.
There has to be a first time for everyone.
Now tell me,
where's Kananga?
I cannot see.
- Oh, yes, the cards. I'll get them.
- No!
There's no need to be frightened.
You'll soon be rid of him, I promise.
I promise.
I just need a
Iittle bit of information, that's all.
The power...
I've lost it.
The High Priestess is wife
to the Prince no longer of this world.
The spiritual bridge to the secret church.
It was my fate.
By compelling me to earthly love,
the cards themselves
have taken away my powers.
Darling, I've...
a small confession to make.
Now, try not to be too upset.
The deck was slightly stacked
in my favour.
It makes no difference.
The physical violation cannot be undone.
When he finds out I've lost my power,...
he'll kill me.
Oh, now, come on.
He'll have to find you first.
Lovers' lesson number one:
we have no secrets.
For example, I have a boat waiting.
You can be on it.
All I have to know before we leave is...
what goes on back there in voodoo land.
Darling, three men and a girl
have been killed in the last four days.
Not counting the times
they've tried to stop me
from discovering
what Kananga's protecting.
Now, do you want to be
on that boat or not?
I simply read the cards for him.
I have never been there,
and he's never taken me there.
I've never dared to go.
But I've looked in the cards.
I've seen great riches there.
They'll kill you.
Us, darling.
They will kill us.
Lovers' lesson number two: togetherness.
Till death do us part, or thereabouts.
Is there time before we leave
for lesson number three?
Absolutely.
There's no sense in going off half-cocked.
- This way.
- How can you be so sure?
These scarecrows are to scare
people away. You're not scared, are you?
Lesson number four:
follow the scarecrows.
- Good morning, boss.
- Morning.
It's sure gonna be a beautiful day.
Yes, sir, a beautiful day!
They're heading for the hill.
They're here.
If he finds it, kill him.
Quick!
We've lost him. He has the girl.
They're somewhere under the nets.
At any cost - any - Bond must die.
Unit 2-5. We have picked them up.
Base to 2-5. Arrest Bond.
But I repeat, the girl is not to be touched.
Message received and understood.
Over and out.
Base to all units.
I repeat, the girl is not to be touched.
Get out of the way!
Sweet mother of pearl!
All change! End of the line!
Get down below, quickly!
Here, I'll do that. You get her started.
It appears... a bus.
James!
He'll be looking for me now.
I know he'll never stop.
Come on, darling.
It's all over.
Voodoo land was just poppy fields.
A simple matter of heroin smuggling.
I'll have a word with a man named Felix,
turn the case over to him,
and you and I will be off.
By the way, where would you like to go?
Anywhere where we can find
one of these.
How quickly can we make it
to New Orleans?
Santa Mina, four hours away...
You could catch a flight
and be there in the morning.
Get in touch with Felix. Tell him to meet
me there tomorrow. Royal Orleans Hotel.
Tampa is closer.
Hamilton was killed in New Orleans,
so there has to be a connection.
And this is a valuable piece
of merchandise we're carrying.
Which, with any luck, they'll want back.
Royal Orleans Hotel, please.
Are you sure this is the way
to New Orleans?
I don't know, but this sure
beats the hell out of Harlem, don't it?
Well, hello, Jim!
What's happenin', baby?
Just ease back now, Jim. Relax!
Mr Big wants to see you.
You made a mistake
back on that island, Bond.
You took something that didn't belong
to you, from a friend of Mr Big's.
That type of mistake
is tough to bounce back from.
- But I've only just arrived.
- Today is your lucky day, Jim!
You're going skydiving!
There's a helluva view of the lake
from 10,000 feet.
My only regret is I won't be there to see it.
Let's go!
- Good morning. You're...
- Mrs Bell.
You're not my instructor.
Where's Mr Bleeker?
Indisposed. I'll be giving the lesson.
What's on for today?
Let's just wing it, shall we, Mrs Bell?
You're over-revving.
- Leroy, slow down, for Pete's sake!
- Do what the man say!
I can't... I can't find the brake!
Close those doors!
Holy shit!
OK, Don. Don't worry,
I'll take care of it. Right.
Talk to you later.
I've got to go and give a lesson.
Same time tomorrow, Mrs Bell?
Yes, Mr Bleeker.
Yes, sir. I know you just can't
glue the wings back on.
Now, Mr Bleeker, I'm sure
there's no reason for name-calling.
That's fine. Don't forget the double vents.
I appreciate she's one of your best pupils.
That's a little frantic.
I'll keep the other three.
Any such suggestion
should be put in writing to Washington.
- How is Mrs Bell?
- Intensive care, but she'll pull through.
Yes, sir.
No one's questioning your patriotism.
I'm sure you're a veteran, sir.
Felix, find out if there's
a Fillet Of Soul restaurant in town.
We're way ahead of you. It's on
Docker Street. Strutter's watching it now.
Hell of a send-off.
This way.
- Where's Strutter?
- He's gotta be inside somewhere.
Two, gentlemen?
I got a nice booth over here,
just against the wall.
Do you think you could find something
a little closer to the stage?
- What's wrong with a booth?
- I once had a nasty turn in a booth.
- Bourbon. No ice, please.
- Two Sazeracs.
Where's your sense of adventure?
This is New Orleans. Relax!
- One of you Felix Leiter?
- Yeah, right here.
- Call for you. A guy called Strutter.
- Thanks.
For a minute, I thought Harry
was laying down on a job.
What happened to my...
- What happened to my friend?
- What happened? Listen.
Thanks for droppin' in, baby.
Yeah, you're one tough pig to nail down.
You've been picking at me
like some kind of maggot.
First, you go up to Harlem
and kill one of the brothers.
And that disturbed me.
And then you go and steal
this valuable young lady
from my good friend, Dr Kananga.
Now, old Kananga, he believes
in all that card crap.
I mean, he's mad.
Well, possession being
nine points of the law,
I would say Kananga
is your problem now.
Thank you.
In fact, if I were you,
I'd... watch my step from now on.
Yeah, well, you just let me handle
our business with the man.
I got my own plans for you, baby.
But first
there's one little question
that he wants answers for.
Then you'd better ship me back
to the island and let him ask in person.
I'm not in the habit
of giving answers to lackeys.
You damn lucky you got an ear left
to hear the question with.
Which is... did you mess with that?
That's between Solitaire and myself...
and Kananga. I'll tell him when I see him.
You won't see sunlight
unless you answer!
I'd no idea you were so frightened of him.
Did you touch her?!
When I see Kananga.
Right.
Quite revealing.
Kananga: poppy grower
in thousands of acres
of well-camouflaged fields,
protected by the voodoo threat
of Baron Samedi.
Then there's Mr Big,
distributor and wholesaler through
a chain of Fillet Of Soul restaurants.
Wholesale?
Sell heroin, for money?!
My apologies. I'm sure
you simply give it away.
Excellent, Mr Bond.
That's precisely what I intend to do.
Two tons of it, to be exact.
When entering into
a fiercely competitive field,
one finds it advisable
to give away free samples.
Man or woman, black or white.
I don't discriminate.
Two tons of heroin with a street value
well over a billion dollars
nationally distributed free?
That should make a certain group of
families rather angry, wouldn't you say?
Angry?
Why, my dear Mr Bond,
it'll positively drive them
out of their minds.
- And subsequently out of the business.
- Quite ingenious.
A sort of junkies' welfare system.
Merely until the number of addicts
in the country has doubled, shall we say?
Then I will market that acreage
you blundered into the other day.
That heroin will be very expensive indeed,
leaving myself and the phone company
the only two going monopolies
in this nation for years to come.
And here I thought it was Solitaire
who did the fortune-telling.
Let's hope for both your sakes
she still can.
The question still stands, Mr Bond.
Asked by the gentleman concerned.
Did you touch her?
Well, it's not the sort of question...
a gentleman answers.
Well, having set the example,
I don't expect Miss Solitaire
to be any less the lady.
By the way,
that's a particularly handsome watch
you're wearing, Mr Bond.
- May I see it, please?
- You'll forgive me if I don't get up.
Butterhook!
Tee Hee.
On the first wrong answer
from Miss Solitaire,
you will snip the little finger
of Mr Bond's right hand.
Starting with the second wrong answer,
you will proceed
to the more... vital areas.
Solitaire,
my dear,
I want you to listen to me very carefully.
On the back of Mr Bond's watch
the registration number: 3-2-6-
Do I speak the truth?
You speak the truth.
Well,...
if nothing else,
at least I've laid your fears to rest.
My compliments on a splendid operation.
There is one thing, however, the...
Whisper.
Take him to the farm.
When do we start back?
Soon, Solitaire.
Soon.
Solitaire, why?
I treated you well. You lacked for nothing.
I don't understand what you...
Mr Bond's watch, my dear.
I gave you every break possible.
You had a 50-50 chance.
You weren't even close.
I had no choice.
Please believe me... The cards!
When the time came, I myself
would have given you love.
You knew that.
You knew that!
There's only one proper way
to deal with this.
And one proper time.
The tonnage order is nearly complete.
We move it out tonight.
And I mean tonight!
Mr Bond.
How much do you know
about crocodiles, Bond?
I've... always tried
to keep them at arm's length myself.
Cute little nippers, ain't they?
I don't suppose those potential
overnight bags are orphans.
Oh, no! We have
some moms and dads as well.
In fact, quite a few thousand.
This is the part I like best: feeding time.
I suspect, the highlight of the tour.
Some of these babies
live to be 200 years old.
Look over there.
That's an alligator.
You can always tell by its round nose.
There's old Albert.
He's a croc.
Got careless with him some time back,
and he took my whole arm off.
Well done, Albert!
They'll eat anything. Even each other.
Then again, sometime they can go
a whole year without eating.
I was rather counting on that.
There are two ways
to disable a crocodile, you know.
I... don't suppose you'd care
to share that information with me?
One way is to jam a pencil
into the depression hole behind his eyes.
And the other?
The other's twice as simple.
You just put your hand in his mouth
and pull his teeth out.
Fire!
Evans, get him!
Adam, in the car! Head him off!
Hector, move, damn it!
Bond ripped off one of our boats.
He's headed for the lrish Bayou.
The man that gets him, stays alive!
Now move, you mothers!
Toby.
I got me a regular Ben Hur down here.
Doin' 95, minimum.
- Need any help, JW?
- Hell, no!
You got a set of wheels
that just won't quit, boy!
If they's yours, that is.
You spin around, boy.
Ten fingers on the fender.
Legs apart.
I'm sure this ain't exactly your debut
at this sort of thing.
You picked the wrong parish
to haul ass through, boy.
Nobody cuts and runs
on Sheriff JW Pepper.
And that's him speakin' that, by the bye!
What the...
JW?
Soon as you nail that offendin' vehicle,
Miss Pearsonjust called.
Seems her dog's
foamin' all at the mouth.
She's got him locked up in the shed
and wondered ifyou'd like to
come over and shoot it for her.
You tell Miss Pearson to take a flyin'...
That look like a boat stuck
in the Sheriff's car there, Eddie?
Boy, where you been all your life?
That there's one of them new car-boats.
By the powers invested in me
by this parish,
I hereby do commandeer this vehicle
and all those persons within.
And that means you, smartass!
Unit 23 in position.
Ten-four, 23. Come in, 28.
Hey, JW. Seems like Deke Rogers
done got his boat stole offthe river
but got a new one in his swimming pool.
- Sheriff, get your boys offmy frequency!
- Give me that!
Now you listen to me, trooper boy!
We got a swamp full of Black Russians
drivin' boats to beat the band down here!
Relax, Sheriff. We've got a roadblock
waiting for them at Miller's Bridge.
Unit 26 at Miller's Bridge.
We're just about all set here.
Make that secure there! D'you hear?
OK, fellas. Here they come!
All right, out of my way!
I'm in charge here!
You two boys, come on!
I want those two men and
their boats apprehended immediately!
Yes, sir, Captain. I understand.
But, I don't know where we're gonna find
a boat fast enough to catch 'em.
Call my brother-in-law, Billy Bob. He's got
the fastest boat on the whole damn river.
Billy Bob'll sure enough fix their ass!
Yeah, call Billy Bob.
There's two boats, Billy Bob.
They're movin' like buttered pigs!
Now, I promised these boys here
you'd get 'em. Don't let me down.
Cool down, JW. I'm on my way.
- Want something, boy?
- Yes. I'd like to borrow this boat, if I may.
Everybody on the river
would like to borrow this boat.
Billy Bob, we've got 'em spotted.
They're headed for Hayley's Landing.
That's my brother-in-law!
That's Billy Bob!
He'll get 'em! Billy Bob'll get 'em!
Hot damn!
If one side of the Pepper family
don't get 'em, the other side will! Let's go!
If any man can show just cause why they
may not lawfully be joined together,
Iet him now speak, or else hereafter...
Headquarters to all units.
Suspects seen proceeding down
by Liberty towards Highway 11.
Proceed with caution.
Would you get that chicken coop
off the road?!
Did you ever think of gettin'
a driver's licence, boy?!
Are you sure that was
your brother-in-law, Sheriff?
- Felix, what are you doing here?
- We'll get to that later.
Kananga's in town. He's got your girl.
They just took off.
There's the son of a bitch! I got him!
What are you?
Some kind of doomsday machine, boy?
Well, we've got a cage strong enough
to hold an animal like you here!
- Captain, enlighten the sheriff, please.
- Yes, sir.
JW, let me have a word with you.
JW, now this fella's
from London, England.
He's an Englishman workin'
in cooperation with our boys.
- A sort of secret agent.
- Secret agent?!
On whose side?!
We busted the Fillet of Soul an hour ago.
We came up with nothing but these.
Kananga's clear.
You should have seen the size
of the guy on the boat with him.
Nine feet tall, I swear.
Big top hat, a cockamamie flute
in one hand and Solitaire in the other.
The incendiary bombs
are set for midnight.
Now, that gives you exactly... 30 minutes.
Watch out for sharks on the way back.
We'll see you for breakfast, Felix.
Good hunting!
You're going to need these
and the shark gun on the way back.
Seems like the party's started.
My regards to Baron Samedi, man -
right between the eyes.
Trouble!
Mr Bond! There you are!
And Miss Solitaire as well.
Hardly unexpected, but most welcome.
Whisper!
Two more glasses for our guests!
- What shall we drink to, Mr Bond?
- How about an earthquake?
Welcome home. Where's our boy?
He'll be along any time now.
I checked behind a rock
and his wet suit is gone.
Keep the change.
It is unfortunate your wet suit was found
only minutes before
the field was destroyed.
Don't tell me you're not insured?
The poppy is a very sturdy flower.
You have been
a relatively minor nuisance, in fact.
But this gun...
I find it particularly fascinating.
What is it?
A shark gun, naturally.
With compressed gas pellets.
Ingenious!
Don't
pull the pin out. The air in here
is foul enough already.
Somehow I never thought of you
as a poor loser.
I was hoping you would join me
to drink to the future.
Miss Solitaire used to know all about
the future. Especially predicting death.
An underground monorail.
Connected to the last refuge
of a scoundrel, no doubt.
The heroin leaves here, I take it,
carried somewhere by that winch.
Correct again, Mr Bond.
What a quick study you are.
Let me show you exactly how it works.
Where in hell can the man be?
Relax!
He must have got tied up somewhere.
These cans hold 25 pounds each.
There are 20 cans to a shipment,
packed in watertight
metal containers.
It's your show, but isn't there
a simpler way of drowning someone?
Drown, Mr Bond?
I doubt you'd get the chance to drown.
Perhaps we could try something
on an even simpler vein.
On the contrary, Mr Bond,
I think you'll find those wounds quite
fatal.
Whisper...
The gate.
Slowly, Whisper, slowly, slowly.
Let our diners assemble.
Look out!
Where's Kananga?
He always did have
an inflated opinion of himself.
Oh, James!
How do we get out of here?
We take the train, of course.
Thanks for everything, Felix.
See you tomorrow night at the 21 Club.
Why do you want to travel this way?
What the hell can the two of you do
on the train for 16 hours?
Say goodbye to Felix, darling.
Now, the first thing to learn
in playing gin rummy
is never take a card from the exposed
pile unless you really need it.
Gin.
James! What are you doing?
Just testing an old adage.
"Unlucky at cards..."
- Do hurry up, James.
- Won't be a moment, darling.
Lock the door as well on your way up,
would you, James?
After all, we wouldn't want anyone
to just walk in on us, would we?
For the first time in my life,
I feel like a complete woman.
The slightest touch of your hand...
I was always so afraid that
a part of me would stay with the past.
But now I know
there's no chance of that any longer.
To be able to reach out and touch you...
Mr Bond. It's good to see you again.
Well, that wasn't very funny!
Now what are you doing?
Just being disarming, darling.
Nick Nack! Tabasco!
Right away, Monsieur Scaramanga!
Hey.
Half. You get the rest later.
Wait for him in there. Through that door.
He will join you in a minute.
Your steam bath is ready,
Monsieur Scaramanga.
Oh, that would have been too easy.
It's locked.
You'll have to look elsewhere, monsieur.
Hey, Al.
Al, wherever you are,
don't hold it against me.
I wonder where you can find your gun,
Monsieur Scaramanga.
Your little golden gun.
Where can it be?
we haven't had before.
I wonder what it can be.
I fooled you!
You're getting warmer.
Much warmer.
Now, how are you going
to get down the stairs?
So near and yet so far.
Bravo, Monsieur Scaramanga.
You've done it again.
- This one was the best, "n'est-ce pas"?
- Not bad. Not bad at all.
But you'll have to do better
to come into my money.
I'll get you yet,
and I'll enjoy every sou you leave me.
You'll be the death of me yet, Nick Nack.

Colthorpe.
Chief of Staff.
What do you know
about a man called Scaramanga, 007?
Scaramanga?
Oh, yes! The Man with the Golden Gun.
Born in a circus. Father, the ringmaster.
Mother, English. A snake charmer.
A spectacular trick-shot artist by the time
he was ten and a local Rio gunman at 15.
The KGB trained him in Europe,
where he became
an overworked, underpaid assassin.
He went independent in the '50s.
Current price: One million dollars a hit.
No... er... photograph on file.
But he does have one distinguishing
feature, however. A superfluous papilla.
- A what?
- A mammary gland. A third nipple, sir.
He always uses a golden bullet,
hence "Man with the Golden Gun".
Present domicile unknown.
I think that's all.
Why, sir?
Hm! Charming trinket.
- Even has my number on it.
- Precisely.
Obviously it's useless as a bullet.
Who would pay a million dollars
to have me killed?
Jealous husbands, outraged chefs,
humiliated tailors. The list is endless.
Moreover, this trinket, as you call it,
was sent with a note
requesting "special delivery" to you.
- It's initialled with an S.
- Scaramanga's fingerprints were on it.
They've been verified by the CIA.
- Why would he alert me?
- Psychological.
He counts on his reputation
to terrify his intended victim.
Thank you, gentlemen.
I'm relieving you
of your present assignment, 007.
- Er, sir?
- Yes?
The energy crisis is still with us.
I submit that finding Gibson and his solar
cell data is more important than ever.
It is indeed.
And I can't jeopardise it or any mission
by having Scaramanga put a bullet in you.
I'll endorse your request to resign.
Or you can take a sabbatical
and go to ground until this is settled.
Or until he kills me.
Nobody knows where he is
or what he looks like.
So I think it's fair to assume
that he has the edge on you.
Wouldn't you agree? That's all, 007.
If I found him first, sir,
that might change the situation.
Dramatically, wouldn't you say?
Good day, Bond.
Moneypenny, Fairbanks.
- Alaska.
- No. Bill Fairbanks, 002.
Oh, poor Bill.
- I miss him.
- The Man with the Golden Gun didn't.
Officially that was never confirmed.
Where was 002 when it happened?
Beirut, '69.
In a cabaret with a lady called Saida.
Beirut, hm?
Moneypenny,
you are better than a computer.
In all sorts of ways.
But you never take advantage of them.
- Miss Moneypenny.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, just one moment, darling.
Yes, James?
Why wasn't Scaramanga
confirmed as the killer?
Because they couldn't find the bullet!
Darling!
Ahmed.
Ahmed!
Entrez.
Good evening.
My name is Bond. James Bond.
Your dancing is superb.
- Merci.
And you are very handsome.
Well, I don't usually intrude like this,
but I... I believe we had a mutual friend.
- Bill Fairbanks.
- Fairbanks?
Yes.
I am told you were with him
when he was rather, er...
rudely interrupted.
Ah, "mais oui" - Bill!
What a terrible night. I will never forget it.
- Did you see who shot him?
- No, I was in his arms.
- My eyes were closed.
- At least he died happy.
The bullet went through him.
- Through his back and ended up there?
- No, no, through his neck.
I take it out of the wall
before the police arrive.
And now it is my lucky charm.
I never dance without it.
I'm sure Bill would have loved that.
But let us forget the past.
Mm! I was hoping you'd say that.
Are you staying long in Beirut?
Oh, it depends.
Clumsy of me.
You really do have
a magnificent abdomen.
Oh, my perfumes! No!
I've lost my charm!
Not from where "I'm" standing.
Taxi? Hotel, mister?
No. To the nearest pharmacy.
Dumdum bullets like this
flatten on impact
for maximum wounding effect.
- Very nasty.
- Yes, I'm sure it is.
But just tell me
where it was made and by whom.
Well, fortunately it's all in one piece.
Which leads us to deduce
it was fired from a 4.2 millimetre gun.
Colthorpe, there's no such thing
as a 4.2 millimetre gun.
The fact that no recognised munitions
manufacturer, military or civil,
produces such a bullet
doesn't mean it doesn't exist, 007.
Q Branch have been making irregular
calibres for most unusual purposes.
- And we don't put markings on them.
- Making identification almost impossible.
You mean we can't trace it? You've
no idea what it went through to get here.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
The workmanship is undemanding
according to our standards.
Soft 23-carat gold with traces of... nickel.
Hardly ever used in Europe.
Comes from India.
Far East?
- Why not India?
- Nickel content obviously too low, 007.
- Lazar?
- Lazar!
Hm. Imaginative.
Highly specialised.
Yes, I concur.
- Well, what the hell is Lazar?
- Not what. Who. Portuguese.
- Lives in Macau.
- Chap who made the bullet, 007.
I hate to interrupt your dinner,
but does Senhor Lazar live here?
Lazar.
I was given this address. Does he...
Senhor Lazar?
My name's Bond. James Bond.
An unexpected honour, Mr Bond.
Your reputation precedes you.
This way, please.
It would be my proudest moment if
I could make something for you, Mr Bond.
A rifle, perhaps.
Now, here we have
an interesting problem.
A custom-built model for a client
who recently lost two fingers. Please.
- Also lost his trigger.
- It is housed in the butt.
Squeeze it.
The sights are a bit off.
You have five fingers. The butt
is balanced for the pressure of three.
That is why you were one inch too low.
Here you will find only
craftsmanship and quality.
Mass production,
your Walther PPK, for instance,
I leave to others.
What about ammunition?
Designed to individual requirements,
whatever they may be.
In gold... if I wanted?
- I have already done that for a client.
- I know you have.
Francisco Scaramanga.
My relationship with a client, Mr Bond,
is strictly confidential.
Like a doctor. A priest with a penitent.
Oh, of course!
Yet you make guns
for fingerless hoodlums,
bullets for assassins.
Mr Bond, bullets do not kill.
It is the finger that pulls the trigger.
Exactly!
I'm now aiming precisely at your groin.
So speak or for ever hold your peace.
I have never seen him.
On a cost-per-bullet basis,
he must be your best customer.
True, but unfortunately
he only fires them occasionally.
When was the, er... last shipment?
This is impossible. I can't...
You're quite right.
An inch too low.
I have just completed an order
for immediate delivery.
- Who collects them?
- I swear, I do not know.
My instructions are to go to the casino.
I am paid and they vanish.
in Hong Kong harbour,
one of the busiest ports in the world.
passports and landing cards ready,
in order to avoid unnecessary delay.
of the famous liner Queen Elizabeth,
mysterious circumstances in 1971.
and on your right, Hong Kong Island.
Taxi!
Follow that Rolls.
Madam, would you be good enough
to move this inverted bedpan?
Sorry I'm late, James, but your signal
from Macau just reached the office.
You're a great help, Goodnight.
Now, get on to Licence Bureau
and trace that car. AU 603, a green Rolls.
A green Rolls?
A green Rolls-Royce.
There can't be that many in Hong Kong.
Courtesy cars. All green Rolls-Royces
belong to the Peninsula Hotel.
You see what a two-year posting
to Staff Intelligence does for a girl?
James, it's wonderful to see you.
- Where are you going?
- I need some information.
The subject under surveillance
is in room 602.
I'll buy you dinner, but first
I have official business to attend to.
Yes, I saw the "official business".
Goodnight, would I do that to you
after two years?
Yes, you bloody well would!
- Please.
- I can manage.
You could open a door for me, though.
- I open champagne?
- No, it's a surprise.
Oh! A surprise!
Good afternoon.
- A water pistol?
- Pass me that robe.
Turn around.
Do you always take a shower
with a pistol?
Put your hands up and get out of here!
- Keep on walking.
- But you haven't answered my question.
Reception. Can I help you?
This is Miss Anders. Room 602.
Put those down!
I see why these packets carry
a government warning.
Give me that!
They certainly can damage your health.
- Ow! You're hurting my arm.
- Then tell me where those bullets go.
- No, I can't.
- Try!
- He'll kill me!
- Who?
I can't tell you!
Scaramanga.
You see what you can do when you try?
You work for him?
I don't work for him.
He's, um... I'm his...
Oh. So he's a lover too.
Only before he kills.
Bullfighters do the same thing.
Claims it improves the eye.
His eye is on me. Where can I find him?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I said where?!
I don't know!
He doesn't tell me everything.
I know he has a date
at the Bottoms Up Club tonight.
How will I recognise him?
- Tall, slim and dark.
- So is my aunt.
- Anything distinctive about him?
- Yes, but how can I...
He is not like other people. He has three...
Oh.
Fascinating anatomical titbit, but the most
useless piece of information I ever heard.
Unless the Bottoms Up is a strip club
and Scaramanga is performing there.
You'll have to do better.
He usually wears
a white linen suit, black tie,
and jewellery, all gold.
You're improving.
I don't want you to twist my arm again.
I don't want to either.
So I'll tell you what you're going to do.
You're going to take the bullets
to Mr Scaramanga,
because, if he doesn't get them,
he may not show up at the Bottoms Up.
And I want him there.
- Why should you trust me?
- I don't.
But neither will Mr Scaramanga, if he
hears about this interesting conversation.
Who knows? He may even use
one of those little golden bullets on you.
And that would be a pity,
because they're "very" expensive.
I'll take them to him.
Let's drink to that.
Bottoms up!
- Soda or ginger ale?
- Ginger ale, please.
Police! Drop it!
Drop it!
You're under arrest.
Move away from there!
If you take the trouble to examine
that gun, you'll notice it hasn't been fired.
Anything you have to say,
you can say at the station.
I'm charging him under Section 473.
- I didn't see your identity card.
- You will.
Here.
- I thought we were going to the station.
- Kowloon side.
Kowloon's over there!
We're going to the New Territories!
Welcome aboard, Commander Bond.
This way, sir.
Down the hatchway, please.
Good evening, sir.
Would you follow me, please?
It certainly gives you a new slant.
What with the Chinese on one side
and the US fleet on the other,
down here's the only place
in Hong Kong you can't be bugged.
And with current real-estate prices
in Hong Kong, quite practical. Any luck?
A Chinese fighter we salvaged.
Good evening, 007.
Glad to see you're still with us.
In future, Commander Bond, if you must
tour the world of Suzie Wong by night,
- inform our man here. Lieutenant Hip.
- Sorry, Commander.
I had to get you away from the police,
but didn't know how much you knew.
Nothing.
But I should report, sir, that Scaramanga
does not have a contract on me.
He couldn't have missed me tonight.
Instead he hit a chap at a club.
- I got a shock when I saw who it was.
- I should think you did.
Our missing solar-energy expert: Gibson.
Yes. Gibson. He was prepared
to come back under certain conditions.
That's why I'm here
with Professor Frazier.
Lieutenant Hip
was making a preliminary contact.
I almost wish that Scaramanga
had a contract on you.
Was Gibson cooperative?
He wanted to bargain for immunity.
Suggested another meeting in Bangkok.
- Why Bangkok?
- I think he worked there for Hai Fat.
That name's come up before.
A multimillionaire.
Head of Hai Fat Enterprises.
All legitimate, as far as we know.
What did Gibson
propose bargaining with?
A solex. Claimed it was 95% efficient.
If he developed a solar cell that efficient,
he solved the energy crisis.
So you've told me.
Coal and oil will soon be depleted.
Uranium's too dangerous.
Geothermal and tidal control
too expensive. I know all that.
- Where's the solex now?
- Solex "agitator", sir.
"The" essential unit to convert
radiation from the sun into electricity
on an industrial basis. It's only that size.
It won't take long to check out Gibson's
efficiency claim. This is exciting!
May I see it, Lieutenant?
He showed it to me at the bar
and replaced it in his pocket.
And after he was shot,
it wasn't there.
I looked.
Gentlemen, I congratulate you.
Instead of getting a perfected solex,
we're left with a useless corpse
and no leads.
One lead, sir.
Assuming Gibson
was killed by Scaramanga,
whoever hired him
could afford a million dollars.
- Are you suggesting Hai Fat?
- He could afford it.
Out of petty cash.
A thought has occurred to me.
If Hai Fat hired Scaramanga,
- it's unlikely that he met him personally.
- Why?
If anything had gone wrong,
there's nothing to connect the two.
That gives me an idea
as to how to approach him.
Q, I'll... need this.
- Really, 007!
- Oh, I admit it's a little kinky.
You'll take Miss Goodnight with you.
- Goodnight, sir?
- After tonight's debacle,
an efficient liaison officer
wouldn't come amiss.
Thank you, sir.
You won't get near Hai Fat.
I have relatives in Bangkok.
I have often passed his place.
He lives in a house on a mountain
surrounded by guards.
No way!
The place is crawling with guards.
Have a look.
Hai Fat takes his privacy very seriously.
I'm sure he'll see me.
Good morning. How's the water?
Why don't you come in and find out?
- Sounds very tempting, Miss, er...
- Chew Mee.
Really?
There's only one problem.
I have no swimming trunks.
Neither have I.
What are you doing here?
Get out!
Immediately.
I will have you...
Please forgive me, Mr Scaramanga.
Excuse me, Chew Mee.
Bye-ee.
You understand my surprise.
I thought it was understood.
We were never to meet, Mr Scaramanga.
I always thought
your abnormality was a myth.
Some cults consider it a sign of
invulnerability and great sexual prowess.
I've learned to live with it.
Why are you here?
Bond. James Bond.
- Do I know the gentleman?
- Well, he knows you.
Without being immodest, there are few
people in this part of the world who don't.
And there are very few people
who haven't heard of Bond.
British Secret Service,
007, licensed to kill.
He's good, even by my standards.
- He was near the Bottoms Up Club.
- A coincidence.
I don't believe in them.
The man's a menace.
He knows something.
Are you suggesting I invest
another million to remove him?
That's up to you.
I will give it some thought.
Since you have chosen to meet me,
perhaps you will dine here tonight.
- I'll be delighted.
- Nine o'clock, then.
Ling Po, see this gentleman out.
Don't tell me you saw him?!
He even invited me to dinner.
He must have found me quite titillating.
In due time, I shall be laid to rest
here in my mausoleum
after a useful, happy, long life.
And I do not intend
to allow Mr Bond to shorten it.
I'll get the car.
- You know I'd rather be dining with you.
- I understand, James. Please hurry back.
I'll ring as soon as I do.
A midnight snack might be just the thing.
I'll keep the wine properly chilled.
And everything else warm, I trust.
Bye-bye!
And everything else warm?!
I hope you don't mind
giving my nieces a lift.
Good evening.
Hai Fat's is on the way.
I'll drop the girls, come back and wait.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
The name's Scaramanga.
Mr Fat is expecting me.
Grislyland.
A pleasant evening.
Get him! Come on!
Stop it!
Not here.
This is my home.
Take Mr Bond to school.
Heaven.
Definitely heaven.
Tashman.
Chula.
Chula! Chula! Chula!
Chula! Chula! Chula!
Are you all right?
- How did you find me?
- Hai Fat owns this place.
Stand back, girls.
Forgot to tell you!
Their father runs a karate school.
Hang on!
What you might call
a Mexican screw-up, gentlemen!
Pretty lady, 100 bahts.
- No, no.
- 80 bahts.
Pretty lady, real elephant. 60 bahts.
Missy, yesa!
Elephant. Bargain, mister. 100 bahts.
Elephant! Real elephant.
You are very handsome man. 40 bahts.
For you, mister, 20 bahts.
Sonny, I'll give you 20,000 bahts
if you can make this heap go any faster.
- I'm afraid I'll have to owe you.
- Bloody tourist! 20,000 bahts!
Goddamn little brown water hog!
Oh, what's the matter, JW, huh?
You just try that in "my" bayou, boy!
I'd haul your ass!
Oh, look, JW. I just gotta have me
one of those cute little elephants.
Elephants!
We're Democrats, Maybelle.
If you got your little pointy heads
out of them pajamas,
you wouldn't be late for work.
I knew it!
You pointy-heads has no more idea
of traffic control than a gooney bird!
Get your cotton-picking schnoz
out of my pants. Hear now?
Boy, you is ugly.
JW?
Where are you?
What do they teach in that school?
Ballet dancing?
I find nothing remotely amusing
about Mr Bond's escape.
You underestimated him.
Even my influence doesn't extend
into the British Secret Service.
I shall lie low too.
I won't jeopardise a project
in which I've invested half my fortune,
when it's ready to yield billions.
- Where will you hide out?
- That does not concern you.
Take this.
Return it to the plant and
don't leave there without my permission.
May I remind you that you work for me.
I took you on as a junior partner to be an
occasional convenience. Nothing more.
I did not hire you to interfere in my affairs.
- Is that clearly understood?
- Oh, yes, very clearly.
I now regret having even considered
employing your services,
but that is beside the point.
Bond doesn't know you're in Bangkok.
He's never seen you, but he knows me.
That's the problem.
That's no problem.
What happened?
Mr Fat has just resigned.
I'm the new chairman of the board.
He always did like that mausoleum.
Put him in it.
Sorry about that, darling. It was Hip.
Still no sign of Hai Fat. Every inquiry
gets a polite Oriental brushoff.
With the compliments.
"Phuyuck"?
'74, sir.
- I approve.
- You do?
Oh, not the wine. Your frock.
Tight in all the right places.
Not too many buttons.
Standard uniform for Southeast Asia.
The buttons are down the back.
Designed by Q, no doubt.
One of them's a suicide pill, I suppose.
No. But the bottom one has a homer in it.
How original.
Per ora e per il momento che verr.
"To this moment,
and the moment yet to come."
In our profession, I'm afraid, you never
can count on that moment to come.
Who knows where you and I will be
this time next year?
Opposite sides of the world, most likely.
That's too far apart.
Now, if Hip doesn't come up with a lead,
there's really nothing very much
for us to do tonight.
Or is there?
Oh, darling, I'm tempted.
But killing a few hours
as one of your passing fancies
isn't quite my scene.
Phuyuck!
Ah! Goodnight. What a pleasant surprise.
My hard-to-get act
didn't last very long, did it?
I was trained
to expect the unexpected, but...
they never prepared me
for anything like you in a nightie.
James, I thought
this would never happen.
- What made you change your mind?
- I'm weak.
Don't move!
Miss Anders! I didn't recognise you
with your clothes on.
I bribed a bellboy to let me in.
I've come to warn you,
you're in great danger.
I usually am. That's why I use
the old three-pillow trick.
Please believe me.
I'm risking my life to come here.
Well, your concern for my wellbeing
is touching,
but puzzles me.
- Scaramanga is in Bangkok.
- He was in Hong Kong, but not after me.
We've been through that routine.
He's a monster. I hate him.
Then leave him.
You don't walk out on Scaramanga.
- There's no place he wouldn't find me.
- You need a good lawyer.
I need 007.
Who do you think sent that bullet
to London with your number on it?
I did.
And it wasn't easy
getting his fingerprint on the note.
Forgive me
if I've been slow on the uptake.
Don't you see you're the only man
in the world who can kill him?
Now, what gives you that idea?
The way Scaramanga speaks about you.
- Even has a likeness of you.
- I'm flattered.
I want him dead.
Name your price. Anything, I'll pay it.
You can have me too, if you like.
I'm not unattractive.
At last you're starting to tell the truth.
I've dreamed about you setting me free.
I've been dreaming about a solex agitator.
Ever heard of one?
Perhaps you can have that too.
- No, my clothes are in there.
- Get in.
- I'll kill that woman.
- Later!
Charming.
It was an inspiration, sending that bullet.
You're late.
It was a double feature.
What are you doing?
Putting my jewellery away.
You can come out now.
- What time is it?
- Two-ish.
Two? You mean
I've been in here for two hours?
All in the line of duty.
Duty! I'm resigning in the morning!
Goodnight, don't let us down.
The Service needs women like you.
Well, obviously you don't!
Forgive me, darling.
Your turn will come, I promise.
As soon as she brings me that solex.
- For killing Scaramanga?
- If she gets me the solex agitator first.
First?
James, you must be good.
Oh. We'll find out about that
the next time I meet her.
She's making the arrangements.
Sorry I'm late.
Bangkok traffic's worse than Piccadilly.
He's made contact.
- How's the charm boy doing?
- Need you ask?
Meet you outside.
Did you bring it?
Darling, I left it in your handbag.
It must be in here somewhere, dear.
I saw the man in the shop give it to you.
Without the ticket, we can't get a receipt.
You won't find it in there, Mr Bond.
I looked before you came.
I wouldn't do that either. Look behind you.
Lower.
A gun in a bag of peanuts. How original.
What will they think of next?
My name is Scaramanga.
Francisco Scaramanga.
I feel I know you, although
I never thought we should ever meet.
It's a very great pleasure for me, Mr Bond,
thanks to Miss Anders.
You've a strange way
of showing gratitude.
A mistress cannot serve two masters.
A difficult shot, but most gratifying.
Well, we, er... all get our jollies
one way or another.
Mine have always been guns, Mr Bond.
When I was a boy
I was brought up in a circus.
My only real friend
was a magnificent African bull elephant.
One day his handler mistreated him
and he went berserk.
Bleeding, dying,
he came and found me.
Stood on one leg - his best trick -
picked me up and put me on his back.
The man emptied the gun into his eye.
- I emptied my stage pistol into his.
- An eye for an eye. Nut?
You see, Mr Bond,
I always thought I liked animals.
Then I discovered that
I liked killing people even more.
Keep this. Whatever you do, don't lose it.
- I have to help James.
- Something's wrong?
- There's a midget with a gun on him.
- A midget?
Same one I saw at the Bottoms Up.
The girl is dead. Call the police!
Forget the girl. She's replaceable.
And I shall find what she stole from me.
Personally, I have nothing against you,
so let's hope our paths never cross again.
Please don't try to follow me.
Your peanut-toting friend back there
wouldn't like it.
No, he wouldn't.
You want to try one of mine?
- Where's the solex?
- With Goodnight.
- Where's Goodnight?
- Outside.
She must be by the car.
Women! Walkie-talkie.
- Goodnight, where are you?
- Somebody locked me in a boot.
- The midget's car. I'm locked in.
Number 7543.
- The keys!
- I haven't got them.
Oh, no.
- Oh, I've got the keys.
And I've got the solex too.
Taxi!
Stay in there, Goodnight.
We've got you spotted.
Taxi! Taxi!
Taxi!
- How 'bout a demonstration, boy?
- Certainly, sir.
What the hell is goin' on?!
Now... I know you!
Oh, no.
You're that secret agent.
That English secret agent from England.
You're chasin' somebody.
Who are you after this time, boy?
Commies?
Let's go get 'em! I'm with you all the way.
Uh-oh. I think we've got trouble.
Pull your cars over,
you little brown pointy-heads!
I'm a peace officer!
James? Are you still there?
James!
Can you hear me? James!
All right, Goodnight. Don't panic.
- Who's that?
- It's, er...
- It's Headquarters.
- Let me talk to 'em.
Hello. This is Sheriff JW Pepper,
Louisiana State Police.
and tell her I'm on a mission.
I've been deputised. Right?
Right.
Which car are we all chasin', boy?
Move it! Move it!
Get that piece of junk off of the road.
They went left, boy.
Press that pedal, boy.
Where the hell have they got to?
You goofed, boy.
Nearest bridge is two miles back.
Goddamn! What the...
What's goin' on?
What the hell are you doin' now, boy?
The bridge is "that" way!
You're not thinking of...?
I sure am, boy!
Ever heard of Evel Knievel?
Wowee!
I ain't never done that before!
Neither have I, actually.
Let's go get 'em, boy!
You stay put, boy.
This is "my" department.
Glad to see you boys on the ball!
Sheriff JW Pepper, Louisiana State Police.
Here's my identification.
Law Enforcement Association,
American Legion.
Me and my partner here,
we're on a secret mission.
What the hell you doing?
Give me my wallet back.
Doors.
You can't do this to me.
I want my wallet back.
Take these goddamn bracelets off!
I'm gonna sue ya for false arrest!
Police brutality. I got connections.
I'm gonna get the FBI on your ass!
The CIA!
Goddamn it,
I'm gonna get Henry Kissinger!
Now look at me
when I'm talkin' to ya, boy.
What's the matter?
Ain't none of you seen a plane before?
James? James, are you still there?
Can you hear me?
I think we've stopped.
That is really
all there is to report, sir.
So, if I heard correctly,
Scaramanga got away.
Yes, sir.
- In a car that sprouted wings.
- That's perfectly feasible, sir.
- In fact, we're working on one now.
- Oh, Q! Shut up.
- Miss Goodnight was in the boot?
- Yes, sir.
We found the car-plane abandoned
about 200 miles west of Bangkok.
- And the solex?
- In Goodnight's handbag, sir.
- Where's Goodnight now?
- We don't know, sir.
Communications aren't getting the signal
from the homer she has supplied by Q.
Rubbish! They're simply
not stepping up the reception to enable...
Oh, shut up, Q!
Of all the fouled-up,
half-witted operations!
- What do you want?
- We've picked up Goodnight's signal, sir.
- Well, that's something.
- But there's something rather curious, sir.
Our sector's here,
and we're receiving her signal
from somewhere off this coastline here.
Now here it is on a much larger scale.
That's where she is.
In this group of small islands.
That's all we need! Red Chinese waters.
We could stray
inadvertently into them, sir.
- I could fly low under their radar screen.
- Absolutely out of the question.
If the PM gets to hear of this,
he'll hang me from the yardarm.
Officially you won't know
a thing about it, sir.
There's a small seaplane
approaching your island.
Do you want us to take action?
No. No, please don't do anything.
Yes, it's a...
guest I'm expecting.
No, he won't be leaving.
Bonjour, Monsieur Bond.
I am Nick Nack.
Dom Prignon soixante-quatre.
I prefer the '62 myself.
Still, beats a bag of peanuts.
Monsieur Scaramanga
will welcome you personally.
Forgive me, Mr Bond.
A vulgar display, but I couldn't resist it
because I am so delighted
to see you again.
A harmless toy.
I am, as you can see now,
completely unarmed.
Cigarette?
We have so much in common
and so much to discuss.
We will never have this chance again.
Ours is the loneliest profession, so let us
spend a few pleasant hours together.
How can I refuse
such a gracious invitation?
Splendid. Splendid!
Nick Nack, I expect you to surpass
yourself. He's a cordon bleu, you know?
By the way, where's Miss Goodnight?
Oh, she's around here somewhere.
She can't leave,
so she does as she pleases.
How do you like my island?
A bit off the beaten track.
It's rent-free.
I do my landlords an occasional favour.
A cosy arrangement.
- Servant problem, I suppose?
- Not at all.
Nick Nack does for me very nicely.
Usually there's just us two,
but guests are no inconvenience.
We're entirely self-supporting. We have
every electrical device you can think of.
This is an airlock,
as you are doubtless aware.
Automatic, of course.
Naturally, we have an ample supply
of electricity here.
Let me show you.
This should run
a few electric toothbrushes.
Up here.
A solar-energy station.
So this is what it's all about. Ah!
Thermoelectric generators
to convert solar energy into electricity.
All built by Hai Fat's
construction company, no doubt.
Somehow I seem to have inherited it
from him. It's all fully automated.
Kra looks after maintenance and security
in here. Nick Nack does everything else.
They tell me the electricity
is stored in here... somewhere.
Science was never my strong point.
Superconductivity coils
cooled by liquid helium.
If I were you, I wouldn't stick my finger -
or anything else, for that matter - in there.
At 453% below zero, that liquid helium
would break it off like an icicle.
You really know
far more about it than I do.
I'm arranging for countries that can afford
the price to send experts here to see this.
But no solex
until the money is in the bank, right?
Right.
- I have run across similar situations.
- Not what I've got here.
This way the highest bidder
can build hundreds of stations
and sell franchises for hundreds more.
He will literally have the sun in his pocket.
A monopoly on solar power.
The oil sheikhs will pay you
just to keep solar energy "off" the market.
The thought had occurred to me.
This is the collection point.
Ah! So that's where it belongs.
Our famous solex in the still down there
transmits heat to the thermal generators.
It's collected through this?
But where is it collected from?
You need the sun.
Watch that mushroom-shaped rock.
Ingenious, isn't it?
The panels lock on to the sun,
then track it automatically.
Something like that, yes.
Ah. Reflected through this, those panels
must produce a heat of at least 3,500%F.
If you say so, Mr Bond.
But I do know we can focus the power
wherever we want. Here, I'll show you.
This is a bonus.
Goes with the solex. No extra charge.
This is the part I really like.
Now that's what I call solar power.
That's what I call trouble.
You must admit I am now undeniably
the Man with the Golden Gun.
Lunch.
This way, Mr Bond.
Ah, Miss Goodnight!
- James!
- Aren't we a little overdressed?
I like a girl in a bikini.
No concealed weapons.
Miss Goodnight, please. Mr Bond.
Let's see what Nick Nack has for us.
Ah, mushrooms.
The fried mushroom
looks terribly interesting.
Yes, I'd noticed that.
I'll get around to it later.
- Having fun in the sun, Goodnight?
- Yes!
I could stay here for ever.
Mm, excellent.
- Slightly reminiscent of a '34 Mouton.
- Then I must add it to my cellar.
You live well, Scaramanga.
At a million dollars a contract,
I can afford to, Mr Bond.
You work for peanuts. A "well done" from
the Queen and a pittance of a pension.
Apart from that, we are the same.
To us, Mr Bond. We are the best.
There's a useful four-letter word,
and you're full of it.
When I kill it's under specific orders
of my government.
And those I kill are themselves killers.
Come, come, Mr Bond.
You disappoint me.
You get as much fulfilment
out of killing as I do. Admit it.
- I admit killing you would be a pleasure.
- You should have done that before.
But then the English don't think
it's sporting to kill in cold blood.
Don't count on that.
I could have shot you when you landed,
but that would have been too easy.
You see, Mr Bond,
like every great artist, I want to create
an indisputable masterpiece
once in my lifetime.
The death of 007, "mano a mano",
face to face,
will be mine.
You mean stuffed and displayed
over your rocky mantelpiece.
That's an amusing idea,
but I was thinking in terms of history.
A duel between titans.
My golden gun against your Walther PPK.
Each of us with a 50-50 chance.
Six bullets to your one?
I only need one.
Sounds a bit old-fashioned, doesn't it?
I mean, pistols at dawn, that sort of thing.
Indeed it is, Mr Bond.
But it still remains
the only "true" test for gentlemen.
I doubt if you qualify on that score.
However, I accept.
As soon as I have finished this delicious
lunch that Nick Nack has prepared for us.
"Messieurs", I will remind you,
this is "un duel la mort".
Only one of you
can leave the field of honour.
If a "coup de grce" is necessary,
as your referee, I will administer it myself.
I do not expect wounds, only a clean kill.
each contestant will take 20 paces.
Are you ready, Monsieur Scaramanga?
- Ready.
- Are you ready, Monsieur Bond?
- Ready.
- I will now begin the count.
One, two,
three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen,
seventeen, eighteen,
nineteen, twenty!
If you kill him,
all this be mine.
This way, Monsieur Bond.
- Monsieur, good shooting.
- I've never killed a midget before.
But there can always be a first time.
Oh, monsieur!
You only have three bullets left.
I have fooled you.
- Goodnight!
- James!
Oh, James!
Steady, Goodnight.
Where is he?
Flat on his "coup de grce".
Come on, let's get out of this fun palace
and find that solex.
Wait here.
I'll take care of the maintenance man.
I already did.
I laid him out cold.
- You did?
- Yes.
There's more to you than meets the eye.
I hate to ask stupid questions, but
where exactly did you knock him cold?
He landed in that one.
Don't you believe in signs?
We've got five minutes before his body
temperature raises the helium above zero.
Then this whole damn place
will go sky-high.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Kill the beam!
- Hit the master override switch!
- The what?
- Goodnight?
- Yes, James?
Now listen carefully.
There's a console up there.
Now, there must be a scanner
interlock button on it. Push it!
Are you still there?
It'll be on the auxiliary feedback circuit.
"Computer interlock..." Is that it?
Just push every damn button, will you?
Good girl, Goodnight. You've done it.
Oh, I have.
Goodnight, get the hell out of there!
I've done it.
- I hope you can swim, Goodnight.
- This way.
His junk is moored around the corner.
- But, darling, who is at the wheel?
- George.
George?
Automatic pilot.
We should make Hong Kong
in about... eight hours.
Give or... take a little.
I always wanted to take
a slow boat "from" China.
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you!
Why, you...!
Hey! Let me out!
Hey, what are you doing?
Ouch!
No, no, no! I can't breathe!
Ow! You'll be sorry.
I may be small, but I never forget.
I kill you if you don't let me out of here!
Ow! Let me out, you big bully!
Shut up.
- What did you do with him?
- What do you think?
- Oh, James, you didn't!
- Yes, I damn well did.
Got all the glass out of the bed, I trust?
We don't want anything else
to disturb our peace,
do we?
Now, where were we?
Oh, James!
Mmm...
What's the matter?
Something came up.
Hello?
Ah, there you are, Bond.
Well done. Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.
I'd like a word with her.
Hold on, sir.
Bond? Bond, are you there?
Goodnight?
She's just coming, sir.
Goodnight?
Goodnight?
- Goodnight!
- Good night, sir.
# Good night, good night
# Sleep well, my dear
# No need to fear
# James Bond is here
# whenever he's hired
# It comes just before the kill
# No one can catch him
# No hit man can match him
# For his million-dollar skill
# means another poor victim
# Has come to a glittering end
# If you want to get rid of someone
# The Man with the Golden Gun
# Will get it done
# He'll shoot anyone
# With his golden gun

Captain wants you to keep 500ft.
Manoeuvring, Control.
Come in shallow to 500ft.
- Keep 500ft.
- Keep 500ft, sir.
What the hell's going on, Eddie?
Emergency stations. Emergency stations.
Captain to the control room.
- What the hell's going on?
- Control, Manoeuvring.
- Control.
- I'm losing electrical frequency.
- I'll have to break down the system
- Control, Sound Room.
Total loss of power on all sonar sets.
Surface. Blow forward, blow aft. Rise on
both planes. Raise the search periscope.
Oh, my God!
Put him through.
Good morning, sir.
No, First Sea Lord. No, there's been
no contact with Ranger yet, sir.
No. No sightings, no distress signals, sir.
It looks very much like it.
Yes. Yes, of course I will, sir.
We've lost one of our nuclear submarines.
What?
The submarine Potemkin
disappeared without trace?
But what a catastrophe,
Comrade Chairman.
Yes, of course.
I will assign our best agent immediately.
Rube/vitch, where is Agent Triple X?
On leave, General. At the People's
Rest and Recuperation Centre.
It's been a wonderful weekend.
- I shall never forget it.
- Nor will I.
When can we meet again?
As soon as my mission is accomplished.
I must go. I have to be in Austria tonight.
Five more minutes.
Agent Triple X
Calling Agent Triple X You will report
to headquarters immediately.
Agent Triple X, acknowledge and verify.
This is Triple X.
Message received and understood.
Yes, Mr Prime Minister.
I understand the gravity of the situation.
Yes, I'll put our best man on it at once.
Goodbye.
Moneypenny, where's 007?
He's on a mission, sir. In Austria.
Tell him to pull out. Immediately.
Oh, James.
I cannot find the words.
Let me try and enlarge your vocabulary.
- What happened? Where are you going?
- Sorry. Something came up.
But, James, I need you.
So does England.
He has just left.
He has just left- Over and out.
Message received.
We are waiting. Over and out.
Now.
Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it
Half as good as you
Baby, you're the best
I wasn't Iookin'
But somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me
The spy who loved me
ls keepin' all my secrets safe tonight
And nobody does it better
Though sometimes
I wish someone could
Nobody does it
Quite the way you do
Why'd you have to be so good?
The way that you hold me
Whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from runnin'
But just keep it comin'
How'd you learn
to do the things you do?
And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it
Half as good as you
Baby, baby
Baby, you're the best
Send in Agent Triple X.
You sent for me, Comrade General.
Good morning. Major Amasova,
we are facing a most delicate situation.
Our nuclear submarine
Potemkin has disappeared.
- Sabotage?
- That is for you to find out.
We have one lead. A connection in Cairo.
You leave tonight.
Will that be all, Comrade General?
There is one more thing.
I regret to inform you, Major,
that Agent Sergei Barsov has been killed.
On a mission,
at Berngarten in the Austrian Alps.
- A tragic occurrence, Comrade General.
- It had not escaped our notice
that you had been more than friends
for some time. I'm very sorry.
- How did he die?
- We haven't all the details yet,
but it appears he'd become involved
in a British Secret Service operation.
Please keep me informed,
Comrade General.
I should very much like to meet
whoever was responsible for his death.
Sea King 05, finals to land. Over.
Sea King 05, this is Faslane.
Sea King 05. Roger. Out.
Good morning, sir.
- Morning, 007.
- Hello, Q.
- Mission successful?
- On and off.
Morning, Commander.
- Captain Forsyth.
- Commander.
Commander Bond, sir.
Mr Frederick Gray, Minister of Defence.
Morning, Commander.
Admiral Hargreaves,
Flag Officer Submarines.
- Ark Royal, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.
- I believe M told you about this.
- Yes, Minister.
Over here, please, gentlemen.
This is Ranger's prearranged course
to her patrol area?
That's right.
- Who knew this course?
- Admiral Hargreaves, myself,
and Talbot, the captain of the submarine.
Good God!
- Where did this come from?
- For the moment that's top secret.
I see, sir.
This means the Russians can track our
submarines underwater and sink them.
- I believe it does.
- How could they? It's impossible.
No. It's quite simple, really.
Heat-signature recognition most likely.
- With your permission, Minister?
- Yes, of course.
We already know that satellites
with infrared heat sensors
can detect a nuclear missile in flight
by its tail fire.
- Well?
- Someone can now locate
a submerged nuclear submarine
in exactly the same way, by its wake.
But that means they can totally
undermine our Western defence strategy.
It looks like it, yes.
- Where did we get the tracing, Freddie?
- Cairo. Diplomatic bag.
Somebody got hold of the plans of that
tracking system and is trying to sell them.
They sent us that tracing
as proof that it's genuine.
If there is a deal to be made,
the price is going to be high.
High? Astronomical.
That missing submarine
had 16 Polaris missiles aboard.
- I take it we have a contact in Egypt?
- M will give you the details.
You leave tonight.
- Dr Bechmann and Professor Markovitz.
- Thank you.
Well, gentlemen, now that the moment
has come to bid you farewell,
I congratulate both you,
Doctor, and you, Professor,
on your brilliant work
in the development
of the submarine tracking system.
Thanks primarily to you, I'm happy to say
that the first phase of our operation
has met with considerable success.
I have instructed my assistant to have
paid into your Swiss bank account
the sum of ten million dollars each.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you indeed.
And that, I think, concludes our business.
Before you go, however,
I very much regret to inform you
that a dangerous development has
recently been brought to my notice.
Someone has been attempting to sell
the plans of our tracking project
to competing world powers.
Someone intimately associated
with the project.
My dear, it would perhaps be
more seemly if you were to leave us.
Thank you.
It was you who betrayed me.
You had access to all the information.
And now you will pay the penalty.
Once again, gentlemen,
my most profound thanks.
- Sandor.
- Yes, sir.
Jaws.
I'm assigning you the task
of recovering the microfilm copy
of the tracking system.
Sandor, you will go with him. Obey him.
Every person who even comes
into contact with that microfilm
is to be eliminated.
Stand by for helicopter takeoff.
A/I personnel clear
of the flight-deck platform.
Cancel transfer of 20 million dollars.
Inform next of kin that a tragic accident
has resulted in the deaths of
Professor Markovitz and Dr Bechmann.
The funeral was at sea.
- Fade! Kadeer.
- Garabna-
Sh ukran
- Shukran.
- Afwan.
- Assalaam alaykum.
- Ala ykum assalaam.
May the peace of Allah descend upon this
abode and allow a poor traveller to enter.
May the hospitality of these miserable
quarters be sufficient to your needs.
James Bond! What a delightful surprise
after all these years. Do sit down.
Thank you.
I wondered what you were going to do
when you went down from Cambridge.
I never had any problems knowing what
you were going to do, Hosein. Shukran.
We don't only have oil, you know.
What can I offer you?
Sheep's eyes, dates? Vodka martini?
Information. Who is putting the submarine
tracking system on the market?
What a pity it is you persist
in being so businesslike.
The gentleman you will eventually
be dealing with is a certain Max Kalba.
- Eventually?
- To reach Kalba,
you must first make contact
with a man called Fekkesh, Aziz Fekkesh.
I'll give you the address of his apartment
in Cairo, but it's too late to meet today.
Can I persuade you
to accept a bed for the night?
It's kind of you, Hosein, but
I really feel I...
Are you quite sure
I can't persuade you to stay the night?
When one is in Egypt, one should
delve deeply into its treasures.
Mr Bond.
Yes. I'm sorry. The door was open.
Mr Fekkesh is expecting me.
I phoned him.
He asked me to give you a message.
He will be a little late.
May I ask where he is?
Mr Fekkesh asked me to entertain you
while you are waiting.
Really?
Where is Fekkesh?
- You are very suspicious, Mr Bond.
- I find I live much longer that way.
Now, where is he?
If there's anything you would like...
Anything at all...
I had lunch, but...
I seem to have missed dessert.
As urgent as my appointment is,
I'd hate him to walk in and surprise us.
There is no danger of that.
- He's gonna be some time, then, is he?
- Mm-hm.
Is he meeting someone?
I'm sorry. I cannot answer that question.
I think you can.
No!
Where's Fekkesh?
- Where's Fekkesh?
- Pyramids.
Agh!
What a helpful chap.
You have come tonight
to the most fabulous
and celebrated place in the world.
Here on the plateau of Giza
stands for ever the mightiest
of human achievements.
No traveller, emperor, merchant or poet
has trodden on these sands
and not gasped in awe.
The curtain of night is about to rise
and disclose the stage on which
the drama of a civilisation took place.
Those involved have been present
since the dawn of history,
pitched stubbornly
against sand and wind.
And the voice of the desert
has crossed the centuries.
Excuse me, Major.
I'll be back in a moment.
With each new dawn, I see the sun god
rise on the far bank of the Nile.
I am the faithful warden
at the foot of his Lord,
so faithful, so vigilant,
so near him
that he gave me his face for my own.
I am a Pharaoh's companion,
and I am he, the Pharaoh.
This is the tomb of Cheops,
Pharaoh of the fourth dynasty
4,500 years ago.
Here is the great pyramid which he built
to defend himself against death.
Here in the depths of this tomb
a servant of the king awaits the call
to set out upon his journey into eternity.
Death lies waiting.
- Where is Fekkesh?
- With the Pharaohs.
- You killed him.
- No, he was dead when I found him.
Hope you enjoyed the show. Good night.
What an unexpected pleasure.
Welcome to the Mujaba Club.
Buy you a drink, Major Amasova?
Or may I call you Triple X?
So you know who I am.
You made quite an impression.
I'm sorry about Ivan and Boris.
- They exceeded their orders.
- Good staff is hard to find these days.
- Yes, sir?
- The lady'll have a Bacardi on the rocks.
For the gentleman,
vodka martini, shaken not stirred.
Touch.
Commander James Bond,
recruited to the British
Secret Service from the Royal Navy.
Licensed to kill,
and has done so on numerous occasions.
Many lady friends, but married only once.
- Wife killed...
- All right, you've made your point.
- You're sensitive, Mr Bond.
- About certain things, yes.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
tragically, I have a previous engagement.
Happily enough, so do I.
- Goodbye, Mr Bond.
- Let's say au revoir.
I have the oddest feeling
we'll be meeting again sometime.
- I'm looking for a Mr Kalba.
- Mr Max Kalba is the owner of the club.
Over there.
Mr Kalba,
my name is Bond, James Bond.
What of it?
You had an appointment
with a Mr Fekkesh.
Well?
He won't be joining you.
- You have something I might like to buy.
- Just a moment.
I would like to bid for it, too.
You forgot your drink, Mr Bond.
Thank you. Na zdoroviye.
It seems you have competition,
Mr Bond,
and from where I sit, I fancy you will find
the lady's figure hard to match.
Might the contestants at least be
permitted to view the article for sale?
Well, now, who will start the bidding?
Mr Kalba, sir.
The telephone. An urgent call.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
This is Kalba.
AII6 ? A/I6?
Another?
We've really got to stop meeting like this.
Kalba was called to the phone.
What happened?
He was cutoff... Permanently.
The microfilm. Where is it?
Search me.
He must have it, or you wouldn't be here.
You don't know who he is.
He's on our records. A professional killer.
Called Jaws? Make no mistake, Mr Bond.
I want that microfilm
and I'm going to get it.
Unless I get it first.
Watch out!
Don't move.
The microfilm. Give it to me.
Egyptian builders.
Sorry.
You're just too late.
Give me the key.
The key!
Give it to me.
The key!
Try the big one.
Can you play any other tune?
Let's try reverse. That's backwards.
Would you like me to drive?
- Women drivers.
- Quiet! Watch this.
Shaken, but not stirred.
That gorilla must have
his teeth fixed by a riveter.
By the way,
thanks for deserting me back there.
Every woman for herself, remember?
Still, you... You did save my life.
We all make mistakes, Mr Bond.
The cylinder-head gasket.
Oh.
Hey! Stanna!
Stanna!
- Khuddnf Iii Kaa Hira
- Aywa, tfadal.
- What did he say?
- He thinks we're overdressed,
- but he'll take us to Cairo.
- Good.
It's getting cold.
Is there
anything I can do to warm you up?
You don't have to worry about me,
Mr Bond.
I went on a survival course in Siberia.
Yes, I believe a great number
of your countrymen do.
- What did they teach you?
- That it's very important
to have a positive mental attitude.
Nothing more practical than that?
Food is also very important.
What else?
When necessary, shared bodily warmth.
That's the part I like.
- Is this really what they do in Siberia?
- Yes, but not how they do it.
You're not trying to take advantage of me,
are you?
The thought never crossed my mind.
Just when it was getting interesting.
Where's the girl?
- Fein el bent?
- El bent, enta w'nayem rahet.
Morning, Moneypenny. Is he in?
Uh-huh.
My, it must have been quite a party.
Boring, Moneypenny.
As a matter of fact, I dropped off.
- Hello, James. We've been expecting you.
- Good morning, sir.
There's been a change of plan.
You probably recognise my opposite
number in the KGB. General Gogol.
And I believe you're familiar
with Major Amasova.
Enough to know
which cigarettes she smokes.
Our respective governments
have agreed to pool their resources
to find out what happened
to our submarines.
We have entered a new era
of Anglo-Soviet cooperation.
And as a sign of Russian good faith,
I'm prepared to make available the
microfilm recovered by Agent Triple X.
With considerable ease, I might add.
Don't bother with it. It's useless.
I examined it on the boat.
I assure you it is quite genuine.
Except that the vital technical information
has been taken out.
This was only intended
to whet our appetites.
Maybe Q can make something out of it.
I want that ready for Ahmed's tea party.
- After you, Alexis.
- No, no. After you, Miles.
Thank you.
That could bring tears to your eyes.
Everybody ready? Right.
Now, we're pretty certain that
this drawing was drafted in Italy.
The size corresponds
with a Venetian octavo,
and the typeface is an Italian one.
Now, note the slight upward stress
on the transversals.
Q, what's that mark there?
Probably something the drawing was
resting on when it was photographed.
Must have been done in a hurry.
- Can you enlarge it?
- Mm. Wait a minute.
Oratory. What is that?
- It's another word for chapel.
- Looks a bit like a bishop's mitre.
It is a fish. That is the symbol
of the Stromberg shipping line.
Karl Stromberg is one of
the richest men in the world.
One of the principal capitalist
exploiters of the West, sir.
It's not oratory, it's laboratory. Stromberg
has a marine research laboratory.
On Corsica, I believe.
Well done, James.
Actually, sir, it is in Sardegna.
That's brilliant. I'm certain
that two such perceptive talents
will enjoy working together in Sardinia,
and that it will help to make
Anglo-Soviet cooperation a reality.
Here we are.
That was a delicious meal. Thank you.
I didn't realise
you had such a healthy appetite.
Neither did I. It must be
travelling by train. I always enjoy it.
I remember when...
- What do you remember?
- I was going to talk about a mission.
Silly, isn't it? We can't talk
and yet we're in the same business.
- But with rival companies.
- We're not rivals at the moment.
No.
Then... How about a nightcap
on the company? My company.
I'm very sorry. I have an idea tomorrow's
going to be a busy day. I must sleep.
Yes. Well, then, sleep well.
And you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
What happened?
He just dropped in for a quick bite.
You're hurt.
Later.
Let's worry about you.
What was it they taught you
on that survival course?
A positive mental attitude.
And shared bodily warmth.
Nothing about keeping out of draughts.
Still enjoy travelling by train?
You saved my life.
Thank you, James.
I'm sorry.
Why don't you lie down
and let me look at it?
What can we use for a bandage?
How about this?
Grazie.
Wait a moment.
- Good morning, Major Boothroyd.
- Morning.
Look what Q's brought for us.
Isn't it nice?
Right, pay attention, O07. I want you
to take great care of this equipment.
- There are one or two accessories...
- Q, have I ever let you down?
Frequently.
- Buongiorno.
- Buongiorno, signore e signora.
You have a reservation for me. Sterling.
Ah, yes. Mr and Mrs Sterling.
Booked from Cairo.
- That's right.
- We have suite A5 for you.
A sitting room... And two bedrooms.
Moneypenny being a little over-efficient.
Do you have any messages for me?
Thank you.
Excellent.
We have been granted an audience.
- Mr Sterling?
- Yes.
I'm Naomi.
Mr Stromberg sent me to collect you.
How do you do? This is my wife,
who also happens to be my assistant.
- You are on holiday here?
- Where there's an ocean,
a marine biologist is never on holiday.
Can we offer you a drink before we go?
No, thank you. Mr Stromberg's
a very busy man. His time is precious.
What a handsome craft. Such lovely lines.
Thank you.
Very impressive.
I wonder if you'd show my wife around
while I'm with Mr Stromberg.
- Of course. This way.
- Thank you.
Now, don't be a bother to Naomi, darling.
I'll be back soon.
Oh, by the way,
Mr Stromberg prefers not to shake hands.
- It's the third button.
- Thank you.
Why do we seek to conquer space,
when seven-tenths of our universe
remains to be explored?
The world beneath the sea.
You seem to be well-equipped
to repair that oversight, Mr Stromberg.
My name is Sterling, Robert Sterling.
It's very kind of you to receive me.
Not at all. It's always a pleasure to
welcome someone with a mutual interest.
An extraordinary number of rare species.
You recognise that variety, of course.
Of course.
Pterois volitans. Other fish avoid it.
Those dorsal spines
are laden with venom.
Handsome but deadly.
I see you know your subject, Mr Sterling.
One tries. You have a remarkable
establishment here, Mr Stromberg.
I'm somewhat of a recluse.
I wish to conduct my life
on my own terms
and in surroundings
with which I can identify.
That is a privilege of wealth.
Don't you miss the outside world?
For me, this is all the world.
There is beauty,
there is ugliness,
and there is death.
I think you will find
this interesting, Mr Sterling.
- An underwater city.
- Fascinating, isn't it?
- The only hope for the future of mankind.
- We all have our dreams.
No dream, Mr Sterling. Soon a reality.
I'm afraid you must excuse me.
I have business to attend to.
Goodbye, Mr Sterling.
And if we don't meet again,
I wish you luck with your research.
Thank you. The brief glimpse
you've afforded me today
will only encourage me
to redouble my efforts.
Goodbye, Mr Stromberg.
- How interesting.
- There you are.
Darling, you should look at this model.
It's beautiful.
This is the Liparus, the latest
addition to the Stromberg fleet,
launched nine months ago.
Over a million tons,
it's the largest tanker in the world.
After the Karl Marx, of course.
Really, darling? It's amazing
the items of information you store away.
Were they the two on the train?
James Bond.
And the woman is Major Amasova,
a Russian agent.
Let them get ashore
and then kill them.
You're being secretive.
Where are we going?
I want another look
at that Stromberg laboratory.
Could he operate
the tracking system from there?
It's possible. All we know for sure is
that two nuclear submarines are missing.
What did you think of the model?
There was something strange about the
design of her bows. M's checking her out.
- James, that motorcycle...
- Has been following us for the last mile.
All those feathers and he still can't fly.
- James, there's...
- I know. Don't tell me.
Mamma mia! Che successo?
Oddio, tutto distrutto!
Do you ever get the feeling
somebody doesn't like you?
Can you swim?
It's time we said goodbye
to an uninvited guest.
Alone at last.
That's what we've come to look at.
James!
Brace yourself.
Look!
How did you know about that?
I stole the blueprints of this car
two years ago.
Can we make it?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- I have a message for you.
- I think you just delivered it.
Thank you.
Sorry to interrupt you,
but I asked M for a list of all the ports
- the Stromberg tanker had called at.
- And what is the answer?
Since she was fitted out, there is no
record of her putting into port anywhere.
That's very odd
if it's true.
We don't make mistakes of that sort.
You sound just like a Russian.
I think we should take a closer look
at that tanker, don't you?
Yes, I do.
- Shall I contact Gogol?
- There's no need.
M has already offered to fix it.
- Very nice.
- It's Austrian. I bought it in Berngarten.
- Berngarten?
- Yes, I was doing some skiing.
- When was this?
- About three weeks ago. Why?
Do you recognise him?
No. Who is he?
The man I loved.
He was in Berngarten three weeks ago.
Did you kill him?
When someone's behind you on skis
trying to put a bullet in your back,
you don't always have time
to remember a face.
In our business, Anya, people get killed.
We both know that. So did he.
It was either him or me.
The answer to the question is yes.
I did kill him.
Then when this mission is over,
I will kill you.
Come in.
- Commander Carter?
- That's right. Welcome aboard. Major.
Have a seat.
- Can I get you something?
- Not for me. I don't know about the major.
Maj...
I'm sorry.
I hadn't expected you to be a woman.
Aboard this vessel, Commander,
I am Major Amasova of the Russian army.
- Yeah, sure.
- It's good of you to help us out.
- Got a couple of cabins at your disposal.
- Thank you.
Major, you're welcome
to use the shower in my quarters.
You do not have to show me
any special favours, Commander.
All the same,
I think it might be better if I did.
From COMSUB Atlantic, sir.
Right.
What's the matter, sailor? You never seen
a major taking a shower before?
Stand by for
second observation on target.
Up scope.
Check.
Target bearing. Mark.
Range. Mark.
Down scope.
- One division in high power.
- Range, 6,200 yards, sir.
- Angle on the bow, port 50.
- Torpedo Room. Boarding party ready.
Captain, sir. Our best solution
for the target is 120, speed three knots.
Officer of the deck, come right north. Tell
Manoeuvring to make turns for 11 knots.
Which bullet has my name on it,
the first or the last?
I have never failed on a mission,
Commander. Any mission.
In that case, Major,
one of us is bound to end up gravely
disappointed, because neither have I...
Control, Manoeuvring.
We're losing electrical frequency.
Control, Sonar.
Total power supplies failure.
Surface. Blow forward. Blow aft.
Up scope. Stand by.
Where the hell is she?
My God. She's right behind us.
Impossible.
Stand by at Number Two Dock.
Stand by at Number Two Dock.
Containment Crews, take up positions.
Dock Officer to Operations.
Mobilisation Crew entering dock area.
Number Two Dock to Operations.
25m to run.
I say again, 25m to run.
Activate Number Two Dock.
Operations Room, Number Two Dock.
Docking now complete.
Disembarkation Crew
moving into position.
S-ra y programme completed. Magnetic
field shut down. All systems normal.
Limpet speaker in position, sir.
Commander, you have precisely
two minutes to open your hatches
and surrender your ship.
The alternative is extermination
by cyanide gas.
Well?
There's no alternative.
Now, hear this. Your captain speaking.
Open all hatches
and proceed quietly onto the casing.
Hurry, Commander!
I'm not renowned for my patience!
OK, two ranks! Move it out!
Stay close to me. We'll try and hide you.
Our time is limited, Captain.
- Commence operations forthwith.
- Yes, sir.
Attention all personnel.
Stromberg Crews One and Two,
embark your submarines.
Put the Americans
in with the others, Captain.
Remove the prisoners.
Don't look up. You're on Candid Camera.
Complete nuclear missile loading.
Operations, Bridge. Altering course
number to 340, coming up to six knots.
Operations, Engine Room.
Revolutions 96 set.
Anya!
Operations, Radar.
No contacts within 25, 00om.
Bring those two prisoners here.
Operations Room, Sonar.
No contacts, no transmissions.
James Bond and Major Amasova.
You have certainly been persistent.
Very well.
Now your curiosity can be satisfied.
Both crews aboard, sir.
Missile onload completed.
They have already
been given their targets.
At 12 noon
they will have reached firing positions.
Within minutes, New York and Moscow
will cease to exist.
Global destruction will follow.
The new era will begin.
Submarines One and Two,
commence departure drill.
All right, Stromberg. You've made
your point. How much do you want?
How much?
Whatever do you mean, Mr Bond?
The price for not firing
those nuclear missiles.
You're deluded, Mr Bond.
I'm not interested in extortion.
I intend to change the face of history.
- By destroying the world?
- By creating a world.
A new and beautiful world
beneath the sea.
Today civilisation as we know it
is corrupt and decadent.
Inevitably, it will destroy itself.
I'm merely accelerating the process.
That does notjustify mass murder.
For that, Major,
I will accept the judgment of posterity.
Submarines ready for departure, sir.
Open bow doors, Captain.
Stromberg One,
you are clear to proceed to sea.
Stromberg Two,
you are also clear to proceed to sea.
Observe, Mr Bond.
The instruments of Armageddon.
Put this man
with the rest of the prisoners.
No, no, no, no. The lady will be
travelling to Atlantis with me.
Farewell, Mr Bond.
That word has, I must admit,
a welcome ring of permanency about it.
Au revoir, Anya.
Bring her.
Get that man at all costs!
Keep going.
Call him over.
Hey!
- Where's your captain?
- Here.
- Release the crews. Go to the armoury.
- Follow me, men.
Come on! Let's go!
Seal the operations room.
You! Stand by over there!
Help yourselves to firearms!
Grab a weapon! Come on, let's go!
We've taken both sides of the lower dock
area, but I'm afraid your captain's dead.
We're still no closer to that control room.
Leave it to me, sir.
Andrews, James, Marshall, Purvis!
Follow me!
That armour plating is inches thick.
We'll never get through it.
- Let's get to the armoury.
- What's there?
- A nuclear missile.
- A nuc...? Hey, wait!
This could take hours, sir.
- You got a date?
- No, sir.
Now you are beautiful.
I'm sorry if you feel less than comfortable.
But you have a tendency to violence
that has to be controlled.
- What is it?
- I, uh... Have to report, sir,
a break-out by some of the prisoners.
That is unfortunate, Captain.
However, we now have
the situation under control.
The operations room
is quite impregnable.
Then we must hope, Captain,
that you will suffer no further mishap.
OK.
All I need is the detonator.
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?
There has to be a first time for everything.
Blast!
What's the problem?
I mustn't touch
the impulse conductor circuit.
This ring houses
the impulse conductor circuit.
It's magnetic. I mustn't touch it
with any part of the detonator.
- What happens if you do?
- It'll go off.
- Give me a number six detonator.
- Aye aye, sir.
Number six, sir.
Thank you.
Did you fix that 20-second fuse?
Yes, sir. Here it is.
- Plastic explosive.
- Plastic explosive.
- Is it proceeding according to plan?
- Yes, sir.
Excellent.
- Sir!
- What is it?
The monitor's faded.
Change the circuit.
Cease fi re!
You're too late, Bond.
Our submarines are already on station.
In four minutes
the missiles will be launched.
- The transmission unit, can you work it?
- Sure. But we've only got three minutes!
If we find the position of the submarines,
maybe we can reprogramme them.
- To do what?
- To destroy each other.
James! The globe!
Take the position of the first submarine
and pass it on to the second as her target.
- And vice versa.
- Exactly.
Missile Control, this is the captain.
We have a change of target.
New coordinates are 034285219.
Missile Control. Captain.
We have a new target.
Everybody back on board the submarine!
Pass it on! Come on! Let's go!
Come on!
Foster, get those lines cleared! Come on!
Leaver, throw those guys a line!
Get those fenders cleared!
Fon/vard and aft!
- Get the submarine at diving stations!
- Diving stations!
Manoeuvring. Reactor into half-power
state. Ready to check telegraphs.
All personnel, take up positions fast!
Get Roberts to the gyro unit.
Come on! Move it!
- Stand by to revert to normal lighting.
- Come on. Get that hatch shut. Quick.
Torpedo Room, Control.
Load tube one with Mark 46 torpedo.
Open outer door on tube one.
- Select zero gyro angle.
- Select zero gyro angle.
- Outer door on tube one open.

- Left seven degrees rudder.
- Left seven degrees rudder.
How far would you say?
Mm. About 10,000 yards, sir.
Commander.
Close it.
I got this signal from the Pentagon.
"On instructions from the Security
Council, destroy Atlantis fast."
- What does fast mean?
- Battle stations five minutes.
With torpedoes?
Yes.
- He has Anya on there.
- I know, James. I'm sorry.
- I have to get her off.
- How?
The equipment Q sent for me.
Can I have it?
Sure.
Barton. That package for
Commander Bond, bring it in quick.
- I need an hour.
- That comes from the top!
40 minutes.
You're gonna get me court-martialled.
OK. One hour.
Come in.
Here, I'll give you a hand.
Good evening, Mr Bond.
I've been expecting you.
Stay where you are.
I'll send the elevator down for you.
Goodbye, Mr Bond.
You did want me to drop in.
- Where's Anya?
- Well, well, well.
A British agent in love with
a Russian agent. Dtente indeed.
Sit down, Mr Bond.
Your time's running out, Stromberg.
Yours too, Mr Bond. Yours too.
And faster than you think.
You've shot your bolt, Stromberg.
Now it's my turn.
How does that grab you?
We're five minutes overdue, Captain.
James! Stromberg?
Dead. So are we
unless we get out of here fast.
Match bearings and shoot.
Ah. Maybe I misjudged Stromberg.
Any man who drinks Dom Prignon '52
can't be all bad.
- The mission is over, Commander.
- Mm?
In my country the condemned man
is usually allowed a final request.
Granted.
Let's get out of these wet things.
But, James,
- what would our superiors say?
- They're never going to know.
Lower the stern gate.
- ls there a danger of the bends?
- We'll soon find out.
James!
-007!
' Triple x:
Bond, what do you think you're doing?
Keeping the British end up, sir.
Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you're the best
I wasn't Iookin'
But somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me
The spy who loved me
ls keepin' all my secrets safe tonight
And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it
Half as good as you
Baby, baby
Darlin', you're the best
Baby, you're the best
Baby, you're the best
Baby, you're the best
(JAMES BOND THEME PLAYING)
(GUN FIRING)
How we doing, Richard?
We should pass
over the English coast
15 minutes
ahead of time, sir.
Well, with this
load on our back,
that's good going.
Just trust the RAF, sir.
What the hell is that?
The shuttle ignition.
Disappeared?
And what happened
to the Moonraker?
Good God.
Yes, yes, of course, Minister.
Right away.
Moneypenny, is 007 back
from that African job?
He's on his last leg, sir.
Any higher, Mr. Bond,
my ears will pop.
I don't think I'm ever going
to fly with anyone else.
You're so right, Mr. Bond.
This is where we
leave you, Mr. Bond.
A little premature, isn't it?
Enjoy your flight.
(SCREAMING)
(CIRCUS MUSIC PLAYING)
(DRUM ROLL)
(CYMBALS CRASHING)
(MOONRAKER PLAYING)
Where are you?
Why do you hide?
Where is that moonlight trail
That leads to your side?
Just like the Moonraker goes
In search of his dream of gold
I search for love
For someone to have and hold
I've seen your smile
In a thousand dreams
Felt your touch
And it always seems
You love me
Where are you?
When will we meet?
Take my unfinished life
And make it complete
Just like the Moonraker knows
His dream will
come true someday
I know that you
Are only a kiss away
I've seen your smile
In a thousand dreams
Felt your touch
And it always seems
You love me
Good morning, Moneypenny.
James.
But why are you so late?
I fell out of an airplane
without a parachute.
(CHUCKLING)
Who's in there?
Q and the Minister
of Defense.
You don't believe me,
do you?
And you should
go right in.
Yes, Moneypenny.
007. At last.
Good morning, sir.
I think you know
Frederick Gray,
Minister of Defense.
Commander.
Minister. Q.
Moonraker?
What do you know
about Moonraker?
What I read
in the newspaper, sir.
Then you'll know
that Moonraker,
the space shuttle,
was being flown over here
on loan from the Americans
on the back of a 747.
Yes, which crashed
somewhere in the Yukon,
aircraft and shuttle
totally destroyed,
correct?
That's the official version.
The truth is rather
more disturbing,007.
Look at this.
Q: Now, that's
the scene of the crash.
Wreckage strewn
over a large area.
That's all that's
left of the fuselage.
We've been through it
with a fine-toothed comb,
but there's no sign
of Moonraker, not a trace.
Are you suggesting
the shuttle was
hijacked in midair?
That's for you
to find out,007.
The shuttles are
built in California
by Drax Industries.
Yes. We were responsible
for the safety of that
shuttle, Commander.
The United States government
is justifiably concerned.
I can imagine.
Then, California must
be the place to start.
I agree.
Don't make any mistakes,007.
The situation is critical.
We've got to
find that shuttle.
Yes, sir.
If that's all,
gentlemen...
Ah, just a minute,007.
I've got something
for you.
Q: Roll up your
right sleeve, will you?
This is now being issued
as standard equipment.
Strap it on your wrist.
It's activated
by nerve impulses
from the wrist muscles.
Like this?
Oh, thank you,007.
Be careful, will you?
Yes, Q.
Ten darts, five blue-tipped
with armor piercing heads,
five red-tipped,
cyanide coated,
causing death in 30 seconds.
Very novel, Q.
You must get them
in the stores for Christmas.
BOND: Good morning, gentlemen.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Welcome to California,
Mr. Bond.
I like it already.
My name is Corinne Dufour.
Oh, and you're going to be
showing me around, are you,
Corinne?
No. I'm just a humble pilot
in the service of
the Drax Corporation.
This is the Drax estate now.
CORINNE: Everything you see
belongs to Mr. Drax.
Owns a lot, doesn't he?
What he doesn't own,
he doesn't want.
We're approaching
the main complex now.
BOND: That's where
the Moonraker shuttle
is made?
That's right,
workshops, hangars,
design and
experimental blocks,
test centers, everything.
BOND: Very impressive.
I'd heard that
Hugo Drax is obsessed
with the conquest of space.
Now, I can believe it.
(SOFTLY) Good Lord.
The Drax residence.
CORINNE: Every stone
brought from France.
Cute, isn't it?
Magnificent.
Why didn't he buy
the Eiffel Tower as well?
He did, but the French
government refused him
an export permit.
Look there.
Those are
the astronaut trainees.
Mr. Drax is
financing the entire
training program
out of his own pocket.
He seems to have an eye
for a good investment.
Mr. Drax will see Mr. Bond
in the drawing room,
Miss Dufour.
Thank you, Cavendish.
This way, please, sir.
(CLASSICAL PIANO MUSIC
PLAYING)
Mr. Bond, sir.
Mr. Bond.
Mr. Drax.
Allow me to present,
before they leave us,
Countess Lubinski,
Lady Victoria Devon,
Mr. Bond.
How do you do?
Well, my dear fellow,
your reputation
precedes you, of course.
I'm honored that
your government
should send you
on so delicate a mission.
Delicate, Mr. Drax?
Well, to apologize
in person for the loss
of my space shuttle.
How would Oscar Wilde
have put it?
"To lose one aircraft
may be regarded
as a misfortune,
"to lose two seems
like carelessness. "
Well, an apology will be made
to the American government,
Mr. Drax,
when we've discovered
why there was no trace
of the Moonraker
in that wreckage.
DRAX: And your loyalty
commands respect, Mr. Bond.
You have arrived
at a propitious moment,
coincident with your country's
one indisputable contribution
to Western civilization.
Afternoon tea.
May I press you to
a cucumber sandwich?
Thank you, no,
nothing at all.
The shuttle, is it made
entirely here in California?
No. I own a number
of subsidiaries
throughout the world,
producing components.
The conquest of space
represents an investment
in the future of the entire
human race, Mr. Bond.
It is, therefore,
logical to seek out
the best that each
nation has to offer.
Are you referring
to people or skills?
Both, Mr. Bond.
Am I too soon?
Not at all.
I'm sure Mr. Bond
is eager to start his tour.
Miss Dufour will escort you
to Dr. Goodhead
who will show you around.
Ask anything you like.
Thank you for being
so cooperative.
A pleasure.
Look after Mr. Bond.
See that some harm
comes to him.
You'll find Dr. Goodhead
first on the right.
Oh. Thank you for the ride.
Call on me
if you need anything.
(CLEARING THROAT)
Good afternoon.
Can I help you?
Yes. My name is Bond.
James Bond.
I'm looking for Dr. Goodhead.
You just found her.
A woman.
Your powers of observation
do you credit, Mr. Bond.
James, to my friends.
Holly Goodhead.
Are you training
to be an astronaut?
I'm fully trained.
On loan from NASA,
the Space Administration.
Well, Mr. Bond,
I guess we'd
better get started.
You don't want to lose time
as well as a space shuttle,
do you?
This is it,
the Moonraker.
Capable of being launched
into space by rocket...
Orbiting the Earth
and reentering
the atmosphere to land
like any conventional
aircraft.
GOODHEAD: This is
the centrifuge training.
BOND: It simulates
the gravity force you feel
when shot into space.
The speed is controlled by
the instructor from up there.
Why not try it?
Why not?
Strap yourself in firmly.
Yes, Doctor.
Now your arms.
That's to prevent you
from knocking yourself out.
BOND: I see.
How fast does it go?
It can go up to 20 Gs,
but that would be fatal.
Three Gs is equivalent
to take-off pressure.
Most people
pass out at seven.
You make a great saleswoman.
You don't have to worry.
This is what we call
a "Chicken Switch. "
You just keep your
finger on that button,
the moment the pressure
gets too much for you,
release the button
and the power's cut off.
Just like that?
(SWITCH CLICKS)
Come on, Mr. Bond.
A 70-year-old
can take 3 Gs.
Well, the trouble is
there is never a 70-year-old
around when you need one.
GOODHEAD: You want me?
Mr. Drax says
to telephone him.
All right,
I'll call him
from my office.
You go ahead.
I'll be right back.
The instructor will
supervise the session.
Enjoy yourself.
Yes. We're taking
good care of him.
I don't know what
could've happened.
Something must've
gone wrong with
the controls.
Let me help you.
My mother gave me
a list of things
not to do on a first date.
Maybe you won't need it.
That's not what I came for.
No. What do you want then?
Would your feelings
be shattered if I were
to say information?
Why should l
tell you anything?
Why, indeed?
You presume
a great deal, Mr. Bond.
What goes on here
besides the manufacture
of Moonraker?
And the astronaut
training program?
There are
other laboratories,
but not much is
happening now.
No?
They were working
on something very secret,
but everything's been moved.
Where to?
I don't know.
What about that
list of your mother's?
I never learned to read.
(MOANING)
What are you doing?
You whetted my appetite
for information.
Is there a safe
in here? Thank you.
James, no.
That's amazing.
There you are, you see?
You have a heart of gold.
Eighteen karat.
(CLICKING)
You must go.
Well, you go first.
I'll turn off the lights.

Ah, my dear Bond.
This is Mademoiselle Deladier
and La Signorina del Mateo.
Ladies.
DRAX: I'll see you at lunch.
A pity you leave us.
Such good sport.
Unless you're a pheasant.
(CHUCKLING) Really,
Mr. Bond. Take my gun,
a stray bird may fly over.
I only stopped to thank you
for your hospitality.
Fraser will get you
to the airport
in plenty of time.
Come now.
(GUN COCKING)
I doubt if I'm
in your class.
Oh, you're too modest,
Mr. Bond.
(CHIRPING)
Over there.
You missed, Mr. Bond.
Did l?
As you said,
such good sport.
You called for me,
Mr. Drax.
You were with Bond
last night in my study.
No, l...
You showed him the safe.
I didn't.
I'm terminating
your employment.
You will leave immediately.
(DOG BARKING)
(BELL TOLLING)
Franco, I'll call you
to tell you where to meet me.
(AGREEING IN ITALIAN)
Could I interest
you in something?
Why, I'm tempted to
say yes immediately.
But I think maybe
I'd better have
a look around.
Please. Go anywhere
you wish.

GUIDE: And in 1955,
the Venini Museum
and Glass Works
was taken over by
Drax Industries.
And here,
ladies and gentlemen,
we have some of
the rarest examples
of the glassblower's art.
As you know,
everything was done
absolutely by hand.
Here is a vase done
by Lorenzo Graziati,
sometime between
1850 and 1860.
If you'd like to
follow me over here.
This exquisite
bowl was fashioned
about 1520,
over 450 years ago.
If it ever came
on the market,
it would certainly
fetch a price
in excess of one million
American dollars.
But if any of you
are thinking of taking it...
(ALARM BLARING)
(ALL LAUGHING)
GUIDE: Now, we have here
a very early 17th century dish
with an aquamarine medallion.
Over here, we have
something very,
very interesting.
This glass-handled sword,
the only one of its kind
in the world,
was owned by General Menotti
in the late 18th century
and is the work of Bruno...

14th century.
Dr. Goodhead.
I can only hope
your presence here
is a coincidence, Mr. Bond.
I dislike being spied on.
Well, don't we all?
You're staying
at the Danieli,
aren't you?
Yes. How did you know?
Well, I like to
keep abreast of things.
May I ask what
you're doing in Venice?
I'm addressing a seminar
of the European
Space Commission.
My, heavy stuff.
But there again,
I keep forgetting
that you are
more than just
a very beautiful woman.
If you're trying
to be ingratiating,
Mr. Bond, don't bother.
I have more important
things on my mind.
Ah, that's what I'd like
to talk to you about.
Dinner this evening?
This evening I'm
giving my address.
Well, then, can you
think of reason
why we don't have
a drink afterwards?
Not immediately.
But I'm sure I shall.

Your friend Cha

And you think
I had something

Well, the thought
had flashed across my mind.
What's Drax up to
in that laboratory?
Why don't you
ask him yourself?
You leaving me
your telephone number?
I don't see the point.
Ah, now I do.
Not what I want to

James, why don't you

Thank you.

If it's '69,
you were expecting me.

(BEEPING)
Standard CIA equipment.
And the CIA placed you
with Drax, correct?
Very astute of you, James.
Oh, not really.
I have friends
in low places.
Could this possibly
be the moment for us
to pool our resources?
It could have
its compensations.
Where are you planning
on going from here?
I'm not planning
on going anywhere.
Oh, I suppose
you're right, Holly.
We would be better
off working together.
Detente?
Agreed.
Understanding?
Possibly.
Cooperation?
Maybe.
Trust?
Out of the question.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Send the night porter up
for my bags immediately,

(GUARD SPEAKING ITALIAN)
I hope you know what
you're doing, Bond.
I've played bridge
with this fellow Drax.
007 doesn't usually
push the panic button
unless it's
something serious.
I should hope not.
Good morning, Inspector.
Good morning.
I see you've
covered everything
with our Italian friends.
Yes, sir.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Is this it?
Yes, sir.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Gas masks?
We can't afford to take
any chances, Minister.
DRAX: Frederick Gray.
What a surprise.
And in distinguished company,
all wearing gas masks.
You must excuse me, gentlemen,
not being English,
I sometimes find
your sense of humor
rather difficult to follow.
On behalf of
the British government,
I apologize.
I think you owe us
an explanation,007.
I've never been so
humiliated in my life.
Your man should be
taken off the assignment.
I'll see you
at the consulate.
I'll have to do
what he says.
Well, before you
do that, sir,
have Q do
an analysis of this.
I took it from
the laboratory.
Tell him to exercise
extreme caution.
It is lethal.
So, there was a laboratory.
You better take two weeks
leave of absence,007.
Do have any thoughts
about where you might go?
I've always had a hankering
to go to Rio, sir.
I think I can recall
your mentioning it.
007, no slipups
or we're both in trouble.
Yes, a minor crisis
has been averted.
No, no, nothing serious,
but all merchandise
is to be rerouted
as from today.
Now, regarding
a replacement for Cha,
do you have someone in mind?
Oh, yes, well,
if you can get him,
of course.

If I get lost,
I'll take a cab.

Do you come

It depends
who's renting it.
Vodka martini?

Why were you
following me
from the airport?
I was trying to meet you.
My name is Manuela.
I work for Station VH.
We have been
asked to assist you.
M thinks of everything.
Tell me, Manuela,
do the initials
C and W mean anything to you?
C and W?
Yes, Carlos
and Wilmsberg.
They are very big
importers in Rio.
A subsidiary of
the Drax Group, I believe.
They have a warehouse
on Carioca Avenue.
I'd like to pay it
a discreet visit tonight.
Tonight? I think you may
find that a little difficult.
Difficult or not,
it's something we have to do.
And meanwhile,
how do you kill
five hours in Rio
if you don't samba?

There's the warehouse.
And not a soul about.

I did tell you

Did you find
anything in there?
Only this.
"Drax Air Freight. "
Do you know which airport
they operate from?
Yes. San Pietro.
Do you want me
to take you there?
No, I think
you need some rest.
Come on.
I'll drop you off.
Okay.
(LATIN MUSIC PLAYING)
Haven't we met
before somewhere?
The face is familiar,
as is the manner.
It's become distinctly
chilly since Venice.
Well, that was before
you walked out on me.
Yes, nearly tripping over
your suitcase on the way
through the door.
So?
So why waste time
working against each other?
I've checked Drax's
warehouse in town.
It's empty.
That's no surprise.
Since I've been here,
those planes have been
taking off every two hours.
Yes. He's moving out.
Where to?
That's what we're
going to find out,
now that we're
working together.
I still don't know
if I trust you.
I don't know
if I trust you either.
That's what makes it
more exciting, doesn't it?
What's wrong?
I don't know.
But I'm sure we're
better off out than in.
Bring that chain.
Hang on, James.
The thought had
occurred to me.
I might have guessed.
Do you know him?
Not socially.
His name's Jaws.
He kills people.
Here, give me the chain.
Come on. Hang on to me.
Jump.

Have you broken something?

Never mind.

Ah, there you are,007.

Yes, sir.
Where's M?
He's in the office

Q: This way.
Good morning,007.
Good morning, sir.
You're just in time.
Sit down.
Thank you, sir.
Q's come up
with something.
Splendid.
Any news of Dr. Goodhead?
Afraid not. Right, Q.
Well, it's a breakdown
on that phial of liquid
you picked up in Venice.
You know, you seem
to be right,007.
Thank you.
It's a highly toxic nerve gas
that appears to have
no effect on animals.
May I see the formula?
It's a chemical
formula of a plant.
Orchideae anegra.
A very rare orchid indeed.
Yes. It was thought
to be extinct.
Until a missionary
brought one back
from the upper reaches
of the Amazoco.
Well, actually
he brought it back
from the area of
the River Tapirape.
Well done, James.
You better get
up there and fast.
And I've got something
to get him there,
if 007 can be trusted
to look after it.

It was their reverence

Because long-term

You have all served

(SOFTLY) 007.
My God, what's Bond doing?
I think he's attempting
re-entry, sir.
James?
I think it may be
time to go home.
Take me round the world
one more time.
Why not?
Where are you?
Why do you hide?
Where is that moonlight trail
That leads to your side?
Just like the Moonraker goes
In search of his dream of gold
I search for love
For someone to have and hold
I've seen your smile
In a thousand dreams
Felt your touch
And it always seems
You love me
Where are you?
When will we meet?
Take my unfinished life
And make it complete
Just like the Moonraker knows
His dream will
come true someday
I know that you
Are only a kiss away
I've seen your smile
In a thousand dreams
Felt your touch
And it always seems
Mr. Bond, Mr. Bond,
I'm so glad I caught you.
Your office called. They're sending
a helicopter to pick you up.
Some sort of emergency.
It usually is.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, Mr. Bond.
Don't concern yourself
with the pilot.
One of my less useful people.
You are now flying
Remote Control Airways.
Think twice, 007.
It's a long way down.
I've looked forward
to this moment, Mr. Bond.
I intend to enjoy it
to the full.
Really, have you no respect
for the dead?
Good-bye, Mr. Bond.
I trust you had a pleasant...
fright.
You are fading
from my picture, Mr. Bond.
But the end
cannot be far away.
Mr. Bond! Mr. Bond!
We can do a deal!
I'll buy you a delicatessen
in stainless steel.
Please!
All right, keep your hair on.
Put me down!
Put me down!
Oh, you want to get off?
Mr. Bond!
For your eyes only
Can see me through the night
For your eyes only
I never need to hide
You can see so much in me
So much in me that's new
I never felt till I looked at you
For your eyes only
Only for you
You'll see what no one else can see
Now I'm breakin' free
For your eyes only
Only for you
The love I know you need in me
The fantasy you freed in me
Only for you
For your eyes only
The nights are never cold
You really know me
That's all I need to know
Maybe I'm an open book
Because I know you're mine
But you won't need
to read between the lines
For your eyes only
Only for you
You'll see what no one else can see
'cause now I'm breakin' free
For your eyes only
Only for you
The passions that collide in me
The wild, abandoned side of me
Only for you
For your eyes only
Afternoon.
How's it looking topside?
Beautiful day.
Just bringing the nets in.
Fish for supper again.
Decode of Russian satellite data, sir,
on British and American ship positions.
- Verify and advise Admiralty.
- Y es, sir.
- Afternoon, sir.
- Oh, hello, Mac.
My watch.
Where the hell
did that come from?
- What the devil's going on here?
- An unidentified object closing fast.
Destruct ATAC system.
- Yes?
- First Sea Lord and Vice Admiral, sir.
Send them in.
Shocking news, Minister.
I'm afraid we've lost our electronic
surveillance ship, the St. Georges.
We had a routine message
at 1600 hours yesterday...
then nothing.
We sighted floating debris
this morning.
My God, Jack.
How deep is the water there?
Not deep enough, I'm afraid.
Y es, Comrade Secretary.
Off Albania.
The suspected British spy ship
which we have been monitoring.
It suggests that there is a chance
of obtaining...
the ATAC transmitter.
Oh, of course, comrade.
There will be no direct involvement...
but if it comes on the market,
we should not lose...
such a remarkable opportunity.
With that in mind, I've already
contacted our usual friend in Greece.
Down you go. Go on.
Down you go.
Give us a kiss.
Give us a kiss.
I'll give you a nut.
Here you are. Go on.
Come on.
- Your packages, senorita.
- Oh, thank you.
Melina!
- Thank you, darling.
- Hello, Daddy.
Welcome home, Melina, my darling.
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.
Your call from Athens
was such a pleasant surprise.
I was lucky to find you.
You left Crete so suddenly.
Ah, yes, I wanted to come back here
and start work on the temple again.
- You between jobs?
- Only for a few days.
- I'll lend a hand if you want.
- Darling, it's beautiful. Thank you.
That's for you,
and pistachios for Max.
James.
Moneypenny,
a feast for my eyes.
What about the rest of you?
Well, I was going to get
around to that.
You'd better go in.
M's on leave...
and the minister's arrived here
with the chief of staff...
and wants to see you immediately.
- I'll be right back.
- I can hardly wait.
Oh, haven't you forgotten something?
Oh. Well, as M's away--
Ah, there you are, 007.
Minister, Chief of Staff.
Are you aware
of our ATAC system, 007?
ATAC, sir? Automatic Targeting
Attack Communicator.
Uses an ultra-low frequency coded
transmitter...
to order our submarines
to launch ballistic missiles.
Five days ago, our spy ship,
St. Georges was sunk...
in the lonian Sea.
She was equipped with ATAC.
Now, if that transmitter
were to fall into the wrong hands...
it would render our entire
Polaris fleet useless.
- Every order could be countermanded.
- Worse.
Our own submarines could be ordered
to attack our own cities.
Have we begun
a salvage operation, Minister?
An official operation
was out of the question.
The St. Georges was off
the Albanian coast.
We asked Sir Timothy Havelock...
the marine archaeologist,
to secretly locate the wreck.
Before he could send in his report,
he and his wife were killed...
by a Cuban hit man,
Hector Gonzales.
The Greek police were able
to identify Gonzales...
from a description given to them
by Melina, Sir Havelock's daughter.
Operation Undertow.
The information's all here.
Now, Gonzales is at a villa
near Madrid.
Isolate him and apply
the necessary pressure...
to find out who hired him.
A Walther PPK...
standard issue,
British Secret Service.
License to kill.
Or be killed.
Take him away.
Whoever you are, you've outstayed
your welcome. Come on.
- Well, I hope you have a car.
- This way.
Hurry.
- Who are you?
- He killed my parents.
The Havelocks?
I'm sorry.
How did you know
where Gonzales was?
Through a detective agency.
What were you doing there?
I'm afraid we're being
out-horsepowered.
Excuse me.
Take the low road.
Not that low.
You don't mind
if I drive, do you?
Go backwards. Forwards.
Quickly.
I love a drive in the country,
don't you?
Hold tight.
Oh, by the way, we haven't been
properly introduced, Melina.
My name is Bond, James Bond.
Olympic has a flight at 11:00.
It should be safe to go
to the airport now.
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, really.
Are you going back
to your father's ship?
Yes, I'm continuing his work,
but this business is still unfinished.
- What business?
- The man who paid Gonzales.
The Chinese have a saying:
"Before setting out on revenge,
you first dig two graves."
I don't expect you to understand.
You're English,
but I'm half Greek.
And Greek women, like Electra...
always avenge their loved ones.
I must go.
You were meant to question Gonzales,
not let Miss Havelock perforate him.
I quite agree, sir.
We'll have to tell the prime minister
Operation Undertow is dead in the water.
She'll have our guts
for garters.
If you care to look again...
at page two, paragraph four
of my report, sir...
you will note that I saw someone
paying off Gonzales.
Now, assuming that that was
for Havelock's murder...
then there's still
a glimmer of hope.
I don't follow.
If we could identify that someone--
Why don't you try
the identigraph?
- Yes, sir.
- Get cracking, 007.
Minister.
Hello, Q.
Smithers, how's the arm?
Coming along very nicely,
thank you, sir.
Oh, that'll come in handy.
What are you doing here, 007?
- ldentigraph, Q.
- This way.
- Stinging in the rain?
- That's not funny, 007.
I see you managed to get the Lotus
back together again.
I disregard these jibes
about our equipment, 007.
I don't suppose you find it funny
in the field.
Indeed, I don't.
This 3-D Visual ldentigraph
is still in the experimental stage.
Now, once we get
a composite of the man...
we can find a match by patching
into the photographic files...
of the Surety, lnterpol,
ClA, the Mossad.
And the West German police.
You've told me so already five times.
Thank you, 007.
Right.
Now describe the person
you wish to identify...
and I'll program the information.
Male Caucasian,
late thirties.
Hair: fine, light brown.
That's it.
- Parted in the middle.
- Wait a minute.
- Right.
- Eyes.
- A little smaller.
- Uh-huh.
Blue. A little grayer.
That's it. You have it.
Now, nose.
- A nose, not a banana, Q.
- I'm sorry.
Stop.
Lips fuller.
Mm-hmm. Oops.
No, no, mouth wider.
Good.
Thank you.
Thank you, Sharon.
- You can go. I'll lock up.
- Okay.
I reckon we're almost there, Q,
apart from glasses.
Steel-rimmed.
- Yeah.
- Octagonal.
Octagonal.
That's him.
That's our man.
Right. I'll try
and get a match.
Yes.
The man we want is
Emile Leopold Locque...
an enforcer
in the Brussels underworld.
He's been convicted
of several...
particularly brutal murders.
He escaped from Namur Prison...
by strangling his psychiatrist.
He has worked for drug syndicates
in Marseilles and Hong Kong.
Now reported working
for Greek smugglers.
The ltalian Secret Service think
that he is, at this moment, in Cortina.
I'll instruct Ferrara, our man
in northern ltaly, to contact you there.
- Y es, sir.
- And 007, try not to muck it up again.
I'll do my best, sir.
I'll leave you to lock up.
Let me out, will you?
The snow this year
is better at lnnsbruck.
But not at St. Moritz.
- Ferrara.
- Bond. James.
Luigi.
I presume London has briefed you.
If Locque's in Cortina,
we'll find him.
I have a reliable Greek contact here,
an Anglophile.
He helped us out last year
on a smuggling operation.
- What's he doing in Cortina?
- He--
Spends a few months a year here
at his chalet.
He's in shipping, insurance,
oil exploration.
Knows everything going on.
Very reliable.
The British gave him the King's Medal
for resistance fighting during the war.
Yes, but can I meet him?
I've set it up. He is waiting for us
at the Olympic ice rink.
- Kristatos. Ari Kristatos.
- Bond. James Bond.
Would you care to join me
in some gluhwein?
That's a very good idea.
Thank you.
Well, gentlemen,
how can I help you?
We'd like some information.
My protege.
A sure winner...
in the next Olympics.
She's completely absorbed
in her skating...
but innocent in the ways
of the world.
The day she wins the gold medal...
will be the greatest in my life.
Bibi, here are some
new admirers for you.
Mr. Bond, Mr. Ferrara,
Bibi Dahl...
and her coach, Jacoba Brink,
once a world-class skater herself.
I've seen Miss Brink skate.
I think the world will soon be seeing
a great deal of your skating too.
Only if she works harder.
- Much harder.
- Oh, Uncle Ari.
Can I stop now?
I'm pooped.
That's for Miss Brink to decide.
Come, Bibi,
another half hour of practice.
Uncle Ari, will you take me
to the biathlon?
Bibi, you know I have to work
this afternoon.
Bibi wants to know
if you would escort her, Mr. Bond.
- I don't think--
- I would feel better...
if there were someone with her.
I'd be delighted.
I'm staying at the Miramonti.
Great!
How can I help?
- Do you know this man?
- Y es. Locque.
Columbo's right hand.
Milos Columbo.
His name came up in connection...
with a smuggling operation
last year.
That's the least of his offenses.
Drugs, white slavery, contract murder.
In the Greek underworld,
he in known as "the Dove."
A very sick joke.
- Where is this Dove?
- Somewhere in Greece, I would guess.
Once we were like brothers.
Now he hates me.
We fought together
in the Greek resistance...
then against the Communists.
After that,
he took a different path.
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Kristatos.
My pleasure.
I leave for Corfu soon.
If I get any more information,
I will call Ferrara.
What do you think, Luigi?
Does this "Dove" Columbo...
have the resources
to mount a salvage operation?
Oh, definitely. He runs a fleet of
intercoastal freighters in the Aegean.
I'll ring my office in Milano.
They may have more on him.
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.
Is this the one you mean?
Thank you. I'll take it.
Deliver it to the Hotel Cristalo.
I beg your pardon.
- May I help you?
- Y es, give me a dozen lilies.
Will you?
I'll pick them up later.
Come on, quickly.
Send them to the funeral,
will you?
Slow down. Would you mind telling me
what the devil you're doing in Cortina?
- Your telegram.
- What telegram?
It said you found the man
and to meet you here today.
I didn't send it.
Now, get in.
The station, please.
- Are we leaving?
- Not "we." You. And now.
You don't tell me
what to do.
Did you find the man
who hired Gonzales?
I'm working on it.
He's here, isn't he?
That's why you're here.
Driver, stop! Go back!
- I'm staying.
- So you can put an arrow in his back?
You do that, and we'll never find out
who or what is behind all this.
It was my parents they killed,
not yours. Let me out. Driver, stop!
Melina, look at me.
You were lucky once,
but they are onto you now.
The telegram, the motorcycles
back there. They prove it.
- Let me handle this.
- You? How are you involved?
All I can tell you is it's something
of vital interest to both our countries.
More important than my parents?
Your father was part of it.
He thought it important enough
to risk his life.
Now, Melina, please trust me.
Go back to the Triaina and wait.
Let me find out what I can here,
then I'll come straight to Corfu.
- I promise you.
- Okay.
I'll go back and wait,
but not for long.
It won't be, I swear.
Don't they have showers
at the ice rink?
How did you get in here?
One of the porters is a fan.
He'll do anything for me,
and I'll do anything for you.
Well, I'm exceedingly
flattered, Bibi...
but you're in training.
That's a laugh. Everybody knows
it builds up muscle tone.
How about building up a little more
muscle tone by putting on your clothes?
Don't you like me?
I think you're wonderful, Bibi...
but I don't think your Uncle Ari
would approve.
Him? He thinks
I'm still a virgin.
Yes, well, you get your clothes on,
and I'll buy you an ice cream.
Shall we?
Don't you ever come up for air?
That's why I'll get the gold medal--
breath control.
Yes, well, you can't lose.
And now, Erich Kriegler...
Iast year's East European champion.
There's Erich Kriegler.
The East German champion?
Isn't he beautiful?
You know something, Bibi?
You're fickle.
Hey, Erich!
Come on, let's go watch him shoot.
We'll have a drink
at the finish.
Well, Bibi, I'm afraid
I have to leave you.
- No, James, stay with me.
- I have an appointment.
Will you come and say good-bye to me
at the practice rink later?
Please, James, we're going back
to Greece soon.
All right, but if I can't make it...
all I can say is
don't grow up any more.
- Huh?
- The opposite sex won't survive it.
Won't take long.
- Don't play with any of the switches.
- Right.
What took you so long?
I took the scenic route.
Tell me more about your boyfriend,
Erich Kriegler.
He doesn't smoke, he only eats health
foods and he won't even talk to girls.
James, you're jealous.
Of course. What else can you tell me
about my rival for your affections?
They say he's a defector
from East Germany.
It is time
for your rubdown.
I could eat you up alive.
Farewell, Mr. Bond,
but not good-bye.
I'll be finished around 6::00.
Meet me here.
How did you know I was here?
I radio telephoned the Triaina,
and they told me you were coming ashore.
I have to go shopping for the crew.
Come with me, we can talk.
Why not?
Thank you.
I think you may need that.
My father loved the view
from here.
- I can see why.
- We came here often.
- Is Corfu your home?
- No.
My real home's always been
the Triaina, the Greek islands...
Turkey, North Africa--
wherever my father's work took us.
Did he leave any notes?
They could help us.
No, I don't think so.
To tell you the truth...
I haven't had the courage
to go into his study since.
Try not to think about it now.
I'm meeting a man tonight
at the casino who may give us a lead.
You're perspiring, Bunky.
Contessa.
500,000.
Only half?
Where's your courage, Bunky?
Courage is no match
for an unfriendly shoe, Countess.
Bravo, Bunky.
Lucky night.
The odds favor standing pat.
If you play the odds.
Would you cash these in
for me, please?
Thank you. Excuse me.
Aperitif, please?
Ouzo for me, please.
And a whiskey.
And to eat?
I'll have the prawns,
salad and Bourdetto.
An excellent choice.
I'll have the same.
May I suggest a white wine
from my home place?
If you'll forgive me, that's
a little too scented for my palate.
I prefer the Theotaki Aspro.
After our last meeting,
I am asking myself...
why you want to know about Locque,
Columbo's man.
I know Columbo runs heroin
to be refined here...
before it's sent to England.
So I think I see the answer.
You're from the British Narcotics Board.
Am I right?
Go on.
I wish you luck, my friend.
But I must warn you,
stopping Columbo will be difficult.
He has important connections.
You cannot just arrest him.
Find some different way.
You may have to kill him.
Does this discourage you?
- Just tell me where he is.
- Over there.
With the woman in blue.
We ignore each other,
but I wanted you to see him.
He is a secret partner
in this casino.
But we are perfectly safe.
He will do nothing in his own place.
And the countess?
Lisl, an Austrian.
Expensive mistress.
She sometimes shills for the house.
She bets with other people's money.
But I must warn you,
stopping Columbo will be difficult.
He has important connections.
You cannot just arrest him.
You must find a different way.
You may have to kill him.
Does this discourage you?
Just tell me where he is.
You are a disgusting man.
How dare you talk to me like that?
I will speak to you any way I please.
Sit down.
You're making a spectacle
of yourself.
Get out!
Nothing would please me more.
- This may be an opportunity.
- This may be a trap.
If you play the odds.
As you wish. Take my car.
I'll play a little chemin.
Ask the chauffeur
to come back for me.
Allow me.
May I drive you home?
No, thank you.
I'll take a taxi.
No courage?
Seriously, you may have a job
finding one.
Well, you look like a gentleman.
Why not?
I am the Countess Lisl Von Schlaf.
My name is Bond.
I'm writing a novel
about Greek smugglers. Know any?
Smugglers? How would I know
any smugglers?
I would think that
a lady in your position...
would get to know many things.
I'd be most grateful.
How grateful?
Very.
I adore grateful men.
May I call you tomorrow, Countess?
I'm a night person. I have
champagne and oysters in the fridge.
Why not come in for a bite?
I won't need you anymore tonight.
- Cheers.
- Bottoms up.
Whoops!
Me nightie's slipping.
So is your accent, Countess.
- Manchester?
- Close.
Liverpool.
It was an amusing performance...
between you and the owner of this.
What exactly did Columbo whisper to you?
That you're a spy.
To find out more about you.
And have you?
Have I ever.
When you're ready to leave,
you can take my car.
That sounds like a dismissal.
I was looking forward to breakfast.
Lisl, come back!
Get in-- Ooh!
Goodbye, Countess.
What--
- What should I do with you?
- You cannot just arrest him.
You must find a different way.
You may have to kill him.
- Does this discourage you?
- Huh?
Just tell me where he is.
I'm here, Mr. Bond
of the British Secret Service.
But I'll tell you...
it is Kristatos you want, not me.
He told you about himself.
He's the one
with the powerful connections.
Locque works for him,
not for me.
I smuggle, yes.
I smuggle gold, diamonds...
cigarettes, pistachio nuts...
but no heroin.
Sit down.
That I leave to him...
when he is not too busy
working for Russia...
against my country and yours.
My country awarded him the King's Medal.
Yes, I know.
But other people died for it.
During the fighting in Crete,
he was a double agent.
King's Medal.
I would laugh
if my heart was not so heavy...
about my poor Lisl.
What does Kristatos gain
by setting you up?
Well, I know too much about him.
He wants me out of the way.
By using a British agent
to do his dirty work for him...
your government might
give him another medal.
- Why should I believe you?
- I'll prove it to you tonight.
We'll go together to his warehouse...
in Albania, okay?
If I don't report in by morning...
not only my people, but the entire Greek
police will be down on you...
Iike a load of bricks.
Don't worry.
By tomorrow,
we'll be good friends.
Let us drink to that.
I'll wait till tomorrow.
You may need this.
I'm a good judge of men.
Mr. Bond, you have
what the Greeks call tha'ros.
Guts.
So have you, Mr. Columbo.
Cheers.
Santos' drug store.
Watch it.
J.I.M. diving equipment...
for salvage work
at depths of over 300 feet.
- Raw opium.
- An old smuggler's trick.
Kristatos knows them all.
Get your men out of here.
Now.
You left this with Ferrara,
I believe.
Had no head for heights.
Where did the St. Georges sink?
We can't be sure for certain.
We know it was in this vicinity.
Your father was
using the temple as a front.
Kristatos killed your father...
so he wouldn't find
the St. Georges before he did.
Kristatos.
How can I help?
Where does your father
keep his daily log?
Daily log.
Father and he were pals for 30 years.
He repeats everything.
- Give us a kiss.
- What's his name?
Max.
Thank you.
Hello.
It's all shorthand.
He used a special kind.
Only I could decipher it.
He made several surveys in Neptune.
- What's Neptune?
- Our two-man submarine.
He saw a diving bell here.
Diving bell?
Oil exploration. Kristatos.
Three days later,
he sighted a wreck in the same area.
And?
That was his last entry.
The day he was killed.
Air would be useless at this depth.
We need a mixture of oxygen and helium.
I have the necessary equipment.
The less people that know,
the better.
I'll give the crew shore leave
except for the mate and two others.
Let's go.
584 feet.
An oxygen-helium mix will give us
eight minutes. We'll have to work fast.
Wouldn't the crew have destroyed
the transmitter?
Only if they'd had the chance
to set the explosive timer.
We have a visitor below.
Conserve your gas supply.
Speak only when necessary.
I hope he was dining alone.
Go back to the sub.
No, no. I'm staying.
That should be the command cabin.
Eureka!
"Main destruct timer...
under lever right of ATAC housing,
dualled...
by ring main circuit
through anti-handling charger."
The destruct timer's set
at one minute.
For some reason,
the lever wasn't pulled.
The transmitter
with a thermite charge.
Hold these.
"To bypass trembler switch...
cut wires in following procedure."
Cutters.
Screwdriver.
That's it.
Let's get out of here.
James, help!
- James, I won't make it.
- We both will.
Get to the sub.
I'll stall him.
Try and close the CO2.
I'm trying.
Careful, James.
It's 5,000 years old.
Thank you, Mr. Bond.
You have saved us
the trouble of disarming it.
Apostis, take that.
Where are my men?
You will be joining them.
Let the girl go.
We'll double
whatever you're getting.
I never go back on a deal.
It would be bad
for my reputation.
I will deliver it
and return with the money.
The voice of the KGB. Our agreement
was that I designate the meeting place.
After they pay,
I will give them the transmitter.
It must not be let out of your sight.
Nor mine. Where are we going?
We will take the ATAC
to St. Cyril's.
St. Cyril's.
I'll arrange the pickup.
Bind that wound.
We don't want blood in the water yet.
Murderer.
You have shot your last bolt,
Miss Havelock.
Leave their legs free.
They'll make appetizing bait.
I didn't think it
would end like this.
We're not dead yet.
Hold tight.
Turn around. We go again.
Take a deep breath.
Again. Hurry.
Help!
Aw, leave him.
Turn. Run them down.
Follow me.
Ahh. The sharks have them.
Make port.
Thank you.
Hello.
- Give us a kiss.
- Max, not now.
Kristatos is still alive.
And probably headed
to Moscow or Havana by now.
We'll never get him.
Or the ATAC.
ATAC to St. Cyril's.
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.
That's putting it mildly, 007.
Your signal sent Whitehall into shock.
So far we have managed to locate...
439 St. Cyril's in Greece.
Heaven only knows to which one
Kristatos took the ATAC.
I know a well-informed person
to contact about that, Q.
St. Cyril's, where we used to hide
from the Germans.
Only Kristatos would make an abandoned
monastery his personal retreat.
My friend, I've been studying
this place...
for just such an occasion.
We'll split here, huh?
Your best approach is on the right face,
away from the building.
Then you will have to make towards
the shed on the left...
which houses the basket
and the electronic winch.
It can be operated
only from the shed.
Good luck.
Should have brought more people.
- James is counting on surprise.
- But we are only five men.
And one woman.
Eighteen...
nineteen...
twenty.
Fifty more.
That's the pits! I'm supposed to
be skating in Oslo, in lnnsbruck.
Why are we in this creepy place?
Our plans are changed. We are
going to live in Cuba for a few months.
- Cuba!
- You can skate without distractions.
I'll be your audience.
What a drag.
I want to win the gold medal.
We all want that.
I know what you want.
But you're too old for me.
I'm splitting.
- You have poisoned her against me!
- Don't blow your top, Ari.
- Leave her alone.
- I will deal with you...
as I deal with everyone who betrays me.
Bibi...
you're so young.
You must have a sponsor.
I'll find another one.
Go outside and check the guards.
Let me know when the helicopter arrives.
One of Kristatos' killers.
- Aah!
- Shut him up.
Get the door.
Come on, George. Let's go.
Hurry, unless you want me
to go without you.
You know,
I will never leave you.
Your general is late.
Only bad weather would delay him.
Cover the windows.
Let's go.
He's all right. Leave him.
He's all right.
Back!
Okay. Let's go.
I'll be with you.
Sorry.
Cover the door!
Where's Kristatos?
And keep your voice down.
We are leaving him.
He mustn't know until we're gone.
We'll help you if you help us.
Come.
Where are the guards?
That way.
Wait here.
Move!
- Where's Kristatos?
- The other side of the courtyard.
You better stay here.
What have you done to Brink?
- Go back to your room!
- You can go to hell!
Drop it.
- Where's Kristatos?
- He's left with the ATAC.
You're going to pay for it.
You're not as fast
as you used to be.
No, Melina,
that's not the answer.
We'll turn him over
to the Greek police.
Out of my way, James.
All right...
but be prepared to dig
those two graves.
That's detente, comrade.
You don't have it.
I don't have it.
It seems as though Bibi
has a new sponsor.
- How's it going?
- I've patched through...
a high security line
to the satellite.
We can try Bond now.
Good. Are you through to Number 10?
Standing by, sir.
You know what I'd like?
I can't imagine.
A moonlight swim.
007, are you there?
Bond, are you there?
For your eyes only, darling.
- He's there.
- Patch in the prime minister.
I'll get it, Denis.
Hello.
Mr. Bond on the line,
Prime Minister.
Ah, Mr. Bond...
I wanted to call you personally
to say how pleased...
we all are that your mission
was a success, thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
Don't thank me, Mr. Bond.
Your courage and resourcefulness...
are a credit to the nation.
Denis and I look forward
to meeting you.
Meanwhile, if there is anything
I can do for you--
Give us a kiss, give us a kiss.
Well, really, Mr. Bond.
I think we're having
a little trouble with the line, madam.
You idiot.
Get on to him.
007. 007.

- They moved the flight forward.
We'll have to go ahead
as planned anyway.

Please be careful.

(All Time High playing)
All I wanted was a sweet distraction
For an hour or two
Had no intention to do
The things we've done
Funny how it always goes with love
When you don't look, you find
But then we're two of a kind
We move as one
We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more
Than falling in love
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and win
So hold on tight
Let the flight
Begin
I don't want to waste a waking moment
I don't want to sleep
I'm in so strong and so deep
And so are you
In my time I've said these words before
But now I realise
My heart was telling me lies
For you they're true
We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more
Than falling in love
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and win
So hold on tight
Let the flight
Begin
So hold on tight
Let the flight
Begin
We're an all time high
(band playing marching tune)
(leaves rustling)
(balloon bursts)
Argh!
Your guests have arrived, Ambassador.
We should go, my dear.
Well...
I must say,
you become more beautiful every day.
- I'm over here!
- Of course you are!
This is Miss Penelope Smallbone,
my new assistant.
Miss Smallbone.
What can I say, Moneypenny? Except that
she is as attractive and as charming...
- As I used to be?
- I didn't say that.
You're such a flatterer, James.
Moneypenny, you know there never has
been and never will be anybody but you.
So you've told me.
- Welcome to Universal Exports.
- Take it, dear.
- That's all you'll ever get from him.
- Thank you, Commander Bond.
- Do you know me?
- Miss Moneypenny described you.
In nauseating detail.
Really?
I can see you're going
to fit in here very nicely.
- Ah, good morning, 007.
- Morning, sir.
- Minister.
- Commander.
I think you know Jim Fanning,
our art expert.
- Yes. Hello, Jim.
- James.
- Do you know what this is?
- It looks like a Faberg egg, sir.
One of the jewelled eggs by Carl Faberg
as a gift for the Russian royal family.
They're priceless and, uh... And very rare.
This one contains a model
of the imperial state coach.
- Top marks, 007.
- Thank you, sir.
Except it's a fake.
There's the real thing. It's being
auctioned at Sotheby's this afternoon.
This is the fourth egg
to turn up at auction this year.
It's from none of the usual sources.
Anonymous seller,
numbered Swiss bank account.
I'd say that the vendor was a Russian.
And now this turns up.
A near-perfect forgery.
I think Commander Bond
should accompany you to the sale.
Splendid!
I could use an extra pair of eyes!
We could try and spot the seller.
They usually turn up out of interest
or perhaps just to bump up the price.
Thank you, Fanning.
Not at all.
If it is the Russians,
it may be an effort to raise currency
for covert operations abroad
or for payoffs.
Either way,
we'd better find out what they're up to.
- Yes, Minister.
- Eyes only, 007.
Operation Trove.
You'll be replacing 009.
He turned up dead in East Germany
with that egg in his hand.
There's not much to go on.
Well, we do have one lead, Minister.
"Property of a Lady."
The next subject on the agenda
is the continuing mutual
disarmament talks with NATO.
I assume you've all read
General Gogol's report.
It seems very thorough.
Thank you, Comrade Chairman.
I believe I express the opinion
of everyone present
that adoption of NATO proposals does
not compromise our defensive position.
(clears throat) Uh, Comrade Chairman!
General Orlov.
Er, General Gogol is presumptuous.
He speaks for himself and others
who cling to timid, outdated
and unrealistic policies!
Must I remind you, the committee,
of our overwhelming superiority
over NATO forces
before we give it away?
In East Germany
under my direct command,
I have 31 divisions,
including 11 tank divisions
and another five in Czechoslovakia.
In support, on the Russian western
border are 60 divisions,
including 22 tank divisions.
In all, a 10-1 advantage.
American and West German forces
can field at most ten armoured divisions.
The British maintain only a token force.
We have played out a variety of attack
strategies on the new Kutuzov computer
and find that a lightning thrust by
ten armoured divisions from the north,
and by five more
through Czechoslovakia,
lead to total victory in five days
against any possible defence scenario!
This is absolute madness!
We know where it will end.
NATO will counterattack
with nuclear weapons.
Never!
The West is decadent and divided.
It has no stomach
to risk our atomic reprisals.
Throughout Europe, daily demonstrations
demand unilateral nuclear disarmament.
I see no reason to risk war
to satisfy your personal paranoia
and thirst for conquest.
We must turn our energies
to pressing domestic problems.
- General Gogol, let me remind you...
- Comrades, sit down!
- I wish to tell you...
- Both of you!
World socialism
will be achieved peaceably.
- Our military role is strictly defensive.
- Da.
Is that understood, General Orlov?
General Gogol, would you continue?
Thank you, Comrade Chairman. I will
now turn to the specifics of my report...
Tell him I will be there
as quickly as possible.
Please! Please!
- I am trying to concentrate!
- (Orlov) Lenkin!
- What is it?
- It's terrible news, Comrade General!
The reproduction
has been stolen in transit.
The thief was dealt with,
but the egg was lost in the river.
Your incompetence will destroy us all!
- We'll have a replacement made.
- There is no time, Comrade General!
I have just been informed of
an unscheduled inventory in two days!
Control yourself, Lenkin!
I'll tell our London people
we must have the genuine egg back.
I hope we can reach them in time.
(bangs gavel) Sold to Busoni!
The next lot is number 48.
A superb green-gold
lmperial Easter egg by Carl Faberg.
Enamelled in translucent green,
enclosed by gold laurel-leaf trellis.
Set with blue sapphires and
four petalled gold flowers with diamonds.
- How much should it fetch?
- 250-300,000. Anything more'd be crazy.
...used by Tsar Nicholas
in 1897 in Moscow.
Property of a Lady.
Well, there are quite a few ladies here.
She wouldn't have to be here in person.
She could be represented by proxy.
I'll start it at 150,000.
- Any more?
- Now there is a lady.
220,000!
James, stick to the business in hand.
260,000.
300,000!
And 20?
Are you bidding, sir?
320,000. New bidder!
- That's interesting.
- You know him?
- Mm. Kamal Khan. Usually a seller.
- 340,000. 360.
Marginal quality from dubious sources.
380,000.
- 400 in the centre.
- Well, that should do it.
- Kamal has gone over the top.
- Your bid, sir. 400,000.
- 425! New bidder.
- (gasping)
Thank you, sir.
- 425!
- Have you gone mad?
Let's see how badly he wants it.
The bid is 450. 475?
Against you, sir. No more than 450.
- Er, Jim?
- The bid is 450,000.
(gasps)
I have 475.
- 500,000.
- (gasping)
500,000.
I have half a million pounds. All done?
Any more?
Yours, sir, for 500,000!
- The next lot is...
- We could have been stuck with it.
- I doubt it. He had to buy it.
- But why?
That's what I intend to find out.
You had no business bidding for that egg!
What would you have done if you'd got it?
I would have claimed it was a fake, sir,
and not paid.
Not paid?
Here's the original. I switched it
with the fake during the auction.
Good God!
And what happens
when the buyer discovers that?
Well, he... He complains.
If he's legitimate.
- Well?
- I don't think he will complain.
According to Fanning,
this Kamal usually sells. Now he buys.
I believe that the fake will smoke him out.
Our tail followed him to Heathrow
where he got a plane to Delhi.
Hm. You must go there, too.
I'll alert Sadruddin, our man in Station I,
to keep him under surveillance.
- Book yourself on the next flight out.
- Well, I've 55 minutes to catch it, sir.
- Oh, Bond?
- Sir?
Sign a chit for that egg before you go.
It's government property now.
Of course, sir.
(traditional tune)
(plays the Bond theme)
That's a charming tune.
You do take English money?
Only gold sovereigns.
Please.
I'm Vijay.
Special expediter, Universal Exports.
- Welcome to India, Commander Bond.
- Call me James.
- Where's Sadruddin?
- Over here, waiting in the taxi.
This was the wrong cover. I hate snakes!
Taxi! Please be comfortable.
- I am Sadruddin, Head of Section.
- How do you do?
- I booked you in at the Shivnivas Hotel.
- Good. My luggage?
Gone ahead.
What can you tell me about Kamal Khan?
Exiled Afghan prince.
Sportsman - polo, cricket, tennis.
- I play a bit myself.
- Really?
As a matter of fact, I've got
a part-time job as a pro at Kamal's club.
- What have you learned so far?
- My backhand's improved.
(Sadruddin) Kamal lives there on the hill.
The Monsoon Palace. It's heavily guarded.
How do I get to him?
He plays backgammon most evenings
at the hotel casino.
As a guest,
you're automatically a member.
- Then let's meet there later.
- I'll change into something less casual.
Oh, here. You may need this
to play with your asp.
Good morning. Name's Bond.
I believe you have a reservation.
- We've been expecting you.
- Good.
I hope you have a pleasant stay.
I'm sure I will.
Thank you.
Your luggage has been unpacked, sir.
Oh, thank you!
If I can be of further assistance...
- Anything at all?
- Oh, maybe later.
(door closes)
(chatter)
- How's he doing?
- The Major's no novice.
- But Kamal has won 200,000 rupees.
- You'll have a job beating that.
I feel lucky. Shall we double?
Of course!
- Always a double six when you need it!
- Always.
- How do you do it!
- It's all in the wrist.
- Oh, it's hopeless.
- Shall we have another game, Major?
- Same stake?
- Yes, I'll have another go.
Your luck's got to run out some time.
May I join you?
Sotheby's. Half a million pounds?
- The man at the auction.
- Precisely.
You have a good memory for faces.
And figures.
- This can't be a coincidence.
- No.
- What will you have?
- Nothing, thank you.
Some other time, perhaps?
Thank you.
Six and one!
- Well?
- Looks like the Major has got him.
Why don't we make it interesting, Major?
Double to 100,000 rupees.
I can't accept. Not with your luck.
You win!
(Bond) I would have
taken that double, myself.
Then why don't you take over
the Major's position? Mr...?
Bond.
James Bond. Thank you, I'd be delighted.
(Kamal) Double six.
(Kamal) Not such a good double
to accept, after all, was it?
- Double.
- Of course!
You can only win with a double six.
The stake is 200,000 rupees.
Do you have the cash?
Well, I think that this
should be ample security.
- (gasps from spectators)
- Don't you?
Play, Mr Bond.
You need a great deal of luck
to get out of this.
Oh, luck?
Well, then I shall use player's privilege,
and use your lucky dice.
It's all in the wrist.
(dice fall)
Double sixes.
Fancy that!
I prefer cash.
- Get it cashed for him.
- Yes, sir.
Spend the money quickly, Mr Bond.
I intend to, Kamal Khan.
My security.
And yours?
(cracking)
It's not really in the wrist, you know.
- Should I be following them?
- Yes, but I think they'll be following this.
Thank you.
Vijay will take you from here.
I'll see if I can find out more about Kamal.
Good. Hold on to these, will you?
Keep you in curry
for a few weeks, won't it?
Thank you.
It's a wonderful racket, this.
(honking)
- Vijay, we have company!
- No problem. This is a company car.
(screaming)
(talking in Hindi)
(Bond) Step on it!
This should shake 'em off!
Oh. Thank God for hard currency!
Game, set and match! Hang on, James!
(horn)
Keep your head down!
Thank you.
Ow! Ooh, ooh, ooh!
(IN HINDl)
Here! Catch!
Excuse me.
Thank you.
You'd better stick this back yourself.
James, over here! Come on!
Vijay! The money I gave you!
Here! Rupees!
Easy come, easy go!
(gives orders in Hindi)
Hm. It certainly pays to advertise.
This way, James.
Ah, Q!
- How are you?
- Most unhappy, 007, thanks to you.
How can I be expected
to maintain the quality of my work?
Sent out here at a moment's notice!
Have you any smaller thread?
Someone stuck a knife in my wallet.
Ah, they missed you? What a pity!
Karen, see to that, will you?
I've also mislaid my PPK.
- Anything else?
- No, that's all.
Blast!
Having problems keeping it up, Q?
Experimental model.
- Hello, Smithers.
- Commander.
- Smashing, Q.
- Come on. I have a few things for you.
(Bond) Very nice, Smithers.
Is the homing device ready yet?
Not only a homing device, but an
extremely delicate microphone as well.
It goes in there like that.
Now, take a fountain pen.
Twist the top,
and a highly concentrated mixture
of nitric and hydrochloric acid.
- Dissolves all metals.
- Wonderful for poison-pen letters!
Pay attention, 007!
Pull the top off the pen.
With this ultrasensitive earpiece,
you can listen in on the bug.
The homing device is compatible with
the standard-issue
radio directional finder in your watch.
If you haven't lost it.
(beeping)
That's amazing, Q. It does work.
What's that?
Oh, that's the latest liquid crystal TV.
Hm, very handy!
Mm. Perfect image, Q.
Really, 007!
Look, I haven't time
for these adolescent antics.
- It's the best we can do.
- It's beautiful. Thank you.
Go on, get along! I've got my work to do.
- I'll give you a hand, Q.
- Thank you.
Don't forget this.
Don't let him teach you
any of his bad habits!
Mr Bond, your table is ready.
- I didn't reserve one.
- Your guest is waiting, sir.
This way, please.
Thank you.
You changed your mind.
- I'm glad.
- Are you?
Well, let's put it this way.
You are the least lethal and
by far the prettiest of Kamal's friends
that I've come across.
Thank you.
So does he have a proposition for me,
or do you?
He suggests a trade.
The egg for your life.
I'd heard the price of eggs was going up,
but isn't that a little high?
Charge it to, er... Room...
Oh, 27.
Along with the champagne, I suppose?
I'll leave it at the desk.
You don't mind?
Why? Has Kamal forgotten
what I look like already?
It's for me.
So that if I depart this world suddenly
you'll have something
to remember me by?
Something like that.
It's for my scrapbook.
I collect memories.
Well, let's get on with making a few.
- I need refilling.
- Hm?
Of course you do!
Oh. I'll get some more.
Don't bother.
We'll make yours a loving cup.
What a good idea.
Forgive my curiosity, but what is that?
That's my little octopussy.
Good morning!
Morning.
I didn't want to wake you.
But since you're up,
I can say a proper goodbye.
What is the time?
(beeps)
Beautiful view, isn't it?
- I don't know how to say goodbye.
- Actions speak louder than words.
You're so right.
(man) In! Out! In! Out!
In! Out!
Come on, girls! In!
Out!
Check oars!
(birdsong)
The egg has been recovered.
You should be pleased.
(woman) I'm not pleased
it was stolen in the first place.
Nor that the thief
knows enough to bring it here.
He's obviously an adventurer
with possible blackmail on his mind.
Anyway, I have him as my guest
at the Monsoon Palace.
And he will tell us
all he knows very quickly.
- Who is he?
- Englishman.
Likes eggs. Preferably Faberg.
And dice. Preferably loaded.
His name is James Bond.
Bring him here.
(Kamal) He's dangerous. After he's talked,
we must get rid of him immediately.
No.
A "no" from you
has little chance of becoming a "yes".
I assume, therefore,
that the meeting is over.
But you're making a serious mistake.
(beeping)
(beeping quickens)
(knock at door)
Well, so far I can't complain
about the valet service.
Dinner. 8 o'clock.
(locking)
- Good evening, Mr Bond.
- Good evening.
Well rested?
I believe you and Miss Magda have met.
- It was a pleasure.
- You're too kind.
You don't mind if we start?
The souffl can't wait.
At the risk of appearing
to be making light dinner conversation,
may I ask exactly why I am here?
I mean, after all, you do have the egg.
True. But we don't have all the answers.
Well, supposing, for argument's sake,
I don't feel like talking?
Don't worry, you will.
You will.
Let me guess.
Thumbscrews and hot coals.
Hardly! We're much more
sophisticated than that.
- Er... Sodium Pentothal?
- A bit crude. Very unreliable.
We prefer curare with
an effective psychedelic compound.
Guaranteed results.
- But with permanent brain damage.
- An unfortunate side effect.
Ah! One of our specialities.
Stuffed sheep's head.
It's odd,
but when I'm stared at
I seem to lose my appetite.
Oh, thank you for dinner.
Until tomorrow, then.
- Well, I'll say good night.
- I could come in for a nightcap.
Some other time, perhaps.
I don't suppose you'd care for a nightcap?
No.
(birds screech)
(whirr of helicopter)
(INAUDIBLE)
(snoring)
(Kamal) I trust you had a pleasant flight.
If you step this way,
I think you will find everything is in order.
(watch beeping)
I congratulate you on the quality of
your workmanship, Prince Kamal Khan.
Thank you, General Orlov.
As you can see, each piece
has been meticulously duplicated
according to Lenkin's specifications.
Good! Have it put aboard the helicopter.
(gives order in Hindi)
(Orlov) Can they be trusted?
(Kamal) I assure you of their silence.
(Kamal) We are both playing
for enormous stakes.
I get what I want,
then you get the genuine jewellery.
- Exactly...
- (interference)
The precise timing will be essential.
(interference)
Remember: Nothing must be changed.
(interference)
(Orlov) One week from today,
in Karl-Marx-Stadt.
- Karl-Marx-Stadt!
- Correct!
(footsteps)
(talking in Hindi)
(door shuts)
- Everything taken care of?
- As you ordered, Excellence.
- So, you recovered it?
- From an accomplice of the thief.
He must be eliminated at once!
(crackling)
There must be no further security breach.
This fake has caused enough trouble.
I must go.
(Orlov) Everything
has been most satisfactory.
(Kamal) Most kind, General Orlov.
Get Bond!
(shouting in Hindi)
The Englishman has escaped.
He won't go very far. We'll track him.
(shouting and whistling)
(elephant trumpets)
Ooh!
Oooh! Ya-ha!
(petrified screams)
Good!
Let the sport commence.
Ooh! Agh! Yieeehhh!
(growling)
(gives orders in Hindi)
Head him off! Head him off!
(shouting in Hindi)
(roars)
Sit!
We have him! We have him!
Go round! Go round! He's in there!
Hiss off.
(birds squawking)
(shouts in Hindi)
(Tarzan-like jungle call)
(gunfire)
Ow!
Ugh!
(elephant trumpets)
Don't let him get away!
(gunfire)
(shouts in Hindi)
Hey!
- C'mom, buddy, c'mon!
- Give him some room.
- Hey, you all right, buddy?
- I'm fine.
- Are you with our group?
- No, ma'am. I'm with the economy tour.
Mr Bond is indeed a very rare breed.
Soon to be made extinct!
Genus Hapalochlaena. Produces a venom
that's invariably fatal in seconds.
The barge had that sign.
Yes. It belongs to a fabulously wealthy
woman who lives on the floating palace.
Who is she?
No one knows her real name,
but she's known as Octopussy.
That's the name I heard at Kamal's.
I hear that island's full of
beautiful women. No men allowed.
Really? Sexual discrimination.
I'll definitely have to pay it a visit.
(sitar music and women laughing)
(gong)
Good evening.
I wondered when you might arrive.
So you are the mysterious Octopussy.
And you are James Bond.
Am I to be your target for tonight?
Not necessarily.
Depends how much you tell me
about jewellery smuggling.
And why one of our agents
was killed in East Berlin.
I know nothing about that.
You remember Major Dexter Smythe?
You were sent out to arrest him,
weren't you?
You seem to have done your homework.
Thank you. Yes. Smythe, after a brilliant
military career, joined our secret service.
His mission was to recover a cache
of Chinese gold, seized in North Korea.
Both he and his native guide disappeared.
The gold was never found.
And 20 years later
you were sent after him.
The guide's body turned up with a bullet
still in his skull from Smythe's revolver.
I traced Smythe to Sri Lanka,
and gave him 24 hours to clear up
his affairs before I took him back.
He committed suicide rather than
face the disgrace of a court martial.
What's the connection?
He was my father. I'd hoped
fate would bring us together one day.
To avenge him?
No. To thank you
for giving him an alternative.
(knock at door)
Come in.
Kamal Khan to see you.
Bond has escaped.
- How careless of you!
- I apologise.
By the way, I'd like you
to meet my new house guest.
Er, an old friend of the family,
you might say.
How lovely.
You have a nasty habit of surviving.
You know what they say about the fittest.
Octopussy, I would enjoy another
opportunity to take care of Mr Bond
- personally.
- I will take care of Mr Bond myself.
Good night.
And enjoy yourselves.
Mr Bond.
My father became
a leading authority on octopi.
He loved them.
His pet name for me was Octopussy.
Mr Bond, smuggling is no concern
of the secret service.
I've violated no British law.
You are free to leave, but I'd much prefer
if you stayed as my guest for a few days.
I'd like that.
Gwendoline, show Mr Bond to his room.
Good night, Mr Bond.
Till the morning, then.
Midge.
Extend Mr Bond every courtesy,
but double the guard on his quarters.
(speaks Hindi)
He says the island is heavily guarded.
We don't want to
make enemies with the woman.
(Hindi)
The woman must not be harmed.
When Father's gold ran out, the people in
Hong Kong who'd disposed of it for him
offered me a commission
to smuggle some diamonds.
I discovered I had a talent for it.
So you went into business yourself?
Yes, but I needed an organisation,
so I revived the old Octopus cult.
Well, then.
Where did you recruit all these lovelies?
There are many of them
all over Southeast Asia,
looking for a guru,
spiritual discipline, who knows what.
I train them. Give them a purpose,
a sisterhood and a way of life.
- In crime?
- In business.
I have diversified into
shipping, hotels, carnivals and circuses.
- Is he still there?
- You must be joking!
populated exclusively by women?
We won't see him till dawn.
- I'll relieve you at midnight.
- No problem!
(door opens)
Are we going somewhere?
I have to go to Europe tomorrow
on a business trip.
Oh, that's a pity.
I was just beginning to enjoy myself.
I think you should stay.
I'll only be gone a week.
When I come back
we'll discuss the future.
Well, I can't guarantee
that I'll be here when you return.
Oh, James! We're two of a kind.
There are vast rewards for a man
of your talents willing to take risks.
- I'm not for hire.
- Oh! A man of principle!
With a price on his head.
Naturally,
you do it for Queen and country!
I have no country,
I have no price on my head.
I don't have to apologise to you,
a paid assassin, for what I am!
No!
You're right.
We are two of a kind.
Oh, James!
(creaking)
Q?
(birds screech)
Is something wrong?
Not really.
Just a feeling.
Won't you come back to bed?
Move!
Hai-ya!
- James!
- Ooh!
Watch it!
Argh!
Come on!
Careful!
Give me the gun!
Ooh!
(screaming)
What happened to Vijay?
He was alive when I found him.
- Did he say anything?
- All he said was "It was Kamal's men."
No more problems.
- Better signal M to meet me in Berlin.
- Why?
Well, I have to go to a circus
in Karl-Marx-Stadt.
We verified the Octopussy Circus
was in East Berlin when we lost 009.
Karl-Marx-Stadt is further east.
Why would General Orlov
participate in a jewellery caper?
Well, the jewellery, sir,
I think is, if you'll forgive the analogy,
only the tip of the tentacle.
Here's the ID you'll need.
Charles Moreton, manufacturer's
representative from Leeds.
Visiting furniture factories
in East Germany.
- Karl will take you in.
- No problem.
Remember, 007, you're on your own.
Thank you, sir. That's a great comfort.
(laughter and applause)
Meine Damen und Herren,
ich hab' das Vergngen,
euch vorzustellen die Zwillinge...
Mischka und Grischka,
mit ihrer Messerwurfsensation!
(drum roll)
(Grischka counts in Russian
as audience gasps)
(fanfare and applause)
(drum roll)
Mischka!
(wild applause)
(marching tune)
Meine Damen und Herren,
die menschliche Kanonenkugel...
...Francisco der Furchtlose!
(fanfare)
(shouts in Russian)
(drum roll)
(screaming)
(fanfare)
(band playing marching tune)
...fhrt in wenigen Minuten ab.
Achtung, einsteigen. Tren schlieen.
Vorsicht bei der Abfahrt.
Of course you know Comrade Borchoi,
the curator of the Hermitage.
He just arrived from Leningrad.
Hm, the Romanov Star.
The Romanov Star.
Der Sonderzug des Zirkus Octopussy
auf Gleis 2 fhrt in wenigen Minuten ab.
Achtung einsteigen...
Stay here with the jewellery while
they switch the car to the main track.
You stay, also.
The effects are indistinguishable
from the American medium-yield bomb.
The detonator. Now listen carefully.
It is pre-set for a four-hour delay.
Set time for the explosion here.
To activate, insert,
and twist the lever
a quarter-turn clockwise.
Be at least 20 miles away
when it goes off, hm?
The jewellery should net us
We still have to cross the border.
I must go.
Au revoir, dear lady.
Good luck.
Ow!
(train horn)
Bring the canister!
Put it in the car.
Leave that. Let's go.
Let's stay. Sit on that box.
Hands on your knees. Come on, move!
Why is that bomb on the train?
- Who are you?
- I'm British secret service.
You should be more concerned
about getting out of here alive.
I am more concerned about an atomic
bomb exploding on a US Air Force base.
You can't be inviting a nuclear war!
What happens when the US retaliates?
Against whom?
My God. Of course.
Our early-warning system will rule out
the bomb having come from Russia
or anywhere else.
Everyone will assume incorrectly that
it was a US bomb triggered accidentally.
That would be
the most plausible explanation.
Europe will insist on disarmament,
leaving every border undefended
for you to walk across at will.
It doesn't matter a damn to you
that thousands of innocent people
will die in your accident!
Better than letting
a handful of old men in Moscow
bargain away our advantage
in disarmament talks!
On your feet, General!
You're going to stop that train.
(train whistle)
- It's too late.
- You can stop it at the border.
(Orlov) Kill him! Kill him!
(train whistle)
Kill him! Kill him!
(men shouting)
Get to the station!
Stop that car!
Stop!
Follow that car!
(whistle screaming)
Ach du lieber Gott!
Kamal Khan says we are to stay here
until we cross the border.
The licence plate is General Orlov's.
We have discovered this.
- Where is General Orlov now?
- Last reported heading for the border.
Guten Tag.
(guard's whistle)
I must get to that train!
Halt! Stehen bleiben!
Stop!
A common thief!
A disgrace to the uniform.
Yes. But tomorrow,
I shall be a hero
of the Soviet Union.
(train whistle)
It is now 11.45.
The performance begins at 3.
Allowing for delays,
set the bomb to detonate at 3.45.
We must leave the base by 3. 15.
I take it none of you will be late.
(clatter)
Hai-ya!
Argh!
The jewellery!
- Did you recognise him?
- No.
Stay here with her.
Ooh! Argh!
Ahhhh!
Argh!
On the roof. Trouble!
Mischka!
(both scream)
Ooh!
And this
for my brother.
Argh!
And that's for 009.
(cheering and whistling)
(car approaching)
(honks horn)
(military march)
Kommen Sie hier! Kommen Sie hier!
(derisory laughter)
Gobinda will stay with the jewellery.
- Wurst, Bubi?
- Danke, Liebchen.
- Schneller!
- Ja, ja.
- Wurst?
- Wir machen schon. Ist gut!
- Ein Bier?
- Danke schn, sehr freundlich.
(driver) Ja, ja, wir fahren...
(woman chattering) Ja, ja, ja!
- Essen?
- Nichts, danke!
Nehmen Sie ein wenig Wurst.
- Diese Englnder sind ganz verrckt!
- Bitte, Frulein! Ist sehr wichtig...
(band plays circus music)
(INAUDIBLE)
- (door shuts, engine starts)
- Was machen Sie... Das ist mein Auto!
He, mein Auto!
(siren)
General, excuse me. I have some travel
arrangements to make. Enjoy the show.
- Thank you.
- I'm sure he'll get a big blast out of this!
I know he won't be disappointed.
(crowd cheering)
(car fails to start)
(car starts)
(honking)
- That was Bond.
- Good! Let him keep going.
He'll be late and we'll be rid of him too!
Great, isn't it?
(drum roll)
Fantastic! Fantastic!
Marvellous!
General, how long would I get
in the brig if I stole your wallet?
- Er, about two years.
- That long?
Well, in that case, I'd better return it!
Son of a gun!
- Where's the Base Commander?
- Let's see your circus pass.
- Damn it, man, it's urgent!
- (sirens)
Get out, put your hands up!
Gestohlenes Auto!
Captain, some nut went through in
a stolen car. Wants the Base Commander.
He's wearing a red shirt.
There he is! There he is!
Go after that guy in the red shirt.
He's ducked behind the trailers.
Keep searching, you guys.
He's gotta be around here somewhere.
Look under the trailer, you guys.
- (compre) Ladies and gentlemen...
- Hey! Is anyone else in there?
And now for the first time in this country,
the death-defying human cannonball!
I have the pleasure in presenting to you
Francisco the Fearless!
The suspect's wearing a clown suit. Over.
That's him!
Hold it, buddy! You're coming with us.
- General, there's a bomb in that cannon.
- Sure! Where else would a bomb be?
- Great clown!
- I'm deadly serious! I'm a British agent!
- What?
- For God's sake, tell him who I am!
Kamal and Orlov double-crossed you.
I saw them take the jewellery off the train!
Does that convince you?
Sir, that bomb is set to explode at 3.45.
That's 90 seconds from now!
General, this man's either drunk or crazy.
He'll destroy the entire operation.
You two, grab that man!
Grab him! Hold him!
(Bond) Damn it! Let go!
Let me go, there's a bomb in there!
(gasping)
(screaming)
Let him go!
Quiet, everyone! Quiet!
(gasp from crowd)
- Now?
- (riotous laughter)
Thank you. You did a great job.
Where was Kamal going?
Back to India.
(General) Folks, we've had an emergency,
but everything is all right now.
You and your families are safe.
Now, please leave the tent
in an orderly manner. Thank you.
- The plane is refuelled.
- We'll take off at sunrise.
- Are the gold certificates on board?
- Yes, Excellence.
We'll take these also.
Dollars, pounds, francs, marks.
I can always print my own.
(music and laughter)
- What is that?
- Girls selling themselves.
Good. It will keep the men occupied.
I don't want them to see me leave.
Now!
Argh!
Give us a hand.
Come on! Shh!
Let's go. All set?
Lift!
That's it. Steady.
- Make sure the horses are saddled.
- Yes, Excellence.
I'll join you in a few minutes.
- Do you really think you can escape me?
- Orlov betrayed us.
I swear I knew nothing about the bomb.
We're partners, we're friends. Octopussy,
I would never do anything to hurt you.
(gives order in Hindi)
You left me to be killed
along with thousands of innocent people!
Octopussy.
Look! I was bringing you this.
We can make millions.
(alarm bell)
Take her! She's our ticket out of here.
- I trust you can handle this contraption.
- It goes by hot air.
Oh, then you can!
(Q) They're doing fine.
(Bond) But I don't see Octopussy.
- There she is! She's in trouble!
- Get your hands off me!
- (Q) I'll take her down.
- No! Up!
Where are you going?
Look, don't be an idiot, 007. Come back!
Kill him!
(Hindi)
(gasping)
Come on!
What are you doing?
Cut it out! We haven't time for that!
- Ah.
- Later perhaps.
Come on! Giddap!
Come on! Come on!
(rattling)
He'll kill us all! Go out and get him!
- Out there?
- Go!
Yes, Excellence.
Aaagghh!
- Jump!
- Ohhhhh!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
My government categorically denies
the incident ever occurred.
However, we request Bond to return
one of our most historic treasures,
the Romanov Star.
In the interests of our Anglo-Soviet
relationships, that can be arranged.
Ah, where is Commander Bond?
Well, owing to the serious nature of his
injuries, he's still not fit enough to travel.
In! Out! In! Out!
- I wish...
- What?
I wish you weren't
in such a weakened condition.
Oh, James!
Mmmm!
James!
(All Time High playing)
All I wanted was a sweet distraction
For an hour or two
Had no intention to do
The things we've done
Funny how it always goes with love
When you don't look, you find
But then we're two of a kind
We move as one
We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more
Than falling in love
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and win
So hold on tight
Let the flight
Begin
I don't want to waste a waking moment
I don't want to sleep
I'm in so strong and so deep
And so are you
In my time I've said these words before
But now I realise
My heart was telling me lies
For you they're true
We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more
Than falling in love
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and win
So hold on tight
Let the flight
Begin
So hold on tight
Let the flight
Begin
We're an all time high
You walk in a room.
A woman can feel the heat.
One look is a guarantee.
Nights could be long and sweet.
The message is clear.
Like nothing I've ever known.
But from all that I hear.
Forget about long-range plans.
'Cause this man's got his own.
To get mixed up with.
A man who says never.
May be big trouble, but then
I just could be the woman to take you.
And make you never say never again.
Never, never say never again.
Never, never say never again.
Never, never say never again.
Never, never say never again.
You've got all the moves.
No matter your attitude or your mood
I'll come through.
The touch of your voice.
The feel of your eyes on me.
You leave me no choice.
Though I know there's danger there
I don't care, let it be.
To get in bed with.
A man who says never.
May have no future, but then
I just could be the woman to reach you.
And teach you to never say never again
I'll beg you I'll get you
I'll reach you I'll teach you
I'll take you I'll make you.
One minute, 47 seconds, sir.
Not too shabby, sir.
But dead, 007. Dead!
You should have studied
the plot more carefully.
Fanatical revolutionaries
kidnap a millionaire's daughter
and hold her captive for eight weeks.
Of course she could have been brainwashed.
Could have turned.
Evidently she did.
With due respect, sir,
I played your war games for two
weeks and I only got killed once.
Twice.
You've forgotten the land
mine on the Black Sea beach.
Correction, sir. I lost both legs.
I did not die.
You were immobilized.
It can never be the same
playing with blanks.
It is somewhat different in the field.
With your life on the line, you...
Well, your adrenaline gives you an edge.
But is your edge sharp enough?
That's the difference between
a double-0 and a corpse.
Since you took over, sir, you've
had little use for the double-0's.
I've spent most of my
time teaching, not doing.
I'll make you no secret.
I hold your methods in much less regard
than my illustrious predecessor did.
But my duty is to keep you up to par.
Too many free radicals,
that's your problem.
Free radicals, sir?
Yeah, they're toxins that
destroy the body and the brain.
Caused by eating too much
red meat and white bread
and too many dry martinis.
Then I shall cut out the white bread, sir.
You'll do more than that, 007.
From now on, you will be suffering a
strict regimen of diet and exercise.
We shall purge those toxins from you.
Shrublands? You've got it.
Have you got an assignment, James?
Yes. Yes, Moneypenny.
I'm to eliminate all free radicals.
Oh!
Do be careful.
Come on, now. Keep up with me.
Welcome to Shrublands, sir.
Thank you.
My word. They don't make
them like this anymore.
You're right.
It's still in pretty good shape.
This way, sir.
Your body's got enough scar
tissue for an entire regiment.
Right. But it's still in pretty good shape.
We'll be the judge of that, Mr. Bond.
Our job is not just to rehabilitate you.
It's to re-educate you.
I want to open your mind to the virtues of
nutrition, proper exercise, meditation,
and, hopefully, spiritual enlightenment.
I'd like you to see the iridologist
at 4:00, have a colonic at 5:00,
and then you can cut along
to the light-dining room
and have a refreshing cup of parsley tea.
Mr. Bond, I need a urine sample.
If you could fill this beaker for me.
From here?
Box 274 and quickly, please.
We have invested extensively
in the Middle East and Central America
to promote insurgency and revolution.
Fortunately, our capital outlay
has been handsomely offset
by the resultant sales of
armaments and missiles.
You will note that we have supplied
both rebels and government forces
on an equal basis.
In matters of death, SPECTRE
is strictly impartial.
Now for the future.
SPECTRE's most audacious enterprise of any,
next to which our previous
ventures are inconsequential.
Our esteemed Number One is in complete
charge of the entire operation,
which will henceforth be
called "The Tears of Allah."
He will now join us.
According to plans, an
American Air Force officer
has been introduced to a
cruel mistress, heroin.
I understand he is now our
willing and obedient servant.
A surgical operation has
been performed on him.
As a result of a corneal implant,
his right eye print is now an exact replica
of that of the President
of the United States.
He will soon be moved to a
convalescent clinic near London.
I have chosen Number 12 to
have the responsibility
of taking the most tender loving
care of Captain Jack Petachi.
I beg your pardon.
Is there no speed limit here?
She's not staff. She must be
one of those private nurses.
My name is Bond.
You're Mr. Bond. I believe I'm
having you in half an hour.
Splendid! Your room or mine?
Mine.
That's it. Okay, now just move
back on the couch for me, please.
That's it. Right. Now, let's
have this arm on the shoulder.
This one... No, underneath there.
That's good.
Okay, now just relax.
Yes, there are slight lesions
of the thoracic vertebrae.
Now, just hold still.
Yes. Some sacroiliac strain
at the base of the spine.
You know, there is a more beneficial
therapy for a man's lower back.
Oh, really? And what might that be?
I thought I'd surprise you, James.
Well, you have. Come in.
No, no, no, no. I can't come in.
You know if they found me here
they'd fire me on the spot.
I won't let anyone find you. Don't worry.
I have my reputation to think of.
I don't think you got your reputation
by living on a diet of wild rice.
So, lentil delight. Dandelion salad.
Goat's cheese.
Beluga caviar. Quail's eggs. Vodka.
Foie gras.
Strasbourg.
Jack's been smoking again!
Jack was ordered not to smoke.
Smoking is dirty.
It gets into Jack's eye.
Jack must do as he's told if he wants
his fast cars and his pretty clothes.
And if he wants to keep his
sister alive, he's got to...
You leave Domino out of this!
James?
Get up!
Now let's just take a look, shall we?
Very good.
With a contact lens, both eyes
will look exactly the same.
Now, darling must do his little
trickie in eight seconds.
Then nursie will give baby his candy.
P-3-4-1.
Come on, Jack.
Oh, damn.
Try it again, darling!
- Who's that?
- A man!
At the window!
Don't move.
Did he see you?
I don't know.
I guess he could have.
Do you know him?
Oh, yes. 007.
- Good morning, Mr. Bond.
- Good morning.
Miss Fearing tells me you're
making fine progress.
Oh, yes.
But I must say, you're looking
a bit peaked this morning.
I was up all night.
Don't overdo it.
A herbal enema should fix you up.
Thank you.
Sounds terrific.
I'll be done in a minute.
Heavy, Mr. Bond?
Let's try again.
You lunatics.
I send you to a health farm
to get yourself in shape.
Instead you demolish it.
I've had to notify the local police,
pull out the special branch,
get the minister to muzzle the press
and allocate a sizeable
chunk of my meager budget
to renovating the establishment!
A man did try to kill me, sir.
No, caught you seducing his wife, did he?
No, sir, not at all.
But in fact, I lost four pounds,
and God knows how many free radicals.
That is the kind of attitude that
tempts me to suspend you, 007!
Now, this test is to assess
distance and accuracy
of cruise-missile release
from the support country.
Now, these ALCMs with dummy warheads
will go from terrain following,
to inertial guidance, over
water, toward the target.
We hope.
Stand by.
Countdown is go for dummy
warhead loading and B-1 flight.
Let's hope we never have to use
the real thing. Good luck.
All right, men. This is it.
Let's make it a good one.
1-0-1, Depot One.
Mr. President, please stand by
while authority for this procedure
is confirmed by eye-print check.
If confirmation is not authenticated
within eight seconds,
the base will be sealed.
Eight, seven, six, five...
Come on... four, three, two...
Come on.
One. Thank you.
Presidential authority is confirmed
for change of test procedure.
Dummy warheads will be replaced
by W80 thermonuclear device.
Have a nice day.
Jack!
Bravo!
Oh, no! No!
Oh!
My poor angel. My sweet baby.
Mr. Kovacs, how much longer?
They're coming. They're almost in range.
Range safety officer to base. Alert.
Radar confirms both missiles
on descent trajectory. Repeat.
What the hell's going on here?
They've got maximum thrust,
but they're still going down.
About to cross minimum cruise height.
Descending below minimum cruise height.
Damn! We've lost them.
We've got them.
Well, Kovacs?
The fish are netted.
Put them on ice.
I am supreme commander of SPECTRE,
the Special Executive
for Counterintelligence,
Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion.
Yesterday morning,
the American Air Force
launched two cruise missiles
from Swadley airbase in Great Britain.
Through the ingenuity of SPECTRE,
the dummy warheads they carried
were replaced with live nuclear warheads.
Your weapons of destruction are
now safely in our possession
and will be moved to two secret targets.
Please note the serial
numbers of the missiles.
They will confirm the truth.
Your weapons of deterrence did
not deter us from our objective.
A terrible catastrophe now confronts you.
However, it can be avoided by paying
a tribute to our organization,
amounting to 25o/o of your respective
countries' annual oil purchases.
We have accomplished two of the functions
that the name SPECTRE embodies,
terror and extortion.
If our demands are not
met within seven days,
we shall ruthlessly apply
the third, revenge.
That would be $25 billion a year!
Order, gentlemen, please. Order!
These demands would destabilize
the monetary system!
I call this meeting to order!
The foreign secretary wishes to address you!
Lord Ambrose.
Gentlemen, we are faced with
the ultimate nightmare,
the abduction of nuclear warheads.
But how is this possible?
Up to this point, our fail-safe
procedures relating to nuclear hardware
have been absolutely foolproof.
I hope the American government realizes
its awesome responsibility in this matter.
NATO has a joint responsibility
to solve this problem, gentlemen.
But if this gets out, it
will cause worldwide panic.
How well has this
information been contained?
Apart from those present in this room,
the information resides only with
the CIA and British Intelligence.
Wonderful. That means by now
it's all over the Kremlin.
I know your feelings, M, but I insist
you reactivate the double-0's.
As you wish, sir.
Maximilian Largo, born Bucharest, 1945.
Industrialist and philanthropist.
Resident Nassau, Bahamas. No
known criminal activities...
Here you are.
You still here, Moneypenny?
You should be in bed.
James, we both should be.
Instead I'm looking everywhere for you.
Forget that.
M wants to see you right now.
It's panic stations upstairs.
He's been with the Prime Minister all day.
I think you're back in business, James.
Welcome home.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Morning. Morning.
- The latest reports?
- Everything okay?
Yes, sir.
Good morning.
Good morning, Charles.
In absolute secrecy, the Americans
are trying to trace the missile
that's on their eastern seaboard.
The other allegedly threatens the
oilfields of the Middle East.
How well protected are they from the air?
Everyone's collaborating. The
Americans, NATO, the Japanese.
They're putting up an air screen
a mosquito couldn't get through.
Our concern is that the warhead
may already be in position.
The worst devastation would result
from a subterranean explosion.
You see, the oil-bearing
strata in the area,
interconnected by a surprisingly
delicate structure...
It would be a sort of ripple effect.
What's the Americans' story on
how the damn things were stolen?
The release of ALCMs has to come
from the President himself.
Even that has safeguards.
It can only be authorized after
a scan of his right eye.
The only irregularity they've discovered
is that a communications officer
unofficially left the base
at the time of the launch.
A certain Captain Jack Petachi.
If this Petachi was involved,
is it conceivable that he
could have used a false eye?
Do come along, Bond.
Let's think of a more logical
explanation, shall we?
Okay, let's run through that routine
we were working on yesterday...
It'll make you strong.
There.
Let's go again.
Okay.
Four, five, six, seven, down.
Come on, now.
Max!
As usual, I have left you
alone too long. I know.
But I brought you a gift.
I don't want any more gifts.
I just want you. That's all I want.
I know, but this is different.
Look. Max.
Look.
What is it?
It's very old.
What's the inscription?
Arabic. The Tears of Allah.
The story is that the Prophet wept
for the barrenness of the desert,
and his tears made a well.
It's a legend, of course,
but like all great legends,
it is also the truth.
It is the most valuable thing
I have ever possessed. Except you.
And you trust me to wear it?
A safer place than around your
neck, I couldn't imagine.
And what if I ever leave you?
No, really!
Then I cut your throat.
Nice to know even old Q can surprise
one of you double-0's occasionally.
Algernon.
Not quite perfected yet.
You could write a very
binding contract with this.
Yeah, I wish I had a new contract.
They've slashed my budget, you see.
You can't get the spare parts.
And when you can, there's usually
some strike that stops delivery.
And look at this place. They keep
it bloody freezing down here.
Plays havoc with my sinuses.
We're both humble servants
of the Crown, Algy.
If the CIA made me an offer,
I'd be off like a shot.
Unlimited resources, air conditioning,
28 flavors of ice cream in the restaurant.
It's a motorbike toy.
If I can get the thing to work
properly, I'll ship it out to you.
Wait a minute. I've got something
in here that could be useful.
The prototype came from a KGB defector.
Bit of a whiz kid in
their technical section.
Not a bad chap, though like all
defectors, prone to melancholy.
I suppose it's all that
vodka and English weather.
Rather tasty, this is. It looks like
a watch, but it's really a laser.
Keeps perfect time.
But for how long?
At least your lifetime.
Good to see you, Mr. Bond.
Things have been awfully dull round here.
Bureaucrats running the old place,
everything done by the book.
Can't make a decision unless the
computer gives you the go-ahead.
Now you're on this,
I hope we're going to have some
gratuitous sex and violence.
I certainly hope so, too. What is this for?
I'll show you.
You unscrew it, then stick it up your nose.
It's for my sinus.
Well, I won't need one of
these where I'm going.
Where's that?
Or are you not allowed to say?
The Bahamas.
Lucky bloody you!
Sorry.
That's perfectly all right.
What are you hoping to catch?
Something about 6'2", 190
pounds, with brown eyes.
Well, why bother going to sea?
Let me help you.
Mr. Bond!
I say, Mr. Bond!
Catch you later, perhaps.
Right.
Nigel Small-Fawcett,
British embassy, Nassau.
How do you do, Nigel?
Sorry I'm late.
But as you're one of these
undercover johnnies,
I took the precaution
of not being followed.
And that's why you shouted
my name across the harbor?
Oh, God, did I? I'm sorry.
Damn. Damn!
Sorry. I'm rather new to all this.
What's the score with Largo?
He's highly visible in these parts.
Enormously wealthy. Owns the
biggest boat in the Caribbean.
Spends a lot of his time at a
place called Bluebeard Reef.
Marine archeology, I gather.
You've met him?
Oh, yes. He's charming.
I mean, foreign, but charming nonetheless.
He donates a lot of money to worthy causes.
He built a maritime museum and
a new wing for the orphanage.
I'm sure he's very kind to his mother.
Don't know his mother.
You're not going to make any
trouble, are you, Mr. Bond?
Let's face it, your
reputation has preceded you.
Do I look like the sort of
man who would make trouble?
Well, yes, frankly.
And you're going to
jeopardize the tourist trade
if you start going around killing people.
Nigel, please. Just go back to your desk.
Find out where Largo's
boat is at the moment.
Call me later. I'll be at my hotel.
Jolly good. I'll get onto that at once.
And take full advantage
of the natural cover.
Is this the Flying Saucer?
Yeah. It sailed this morning.
How reckless of me. I made you all wet.
Yes, but my martini's still dry.
My name's James.
Hello, James. I'm Fatima Blush.
You ski very well.
I do many things very well.
I'm sure you do.
What brings you to Nassau, James?
I'm fishing.
For what?
Anything I can get.
I know the best waters.
I'd be very happy to show them to you.
Now, why would you want to do that?
I'd like you to find
what you're looking for.
I'm all yours.
Yes?
James, would you come down please?
Right away.
I think this should take
care of you perfectly.
I'm sure it will.
You're marvelously well-equipped.
Thank you, James.
So are you.
Thank you.
What exactly are we going down for?
Sport and a little fun.
You appear tense.
You affect me, James.
Well, that's bad.
Going down, one should always be relaxed.
Is it far to the reef?
It's far enough.
We've got time to kill.
It's you.
Well, you did say you'd catch me later.
Oh, my God.
623 and...
Here you are. No messages.
Hello?
Mr. Bond, I've finally tracked you down.
Small-Fawcett here.
I hope I haven't caught
you at an awkward moment.
No, not at all. Just be brief.
I don't have too much time.
Just want you to know that
I'm on top of things.
I've found out that Largo's boat is
en route for the south of France.
Well done.
It was nothing, really.
If you're free tomorrow, why
don't we go snorkeling?
Sounds a wonderful idea.
Jolly good, Bond!
Because I was wanting
to discuss with you...
What's that?
Mr. Bond?
Proof that we made the right decision.
About what, darling?
Your place or mine.
I found a villa for us just
where you wanted. It's perfect.
The Flying Saucer is
anchored in the bay below.
And Q sent this.
Thank you.
- Catch!
- Get down!
- Felix.
- Not bad.
Not bad at all. Nothing
wrong with your reflexes.
How you doing, buddy?
What the hell are you doing here?
CIA sent me to ride shotgun with you.
- 326.
- How do you do?
Excuse my inexperience. Nicole.
I'm Felix Leiter. Enchant.
Thank you. My car is right there.
I ran some checks in the Langley computer.
Anything on Largo?
No, he's squeaky clean.
I must say, for once, your
hunch was wrong, buddy.
- Algernon, right?
- Yes.
I had the first one of those
things, and it blew up in my face.
A motorbike came for you from England.
Here's the papers.
What are you gonna do with this bike?
I won't know until I test it.
It's gonna be your ass, James.
Thank you.
Felix?
Yeah.
Forget the soup.
Feast your eyes on that.
What've you got here, James?
That's Largo's lady.
Her name is Domino. Domino Petachi.
Petachi. The Air Force officer
killed in that car crash.
Jack Petachi.
That's right. He was her brother.
Well, there's the man himself.
If he's got the bombs, do you think
he'd have them on his yacht?
Unlikely. But get some scuba gear.
We'll check her out.
Right.
Welcome to the Centre de la Sant.
I hope you enjoy our facilities.
Do you serve men here?
But of course.
Some men more than others.
Miss Petachi. No one told me
you were here. I am sorry.
You speak English, yes?
Yes. Quite well, in fact.
Now, hard or soft massage?
Hard, please.
Well, perhaps we should
begin with your back.
I don't believe we've seen
you around here before.
No, I was on a boat.
And what boat would that be?
The Flying Saucer.
Mr. Largo's boat.
Yes. Do you know Mr. Largo?
I know of him.
I know he owns many beautiful things.
Yes, he's a very generous man, Mr. Largo.
I'm sure he is.
He's giving a charity ball tonight
at the casino, for children.
What a worthy cause.
Perhaps I should attend.
I'd really like to ask you. I would.
But I'm afraid the guest list
is very restricted. I'm sorry.
C'est la vie.
C'est la vie?
Such is life.
Such is life.
That feels so good.
Certainly does.
Excuse me?
It certainly does need it.
You have slight lesions
in the upper vertebrae.
Could you go a little lower, please?
Lower?
Yes, please.
Please.
Right there.
That feels so good.
I am sorry, mademoiselle.
We are so very busy today.
Where'd the masseur go?
Who?
The man, the...
The man I pass? He does not work here.
They'll never let you in.
I'd better wait for you.
No, Nicole. You go back to the villa.
Find that villa.
Wait a minute! You there!
I shouldn't have the fish.
You must have an unreasonable fear of
gatecrashers to carry this heavy artillery.
This bomb has a tiny gyroscope inside.
Any lateral movement on your part
and you could be served in an egg cup.
If you understand what's being
explained to you, nod gently.
Good boy. Stay.
Hello again. I do owe you an explanation.
My name is Bond. James Bond.
May I offer you a drink?
Hard or soft?
Soft.
I'll have a double Bloody Mary with
plenty of Worcestershire sauce.
Hate to think what you mean by hard.
Vodka on the rocks for me.
I think you have lost her.
Can you actually imagine
that I could lose a woman
to a underpaid British agent?
Yeah?
Yeah.
And I warn you, if he's
not executed at once,
he'll have your Domino turned over.
Is it possible that you
have bungled your attempts
because you want him for yourself?
Maximilian.
Why torture yourself
over that kind of woman?
Maybe one day you'll have
to kill her, Fatima.
Your sense of humor is delicious.
What's your brother up to these days?
He's on his way here. I
can't wait to see him.
How do you know my brother?
Hello!
You must be Mr. James Bond, right?
Monsieur Largo.
Yes, right. Are you a man who enjoys games?
Depends with whom I'm playing.
Yeah. Shall we? Join us.
These are my friends. They honored
me by coming from all over the world
to lose their money for
my favorite charity.
And what might that be?
Children. Orphan children.
So, here we are.
The game is called Domination.
I designed it myself.
But my problem is I've never
yet found a worthy adversary.
No doubt I shall disappoint you, too.
We'll see.
Darling?
This game has one objective, power.
We will be fighting for countries,
chosen at random by the machine.
But for this demonstration,
I will choose France.
Target areas will light up on the map.
Whoever hits them first with his
laser beam will score a point.
But there is another way to win.
With your left hand, you
control two nuclear missiles.
With your right hand, you control
a shield to block my missiles.
But if you fail... Boom, I win the game.
You will be red. I will be blue.
Are you ready?
Yes.
Begin.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Eternal battle for the
domination of the world begins.
We play for dollars.
Random target selection, Spain.
Value $9,000.
Play.
Blue wins $9,000.
Gave me a shock.
I'm sorry. I forgot.
Unlike armchair generals, we will
share the pain of our soldiers
in the form of electric shocks.
One last point,
if you let go of the controls,
you forfeit the game.
As you were unaware of
this, we will begin again.
Reset. Thank you.
Random target selection, Japan.
Value, $16,000.
Play.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Blue wins $16,000.
A lucky move on my part.
Perhaps I didn't explain.
As the stakes increase, so
does the level of pain.
Rather like life. We continue?
Of course.
Good.
Eternal battle for the
domination of the world begins.
Random target selection, the United States.
Value, $42,000. Play.
Red pain level at 50o/o.
Danger level. Repeat. Danger level.
60%.
65%.
Red pain level, 80o/o. Danger. Danger.
Danger.
Domino.
Excuse me.
Are you all right?
Fine.
You lost $58,000.
It goes, of course, to my charity.
I think it's better if we don't continue.
Can we play one more game
for the rest of the world?
Win or lose?
You know what that could mean?
Yes.
Good.
Best of luck.
You, too.
Final game. Remaining
countries of the world.
Value, $325,000.
Play.
Blue missile destroyed.
Blue pain level, 50%.
Danger level. Repeat. Danger level.
Second blue missile destroyed.
Blue pain level, 55%. Danger.
Max.
65%.
Blue pain level, 70%.
Pain level at 80%. Max.
85%. Danger. Danger.
Max. Danger.
Excuse me.
It seems I underestimated you.
$267,000.
I'll settle for one dance with Domino.
So...
Do you lose as gracefully as you win?
I wouldn't know. I've never lost.
This game has been played
and I have lost. That's it.
He's never gone this far before.
He's certifiable.
A tango, yes?
What is it you're after?
In part, it's about your brother.
What about my brother?
Did you know that your brother
was working for Largo?
That's impossible. Jack is in the U.S.
Air Force.
That's precisely why Largo used him.
Your brother's dead.
Keep dancing. Largo is the prime suspect.
Your brother was used and then eliminated.
They move well together, don't they?
Today you have another chance.
This time you'd better not fail.
Number 12.
Excellent.
You dance amazingly well, Mr. Bond.
It's Domino, really.
She's such a pleasure to follow.
I know.
I'd love to have you for lunch.
If you are still around tomorrow,
why don't you join us on our boat?
Tomorrow's not good for me.
Why?
I'm going to pick up Jack.
No. That's not possible.
Jack phoned earlier to say
he'd been delayed again.
At least for another week, maybe two.
Bye-bye.
Thank you very much.
Nicole?
Nicole.
Don't touch him! He's mine!
Come on, come on! Come on, come on!
Hold it.
Sit up.
Your gun.
Carefully.
Over here.
Spread your legs.
Good. Very good.
You're quite a man, Mr. James Bond.
But I am a superior woman.
Guess where you get the first one.
Well, in view of your hatred of men...
Liar!
You know that making love to Fatima was
the greatest pleasure of your life.
Well, to be perfectly honest,
there was this girl in Philadelphia...
Shut up!
I am the best.
Yes. Yes, you're right.
In fact, I was going to put you
in my memoirs as number one.
Write.
Write.
Now write this.
The greatest rapture in my life was
afforded me in a boat in Nassau
by Fatima Blush.
Signed James Bond, 007.
I just remembered.
It's against service policy for
agents to give out endorsements.
Write!
Right now?
Right now.
Not perfected yet.
Good show, James. Q actually
came through, didn't he?
How long have you been here?
Long enough.
Long enough for what?
To see how you handled the lady.
You did rather well.
Come on. This way.
Monsieur Largo is waiting for you, sir.
Of course. Thank you.
This way, sir.
Hello.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
You are a bit early for lunch.
I know. It's rather embarrassing.
Prepare for departure.
Steward, get some clothes for my guest.
I'm overwhelmed.
I'm invited for lunch and given a cruise.
Why? You had other plans?
No, not at all. I'm at your disposal.
Of course. Cigarette?
No, not today, thank you.
So...
A drink? A vodka martini?
Of course.
This is my situation room.
From here, the world comes to me.
You could run a small government from here.
Oh, no, I could run a large
government from here.
What's your latest venture?
Oil.
It's a new departure for me,
besides which all my other enterprises
are of little consequence.
Well, if it's that big, let's hope
it doesn't blow up in your face.
Mr. Bond. Excuse me. I have work to do.
Time is money.
By the way, the staterooms are aft.
Don't forget, 12:00. Lunch.
Mr. Bond, enjoy the ship.
Mr. Bond!
There's some fresh clothes
in your cabin, sir.
If you'd like to follow me.
Thank you.
What happened to my brother?
Why are you here?
Just trust me.
The Tears of Allah.
Does that mean anything to you?
This is it. He gave it to me.
He said it was very valuable.
It doesn't look it.
Have you any idea where we're heading?
North Africa.
He's got a house, a place called Palmyra.
Somehow I've got to transmit
a message out of here.
It could be risky, but I'm
going to need your help.
What do you want me to do?
I'm going to kiss you.
I want you to respond as if you liked it.
I'm doing this for two very good reasons.
One, because I'm hoping
to provoke a reaction.
And the other one?
Because I always wanted to.
False alarm! False alarm!
All crew return to stations.
We've just picked up a message
from one of our ships in the Med.
I think it's from Bond, sir.
About time.
Yes. He used our emergency
code Tango Zebra.
"Heading North Africa, Palmyra."
Palmyra? Where is that?
Haven't a clue, sir.
Well, find out about it, will you?
I'll do my best, sir.
North Africa?
Quite impressive, huh?
Very.
That's my retreat, where I can
escape and enjoy all my treasures.
How do you like your new home, my princess?
Bond, the game is over. Take him away.
That belonged to Napoleon's empress.
That is my greatest treasure.
Take it. Take it. But be careful.
That is your wedding present.
You betrayed me.
But I forgive you.
And what about my brother?
Your brother...
I hate you. I hate you.
Domino! Domino!
You're crazy.
Yeah, maybe I'm crazy.
What a wonderful view.
You'll see.
Every game has to have a winner.
So... Ciao bello.
Largo.
Bond.
In that case, where did you hide the bombs?
You still think of escape?
I must say, I admire your spirit.
Well,
bomb number one is right
under the President's feet
in Washington DC.
And number two?
You were a very good secret agent. Really.
Bye.
I'm sure this will amuse you.
Goodbye, Domino.
Cover it up.
Hold on.
What are you doing?
James!
Bond, you're a hard man to keep up with.
Clear the line to Washington, Felix.
That's where the first bomb is.
It was never like this
when I was in the Navy.
Here we are.
What's the matter?
You're going back after Largo, aren't you?
Well, I have to.
I want him as much as you do.
Probably more.
I can understand you hating him.
Maybe I don't hate him
enough to risk losing you.
But I don't want to risk losing me, either.
Commander Bond, the Washington
bomb has been located and defused.
Now, sir, from London, your
chief wants to speak to you.
This is M. We've cracked the
code for disarming the warheads,
but we've only got five hours
to find the second bomb.
Now, as you perfectly well know,
I have absolute confidence in you, and I...
That's what kept me going, sir.
Bond, all right, then,
I'll be brief with you.
And I know you've got your hands full.
If you should come through
this fearful ordeal unscathed,
I'd like to offer you
lunch at my club. Over.
That's a thrilling prospect, sir.
But if I do get through this,
I may have other plans.
Steady at 300.
Steady at 300.
There she is, sir.
What's she reading?
Seven fathoms, sir.
No way we can get in there.
The water's too shallow.
Nothing. Nothing moving on board.
AWAC surveillance reports
no sightings on shore.
Now why did Largo anchor here?
Your pendant. Give it to me.
This is The Tears of Allah.
The story goes that the Prophet
wept, and his tears made a well.
The contours are the same.
The diamond must mark a place.
That would be about here.
Right where the oilfields begin.
Sir, there is underwater
activity in the area.
Check the area for underwater caves.
Right, sir.
Sonar signals do indicate
a cavity below sea level
at 015 degrees.
There's an underground river right there.
Commander Pederson, are you
equipped with the new XT-7Bs?
That's top secret. How
do you know about them?
From a Russian translation of
one of your service manuals.
Sorry about that.
Ports open. Fire one.
Fire two. Cut track.
Be careful of the housing.
Watch it.
I've got to go in.
We don't have much time.
Give the sub our position
and get some help.
All right.
Kovacs? Kovacs? Come.
You're not in the right place. Please.
Well done, Dr. Kovacs.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
When the warhead is ready for its
final voyage, we will drink a toast.
There is nothing that can stop us anymore.
The guide rope. Keep the tension.
The Tears of Allah.
Sweet, like money.
For centuries, this has
been a monument to power,
but nothing like what we now possess.
Huh, Kovacs?
Everybody stay undercover!
You, get up there!
Leiter, stay down!
What took you so long?
Hold up on the heavy stuff!
Bond is still in there!
It's armed.
Largo got away with the warhead.
Call down a chopper.
I'm going to try the oasis. Good luck.
Bond's clear! We're moving in!
There you are.
I always have a martini at 5:00.
You'll never give up
your old habits, James.
No, you're wrong. Those days are over.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bond.
Obviously caught you at a bad moment.
M sent you.
Only to plead for your return, sir.
M says that without you in the service,
he fears for the security
of the civilized world.
Never again.
Never?
Never say never again.
Never, never say never again.
You walk in a room.
A woman can feel the heat.
One look is a guarantee.
Nights could be long and sweet.
The message is clear.
Like nothing I've ever known.
But from all that I hear.
Forget about long-range plans.
'Cause this man's got his own.
To get mixed up with.
A man who says never.
May be big trouble, but then
I just could be the woman to take you.
And make you never say never again.
Never, never say never again.
Never, never say never again.
Never, never say never again.
Never, never say never again.
You've got all the moves.
Oh, but, baby, I got them, too.
No matter your attitude or your mood
I'll come through.
The touch of your voice.
The feel of your eyes on me.
You leave me no choice.
Though I know there's danger there
I don't care, let it be.
To get in bed with.
A man who says never.
May have no future, but then
I just could be the woman to reach you.
And teach you to never say never again
I'll beg you I'll get you
I'll reach you I'll teach you
I'll take you I'll make you

(speaks Russian)
(shouts from below)

(beeping intensifies)
(distant shouting)
(cocks gun)
Aaaii! (rants)
(distant shouts)
(California Girls by the Beach Boys)
Aauughh!
(panicked cries)
(muffled cries)
I thought you'd never get back.
There was a heck of a crowd on the piste.
So I see.
- Mission accomplished?
- Best Beluga.
Vodka - rather shaken - and one microchip.
Good. I'll make a signal to M.
Be a good girl, would you,
and put her on automatic.
And we could do with a couple of glasses.
They're in the overhead rack.
(engine roars)
Commander Bond!
Call me James. It's five days to Alaska.
Meeting you
With a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places
Feel the chill
Nightfall covers me
But you know the plans I'm making
Still oversee
Could it be the whole earth opening wide?
A sacred why
A mystery gaping inside
The weekends why
Until we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
Choice for you
Is the view to a kill
Between the shades
Assassination standing still
First crystal tears
Fall as snowflakes on your body
First time in years
To drench your skin with lovers' rosy stain
A chance to find a phoenix for the flame
A chance to die
But can we dance into the fire?
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
When all we see
Is the view to a kill
- Thank goodness you're here, James.
- That's very nice, Moneypenny.
A little over the top for the office?
I've been trying to reach you all morning.
What have you been up to?
Rest and recreation, my darling.
The trip back from Siberia
took a lot out of me.
Your dedication when you're on the job
is most commendable, James.
Omit the customary pleasantries,
Miss Moneypenny. We're pressed for time.
I'll... fill you in later, Moneypenny.
Aahh!
- Minister.
- Commander.
Good morning, sir.
A new pet, Q?
If, 007, you'd ever bothered to read
any memos sent from my department,
you would realise this is a prototype
of a sophisticated surveillance machine.
Now we're all here
you can get on with the briefing, Q.
Very good, sir.
Gentlemen...
A silicon integrated circuit:
The essential part of all modern computers.
No lecture, Q.
We're all aware of the microchip.
Until recently, all microchips
were susceptible to damage
from the intense magnetic pulse
of a nuclear explosion.
- Magnetic pulse?
- Yes, Minister.
One burst in outer space over the UK
and everything with a microchip in it,
from the modern toaster to sophisticated
computers and our defence systems,
would be rendered useless.
We'd be paralysed - at the Russians' mercy.
That is why a private defence
contractor came up with this:
A chip totally impervious
to magnetic pulse damage.
Now - if I place it on the micro-comparator
and compare it with
the chip Bond recovered
from the body of 003 in Siberia...
- When I bring the two images together...
- They're identical.
The KGB must have a pipeline
into that research company.
It would appear so.
Six months ago that company was
acquired by an Anglo-French combine:
Zorin Industries.
There has been a security
check of the plant?
A very extensive one. But we have no leads.
What about Zorin himself?
Max Zorin? Lmpossible.
He's a leading French industrialist.
A staunch anti-communist with
influential friends in the government.
With due respect, Minister,
the leak did occur
after Zorin bought the company.
Precisely why I've initiated an investigation.
All right, but let's be discreet about it.
But of course, Minister.
You have exactly 35 minutes
to get properly dressed, 007.
(race commentator) They round the turn.
Just under a mile to race from this point.
Come on, Fluke! Move your ar...
- Who is number one? The grey with him?
- Oh, that's Pegasus. Zorin's horse.
With the cane. Max Zorin?
Yes. Born in Dresden.
Fled from East Germany in the sixties.
French passport.
Speaks at least five languages, no accent.
Now the talk of the City and the Bourse.
- The old rags-to-riches story.
- Made his first fortune in oil and gas.
Now a second in electronics and hi-tech.
Who's that with him under the hat?
With the red dress. A girlfriend?
Oh.
We're not sure about her.
American. She's never far from him.
Name's May Day.
(Bond) And dressed for the occasion.
(Moneypenny) Come on, Fluke!
Get a wiggle on!
(commentator) Pegasus has come from
nowhere, and as they go for the line
it's Pegasus who storms clear
off Fluke and Cooper Girl.
(announcer) First, number one; second,
number two; and third, number five.
First number one, Pegasus;
second number two, Fluke;
and third number five, Cooper Girl.
Unbelievable! In all my years as a trainer
I've never seen a horse
run such a fast last furlong.
Sir Godfrey Tibbett. Our department.
- Many congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Lucky man, Zorin.
- Could be more than luck, Admiral.
- Fixed?
- Your guess is as good as mine.
The French Jockey Club have hired
a detective, Aubergine, to look into it.
(May Day) Easy, Pegasus.
Calm down, Pegasus.
Easy. Steady, steady.
She must take a lot of vitamins.
Perhaps Pegasus does too.
I think I should meet with
this detective friend of yours.
Yes. Might have some interesting
information for us. Set it up, David.
Right you are.
Moneypenny - be a darling, would you,
and collect that for me.
- I'll buy you dinner when we get back.
- Pegasus!
Bollinger, '75.
I see you are a connoisseur, Monsieur Bond.
- Ensuite, Lafite Rothschild '59.
- Another excellent choice.
I'm pleased you approve -
since you're paying the bill.
- Cheers.
- Sant, Monsieur Aubergine.
The Sret has no information on Zorin
before he came over from East Germany?
Through a personal connection
I saw his dossier myself.
But even Sret records
are sometimes incomplete!
(Flamenco guitar intro)
Et voici maintenant the fabulous
Dominique and the enchanted papillons!
(Dominique whistles bittersweet tune)
Perhaps we should add this
butterfly to our collection, no?
Tell me, why do Zorin's horses
beat others with superior bloodlines?
This is a mystery.
- Could he be using drugs?
- Nothing showed up in the tests.
Later this month, Zorin will hold his
annual sales at his stud near Paris.
Security is formidable
but the key to this mystery is there.
And I, Achille Aubergine, intend to find it.
Uunnhh!
(woman screams)
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a?
- There's a fly in his soup.
Pardonnez-moi, monsieur.
(engine whirs)
- Taxi!
- Je ne suis pas en service.
- Follow that parachute.
- Crazy English!
Out.
My car!
My car! Ohh!
(sounds horn)
Sens unique, fada!
(band plays jazz number)
- Congratulations.
- (outraged cries)
So?
This operation was to be
conducted discreetly.
It took six million francs
in damages and penalties
for violating most of the Napoleonic Code.
Under the circumstances it was
more important to identify the assassin.
What did you learn from Aubergine
before his demise?
Only that Zorin is having a thoroughbred
sale at his stud not far from here.
I should be there.
- Can you help me, Sir Godfrey?
- I may be able to arrange an invitation.
It's a bit short notice...
but I might just be able to squeeze you in.
Thank you.
Sir Godfrey, your hat.
Mr St John Smith?
SIN-jun Smythe, my dear.
- My name is Scarpine. Head of security.
- How do you do.
- We have a room for you at the chateau.
- Oh, splendid.
By the way, the preview is in progress
at the main stables.
- Is that it?
- No, no, those are the servants' quarters.
The stables are over here.
Let me escort you there.
(auctioneer describes horses on Tannoy)
- Catalogue of the sales.
- Thank you.
Tell me - the lthacus colt. Is it here?
- You mean the full brother of Pegasus?
- Yes.
He's the outstanding horse of the sales.
He'll be shown last. We expect him
to fetch over three million dollars.
Sounds quite reasonable.
If you need any further assistance
please call me.
Thank you.
Steady! Steady, Pegasus, steady.
Keep him on a tight rein!
- (neighs)
- Steady now, Pegasus. Steady.
- (groom #1) J'arrive dans un instant.
- (groom #2) Dpche-toi.
(auctioneer) We are now very proud to
present the full brother of Pegasus.
This colt is born in the purple.
Monsieur Smythe.
MonsieurZorin has been detained.
He's anxious to meet you at the
reception in the chateau gardens later.
I look forward to it.
- I wish you wouldn't keep wandering off.
- I'm sorry, sir.
Your driver may stay
in the servants' quarters.
I'm sure that'll be more than adequate.
What do you say, Tibbett?
Ahem!
- Welcome, sir. I'm Jenny Flex.
- Of course you are.
- I'll call a porter.
- Oh, no need. My man'll take care of it.
- Let me show you to your room.
- Thank you.
When you're ready, Tibbett.
Well, my dear, I take it you spend
a lot of time in the saddle.
- Yes, I love an early morning ride.
- I'm an early riser myself.
Come along, Tibbett. Stop wheezing.
Whew!
Don't stand there panting, Tibbett.
Start unpacking.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
- The reception is at six.
- Thank you, my dear.
Well, you heard what Miss Jenny Flex
said: There is a reception at six.
- Yes, sir.
- So I need a white jacket and a black tie.
Yes, sir. (bleeping)
- And if possible, a clean shirt.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, my Lord, Tibbett!
Look at the state of my clothes.
- How on earth do you pack my bags?
- Sorry, sir.
Mr Faras told his trainer
he'll go to a million for the lthacus colt.
- Good. Anything from St John Smythe?
- Nothing about the sale, sir.
- But I'd hate to be his valet.
- You'll have to buck up your ideas.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Don't be so damned obsequious.
(bleeping intensifies)
Oh, my Lord.
What the devil's wrong with these shoes?
- Were they wiped over with an oily rag?
- Terribly sorry, sir.
You blasted well should be.
I don't know how long
you expect to remain in my employ...
- Well done, my good man.
- Must we keep this up when we're alone?
A successful cover becomes
almost second nature.
What's all this about Pegasus disappearing?
One minute he's in his stall -
the next, neither hide nor hair of him.
- We should look into it.
- (chopper)
Well, don't you concern yourself with that.
There's the man I saw at the Pegasus stable.
- Another wealthy owner?
- Who knows?
- But she'd bear closer inspection.
- We're on a mission.
Sir Godfrey, on a mission
I am expected to sacrifice myself.
Lovely party.
Enjoying our little party,
Monsieur... St John Smythe?
Immensely, immensely. SIN-jun Smythe.
Looks as though you'll have
a good turnout for the sale tomorrow.
May I introduce Miss Sutton?
Sheikh Farouk.
- Welcome.
- Mr Zorin. Main Strike all set?
We'll know after the 22nd.
- Thank you.
- Enjoy yourself.
You were looking for something?
Yes, I... I was looking for the bar.
Come. I will show you.
Oh, by the way, the name is
St John Smythe. James St John Smythe.
Dr Carl Mortner. At your service.
- Hiya, doc!
- Good afternoon, Mr Conley.
Mr Conley, Mr Smythe.
Bob Conley.
- Are you a trainer?
- Horses? Hell, I can't even ride.
- I'm in the oil business.
- Oh. Texas? (shutter clicks)
Frisco. I handle Mr Zorin's
oil interests there.
Would you excuse us? Come on, honey.
Are you a doctor of medicine?
Oh, no, no.
I am Mr Zorin's breeding consultant.
Oh, really?
Then you can let me into a little secret.
How is it you succeed with breeding
bloodlines other experts think inferior?
Selective breeding is important.
But more important
is conditioning and a desire, ja?
Are you talking about
people or horses? (shutter clicks)
My principles apply equally
to human beings.
Mr St John Smythe.
Allow me to introduce myself.
Mr Zorin, it's a great pleasure.
- A groom asked if you'd go to the stables.
- Of course.
You will excuse me?
I must congratulate you, Mr Zorin.
Your stables are magnificent.
Built in the 16th century by a duke who
believed he'd be reincarnated as a horse.
Have thoroughbreds interested you long?
Oh, no. As a matter of fact I had a dotty
old aunt die and leave me some stables.
So I thought it might be rather fun
to breed and raise horses.
- I take it you ride?
- I'm happiest in the saddle.
A fellow-sportsman.
What about fishing?
Fly casting?
I'm neglecting my other guests. You'll find
the young ladies stimulating company.
I'm sure they are.
Hello. I thought you might
like to join the party.
By the way, the name is
James St John Smythe. I'm English.
Hmm. I never would have guessed.
Really?
Monsieur.
Well, are you buying or selling?
- Selling?
- Horses.
Oh.
No, I'm not interested in horses.
Well, you came to the wrong place,
didn't you?
May Day.
Get her away from him.
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before.
Have Security keep a good eye on him.
You didn't say what part
of the States you come from, Miss...
No. I didn't.
I suppose you... travel a lot?
Your helicopter leaves in 20 minutes.
You're not staying the night? I was hoping
we'd spend the evening together.
Now I shall be all alone.
I doubt that.
- Well, let me walk you to the chopper.
- That won't be necessary.
- Someone will take care of you.
- You'll see to that personally, will you?
- (muffled cry)
- Shhh!
Are you looking for this?
Quite a letdown.
- St John Smythe?
- Sleeping like a baby.
(snoring)
That's a boy.
There we are.
It's interesting. He's had surgery.
Surgery? That is how Zorin won the race.
Mortner implanted one of
these microchips into Pegasus.
You see, these microchips are
programmed to control an injection
of additional natural horse steroids.
- To overcome fatigue during the race.
- How?
The injection itself, with that small needle,
is triggered by a remote-control transmitter
small enough to fit into
the tip of a jockey's whip
or a cane.
The lights!
There's a world surplus of microchips
and Zorin is hoarding them!
(whir of machinery)
- Dis donc, on va voir ce qui se passe?
- D'accord.
(whirring)
- I'm afraid I wasn't much help.
- Don't worry. It's all wrapped up.
Keep your guard up higher.
And retain your balance.
(muffled shouts)
- Aiiii!
- Oof!
- What now?
- We'd better get back.
The tape ran out five minutes ago.
(phone rings)
I told you not to disturb us.
(Scarpine) It's important.
There's been intruders in the warehouse.
Put Security on full alert.
Let's see where Mr St John Smythe is.
He was the man at the Eiffel Tower.
- We must find him.
- I'll get dressed.
(Bond) May Day, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.
To take care of me personally.
I see you're a woman of very few words.
What's there to say?
- Is everything here?
- Ja, ja.
Except this.
It is in the wrong place.
Bring St John Smythe to my study
first thing in the morning.
- (Bond) Good morning.
- Good morning.
I understand you wish to see me.
- You slept well?
- A little restless, but I got off eventually.
I have the Progeny Index on the computer:
A compilation of
thoroughbred bloodlines.
Might be helpful to you in selecting
your purchase this afternoon.
As I see it, you need a stallion. For breeding.
A stallion sounds right to me.
I find a computer indispensable.
I have a stallion.
Descended from that horse there.
Misty.
We have several horses
that might interest you.
Would you be interested
primarily in stamina?
- Or speed?
- Well, a little of both would be ideal.
I think I have just the horse for you.
(clock chimes)
It's time for my morning ride.
- Why don't you try him out?
- That sounds a very good idea.
- I shall get into some riding clothes.
- Good.
Half an hour, then. Scarpine will collect you.
Thank you.
(hums)
Tibbett, get into town, call M
and ask him to put a trace on this cheque.
Be quick. If those guards we laid out
identify us we'll have to move fast.
What shall I say if they ask where I'm going?
Just tell them
you have to get the car washed.
Just going to town to get the car washed.
- Your mount, Mr St John Smythe.
- A beautiful beast.
A little spirited. What's his name?
Inferno.
(neighs)
Merci.
- Friends of yours?
- Exercise boys.
Jumping together is more realistic training.
Frankly, I prefer cross-country
to steeplechase.
As one sportsman to another,
I'll make you a proposition.
You can have that lthacus colt gratis
if you stay this course.
- And if I'm thrown?
- Then you lose.
You leave me little choice.
Splendid. Scarpine will start us.
(neighs)
Steady!
Keep going! Keep going!
Sir Godfrey. Let's get...
You lost, 007.
- Killing Tibbett was a mistake.
- I'm about to make the same one twice.
My department know I'm here.
They'll retaliate.
If you're the best they have,
they'll more likely try
to cover up your incompetence.
Don't count on it, Zorin.
- You amuse me, Mr Bond.
- Well, it's not mutual.
Other side.
Open up.
- Good morning, Comrade Zorin.
- General Gogol.
- This meeting is ill-advised.
- A calculated risk.
But necessary,
as you refuse to answer your control.
Come to the point, General.
You disregard procedure.
You did not request approval
before eliminating 007.
- Reprisals might jeopardise operations.
- You jeopardise mine!
Letting the British penetrate
the Siberian research centre.
That was regrettable.
Your racing activities
attract unnecessary attention,
but more disturbing are your
unauthorised commercial ventures.
We cannot tolerate that.
The issue is irrelevant.
I've made new associations.
I no longer consider myself a KGB agent.
We trained you. Financed you. Huh!
What would you be without us?
A biological experiment. A freak.
Enough of this! Control yourselves!
You will come back to us, Comrade.
No one ever leaves the KGB.
Gentlemen.
For centuries alchemists
tried to make gold from base metals.
Today we make microchips
from silicon, which is common sand.
- But far better than gold, hm?
- (laughter)
For several years we've had
a profitable partnership:
You as manufacturers, while I passed on
to you industrial information
that made you competitive, successful.
We are now in the unique position
to form an international cartel
to control not only production
but distribution of these microchips.
There is one obstacle.
Silicon Valley.
Near San Francisco.
Over 250 plants employing
thousands of scientists, technicians.
This is the heartland of electronic
production in the United States,
which accounts for what -
80% of the world microchip market.
I propose to end
the domination of Silicon Valley
- and leave us in control of that market.
- What is it you propose?
Project Main Strike.
For which, each of you will pay me
one hundred million dollars.
A hundred million dollars?
Plus half our net income?
Under an exclusive
marketing agreement with me.
These are outrageous terms!
Perhaps a demonstration
would convince you.
- I want no part of it, thank you.
- As you wish. Hmph!
The rest of our discussion
must of course be confidential.
- Would you wait outside?
- If you'd like me to, yes. Excuse me.
May Day will provide you with a drink.
This way.
Aaagghhh!
So, does anybody else want to drop out?
(voices on intercom)
Wow!
What a view!
To a kill.
Five dollars.
Thank you.
- Looking for something special?
- Yes. Soft-shell crabs.
Might have some in the back.
I'll be a few minutes.
Chuck Lee, CIA.
It's a pleasure working with 007.
- Thanks. Now what about Zorin?
- He's in town. I can have him tailed.
No, not yet.
Conley is a geologist. Runs Zorin's
oil reclamation project in the East Bay.
Last job: Chief engineer
in a South African gold mine.
Left in a hurry
after a cave-in killed 20 miners.
Zorin's kind of man!
What about the girl? And the cheque?
You know how many S Suttons
there are in the US?
We watch Zorin's account.
The cheque hasn't been cashed.
- Mortner?
- Got a real winner here.
His real name is Hans Glaub, a German
pioneer in the development of steroids.
That ties in with the horse injections.
In the war he used steroids on pregnant
women in the concentration camps
in an attempt to enhance intelligence.
- With any success?
- Virtually every mother aborted.
A handful of children
were produced with phenomenal IQs.
But there was a side-effect:
They were psychotics.
Why wasn't this Mortner or Glaub
tried by the War Crimes Commission?
The Russians grabbed him.
Set him up in a laboratory.
He spent years developing steroids for
their athletes, then vanished 15 years ago.
About the same time
Zorin came over to the West.
Could Zorin be one of the steroid kids?
He's definitely the right age,
and he's certainly psychotic.
What about his oil operations?
Mr O'Rourke!
Aye!
- Can you spare a minute?
- Sure thing.
The oil operation looks clean, except
for a problem with the crab fishermen.
Good morning.
Here's that reporter I told you about.
Mr O'Rourke.
I understand you have a problem.
That Zorin oil pumping station ruined
one of the best crab patches in the Bay.
Scared them away?
They didn't go nowhere.
They just disappeared.
Well, I'd like to look at
that oil pumping station.
That'll be tough. It's very heavily guarded.
We'll be testing new equipment shortly.
Keep a sharp lookout.
- I don't want anyone near this dock.
- Very good, sir.
- Valves 5 to 15 are open.
- What's the report from the wells?
(female technician)
Valves open and ready to receive water.
Good. Open valves 16 to 25.
(male technician)
Valve 10 at half capacity, sir.
Give me an update on valve procedure
for the Main Strike programme.
(Conley) We'll have a field crew
check it out in the morning.
(mesh rattles)
- Valves to wells 26 to 30 open, sir.
- Right.
Activate pumping procedure.
50 per cent power.
Increase it.
Maximum.
The new seals are not fully tested.
Main Strike's in three days. Any delays,
I hold you responsible.
Yes, sir.
Bring it up to full. Slowly.
(engine fires up)
- Shut down! The propeller's jammed.
- Fix it.
(alarm sounds)
- You there! Get a man down there!
- (mutters orders urgently)
Let's go, move. Come on, you guys.
Gimme a hand.
- Get the alarms turned off.
- Yes, sir.
(Conley) Hurry up, goddammit!
Clear that pump.
We're behind schedule.
Give it to me.
(May Day) Ha!
Guard!
(men call out in Russian)
(Zorin) Tell Conley to resume pumping.
This is yours, I believe.
Defuse it.
(engines whine)
(cries out)
(desperate cries)
Aaaggghhh!
(pants)
Well!
- Pola lvanova!
- James Bond!
- Check the beach area.
- Let's get out of here.
(traditional Japanese music)
(Pola) That feels wonderful!
Feels even better from where I'm sitting.
- Would you like it harder?
- James, you haven't changed.
Well, you have.
You're even lovelier.
James, that night in London
when I was with the Bolshoi...
What a performance!
In my dressing room later...
Did you know I was an agent
with orders to seduce you?
Why do you think I sent you
three dozen red roses?
Now that was a performance.
Quite a coincidence,
us running into one another!
- Come on, tell me the truth.
- Let's not talk shop.
Let's put on something more...
- inspirational.
- Why not?
(turns off music)
- Ohh!
- (music)
Are you all right?
The bubbles tickle my...
Tchaikovsky!
Dtente can be beautiful.
This is no time to be discussing politics.
(music from Swan Lake)
Pola?
Yes, darling?
You know something? Tomorrow
I shall buy you six dozen red roses.
How lovely, darling. I can't wait.
(car engine starts)
The tape?
(traditional Japanese music)
(Zorin) The Silicon Valley operation
must not be delayed.
(tape rewinds)
Main Strike's in three days.
Any delays, I hold you responsible.
It's essential the remaining pipelines
are open on time.
Our economy needs investors like Mr Zorin.
California welcomes him with open arms.
- May I quote you on that, Mr Howe?
- Certainly.
Is there anything else I can tell
the Financial Times?
Yes. My readers want to know why Zorin
is pumping sea water into his pipeline
instead of pumping oil out.
Sea water is used to test
the integrity of the pipeline.
It's a lot safer than oil.
Just in case there are any leaks.
Well, I... I didn't know that.
Well, thank you, Mr Howe.
That about wraps it up.
Would you come this way, please?
If you'd like any further information
just call me, Mr...
Stock. James Stock. Thank you, Mr Howe.
- Mr Howe!
- Stacey, what do you want?
I have some porosity tests
I want to show you.
- I can only spare a couple of minutes.
- OK.
(man) Ahem!
Sorry.
(presenter reads weather forecast on radio)
(radio programme continues)
(bleeps)
(water running)
(yowls)
(water running)
(cocks gun) Come out real slow.
Just another Zorin stooge, Mr...
whatever your name was.
Actually, it's James Stock.
London Financial Times.
You can, uh... You can tell the police which.
And you can tell them about the $5
million payoff you received from Zorin.
I saw the cheque.
You cut the line.
Get back.
Sit down.
(gunshot)
- What's this loaded with?
- Rock salt.
Now you tell me.
(Stacey) No!
The vase! No!
Take this.
Oh, hell!
Sorry, Granddad.
Hey, wait for me!
(door shuts)
Thank you.
My pleasure.
All the king's horses and all his men
won't do much with that.
That's all right. It was Granddad's ashes.
But he always loved a good fight.
I'm Stacey. Sutton.
- Yes.
- And... you're a reporter.
- What was it?
- Stock. James Stock.
- Right.
- Yes, I'm researching an article on Zorin.
I used a friend's name
to get an invitation to the chateau.
I can tell you a few things about Zorin.
- I'd like to hear them.
- (cat meows)
I have to feed him. Are you hungry?
- What are you serving? Whiskas?
- I only have leftovers in the fridge.
- I'm a pathetic cook.
- I'll lend a hand.
- You can cook?
- I've been known to dabble.
Et voil! Quiche de cabinet.
Sounds interesting. What is it?
An omelette.
Now, you were telling me
about your grandfather.
He left Sutton Oil to Dad - who expected
me, as the only child, to take it over.
- So at college I studied geology.
- And then what happened?
Zorin. He took over Sutton Oil
in a rigged proxy fight.
I fought him in the courts.
It's taken all I had.
All the cash, the furniture, everything.
So I took this job as state geologist
and I've just managed
to hold on to the house and my shares.
And that's what the $5 million were for?
Your shares?
Ten times more than they're worth. Just...
Just drop the lawsuit and shut my mouth.
I haven't accepted yet.
So Zorin sent along his gorillas
to help you make up your mind.
They have. (rips up cheque)
I'd sell everything and live in a tent
before I give up.
That was delicious.
And the way you handled those men.
Well, those...
baboons could come back.
I hope not.
Well, then, I'll...
check the windows and doors, and...
- Oh! Reconnect the telephone.
- The box is outside my bedroom window.
I think I should be able to find that.
(rumbling)
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Oh, I say! Breakfast out of bed.
- What's wrong with them?
- We had an earth tremor.
They're extremely sensitive
to seismic activity.
Let's see what
the Earthquake Center has on it.
Just a minor tremor. Measured 2.5
on the Richter scale. Location...
That's odd.
The epicentre's near Zorin's oil field.
I told Howe yesterday that Zorin
was pumping sea water into his wells.
- Is there a connection?
- Sea water?
Those wells are in the Hayward fault.
- Are you sure?
- I checked it myself.
That's incredibly dangerous.
Howe has to stop Zorin now.
(raised voices)
- What happened?
- I got fired.
- He fire... He fired me.
- All right. Calm down.
This evening we'll meet
a friend of mine from Washington.
Maybe, just maybe,
he'll come up with a few answers.
I wish we could be more specific about
Zorin's intentions before I go to the top.
Flooding a fault
could cause a major earthquake.
But what would Zorin have to gain?
On the tape Zorin mentioned Silicon Valley.
Could that be affected?
No, not severely.
Silicon Valley's too far away.
But if we knew how many wells were
involved... we might get a clearer picture.
That information's available at City Hall.
- I still have my security pass.
- Then let's go to City Hall.
- Let me go and get it.
- I'll tell Washington we need more help.
Don't waste any time. There's only 24 hours.
(car radio comes on with engine)
(faint music from car)
- Good evening, Jeff.
- Evening, ma'am.
- Won't be long.
- OK.
- Main Strike.
- Hey, I know that place.
That's an abandoned silver mine
by the San Andreas fault.
(gasps)
Alive and well, I see.
And still bungling in the dark.
Well, then,
why don't you enlighten me, Zorin?
You're out of your depth.
And you, Sutton. You should have
accepted my more than generous offer.
- You can take your offer and shove it.
- Don't bother, Stacey.
He's a psychopath.
You two have joined forces?
- That simplifies things.
- He's probably armed.
Stacey, I...
Mr Zorin.
Call the police, Mr Howe.
- What's going on?
- Tell them... there's been a break-in.
Ask them to get here as soon as possible.
You're being used, Mr Howe.
Do it.
- Police.
- Hello.
We've had a break-in here.
- City Hall, office 306. Come at once.
- Right away.
- What have they done?
- You discharged her.
So she and her accomplice
came here to kill you.
Then they set fire to the office
to conceal the crime,
but they were trapped in the elevator.
And perished in the flames.
But that means I would have to be...
Dead.
That's rather neat. Don't you think?
Brilliant.
I'm almost speechless with admiration.
Intuitive improvisation
is the secret of genius.
Herr Doktor Mortner
will be proud of his creation.
Please.
Get back.
(Stacey cries out)
- Out.
- Let's go.
Get back!
(fire alarm sounds)
(cables creak)
(creaking)
Hold tight.
Come on, Stacey.
Give me your hand. Stretch!
Stretch!
Don't go away.
James, don't leave me!
James! (coughs)
Help me!
James! (coughs)
Help me! Help me!
James!
I'll be right with you.
Help! Help!
- (woman) It is the City Hall.
- (man) I'll call the fire department.
(sirens and horns)
Try and come this side of the girder.
- Catch this.
- I can't reach it!
Come on. Catch!
- Now... push!
- (screams)
(horn)
- (Stacey pants)
- Go on.
Good girl. You're nearly there.
Go on, stretch!
(Stacey coughs)
(screams)
(sirens)
Get this TV crew outta here, will ya?
Come on. Get outta my way.
(coughs)
(woman) All we know is that there are
people trapped inside of City Hall.
(officer) Come on. Back off, will ya?
Let us through, goddammit.
Give her some air.
Comin' through. Out of the way, please.
Stacey. Stacey, you're safe.
Let me through.
Let me through, goddammit.
I wanna talk to you.
Captain. If you can get to
Howe's office you'll find him dead.
We found him - and this gun. This yours?
- Yes, thanks.
- Turn around.
If you check with Chuck Lee of the CIA,
he'll inform you who I am.
- We found his body in Chinatown.
- What?
- You're under arrest.
- Wait.
This is James Stock
of the London Financial Times.
Actually I'm with the British Secret Service.
The name is Bond. James Bond.
- Is he?
- Are you?
Yes.
And I'm Dick Tracy
and you're still under arrest.
Get in here.
Hey, where's that guy goin'?
That ladder's unlocked.
Is that true what you said
about the British secret service?
Yes, I'm afraid it is.
My real name is Bond. James Bond.
You must take my word for it.
(siren comes on)
Put your hand on this.
The wheel! Take over. Put your foot on here.
James, where are you going?
(police chief) To all units. Intercept
murder suspect in stolen fire truck.
He may be armed and he's sure dangerous.
- Pull away you idiots.
- I can't. The fenders are locked!
- I told you, they're locked!
- Oh, my God, watch out!
Ohhh!
(horn)
- Jeez!
- Turn!
Not this way. That way!
Shit!
Ohhhh!
- Swing me back!
- Oh, jeez!
Drive on!
- I think I can get him.
- Go for it!
(yells)
That should keep them on the wrong track.
(phone rings)
Hello.
Raise the bridge? Right now?
Yes, sir!
I got him. Oh, jeez, I got him!
(horn)
Keep going, keep going!
(alarm sounds)
(officer) Oh, my God!
Hey, watch out! Get out of the way!
Jesus!
Oh, mother! I... I...
Holy shit!
Move it!
Harris...
Forget about that sergeant promotion.
You'll have to pay for this vehicle.
100 bucks a month out of your paycheck.
(metal buckling)
Oh, no!
Wake up. We're there.
There's a lot of activity
for an abandoned mine.
That truckload of explosives
should last them for months.
Here comes next year's supply.
Get down.
(siren on)
- Where's the fire?
- On your rear end.
Give me a hand.
Hey!
Gerry...
- It's the rules. Hard hat area.
- Thanks.
Follow the signs.
Move it. You're late!
You two, come here.
Give us a hand unloading this.
OK, leave it there.
Get a coffee over at the hut.
Come back in 20 minutes.
It's women's lib.
They're taking over the Teamsters.
OK, get this stuff movin'!
We're an hour late.
I should take a closer look at that mine.
(Stacey) Ahem!
What's stopping you?
That's a good idea of yours.
Pity you couldn't find one that fits.
Why walk when you can ride?
Keep it coming, keep it coming.
OK, let's go.
Will you keep still!
Do you know what I'm sitting on?
I'm trying not to think about it.
(Tannoy) Stand clear. Stand clear.
All personnel not on essential duties,
leave underground area immediately.
Standby crew, we need you up here.
Ready to unload.
OK, stand clear.
Let's go, standby crew.
Break off. Stand clear.
Standby forward. Bring the gag
up here and clear these barriers away.
(Conley) Come on, let's go.
We haven't got all day.
Clear the safety barrier.
(Conley) Come on, move!
Hey, on the crane!
Swing the cradle over here.
Take it off. Take it off.
(ticking)
Bring it over. Bring it over. Easy.
Good, good.
(Conley continues instructions)
- You found anything?
- Yes. I think I have.
Good.
Good. Hold 'em.
OK, get those wedges in there tight!
(foreman) Come on,
lay the head down here. OK?
The San Andreas Lake is right above us.
Lots of seepage. Could flood any minute.
Finish shoring up the roof.
I'll send the lug back.
OK.
Bring up some timber, on the double!
(Stacey) He'll kill millions.
These green lights - they're Zorin's oil wells.
The ones he's been using to pump
sea water into the Hayward fault.
What are these tunnels for
under these lakes?
These lead straight into this section
of the San Andreas fault.
Zorin just has to blast through the
bottom of these lakes to flood the fault.
- And create a... double earthquake?
- Yes. Except...
Except right beneath us
is the key geological lock
that keeps the faults from moving at once.
Hey, let's go!
All those explosives.
Would they be enough to break the lock?
Of course!
If they go off, both faults move at once.
Silicon Valley and everything in it
submerged for ever.
If it happened at the peak of
the spring tide for maximum effect...
That's today at 9.41. In less than an hour!
- We have to go and warn people.
- Wait!
Stand back.
Jump!
(klaxon)
Get him.
- Get 'em back to work.
- You men, get back to work.
It's Bond.
Close up the entrance. Nobody gets out.
Hold it!
In.
Aagghh!
Come on.
- Did you pass anyone back there?
- No. I saw no one.
- Now which way?
- The map.
There's a draught from up there.
- It must be a ventilation shaft.
- Wait!
(Stacey gasps)
That must lead to the fault.
The water from the lakes!
Yes. And it'll be flooding any moment.
Come on.
You two, that way.
Give me your hand.
It's time to flood the fault.
But... May Day. And my men.
Yeah. A convenient coincidence.
Mr Zorin, those men are loyal to you.
(gasps)
Hurry!
- Get help. Quick!
- Get a doctor.
Aauugghh!
(Stacey screams)
(panicked cries)
(worker) Come on, run for your life!
(workers attend Conley)
Give me some spare clips.
Keep climbing!
Keep going!
James!
Good. Right on schedule.
Let's go.
(Zorin chuckles)
And I thought that creep loved me!
You're not the only one he double-crossed.
All outboard valves fully locked, sir.
The water level's dropping.
Pump pressure good.
(May Day gasps) Jenny!
Come on. There's nothing
you can do for them now.
- Up and away!
- (Zorin cackles)
(Zorin) Silicon Valley. Perfect!
Hold position here.
Only minutes more, Carl.
Nothing can stop it now.
The greatest cataclysm in history.
And all attributed to natural causes.
Exactly.
We must hurry.
I have to get down
and defuse that detonator.
You can't. The time has been booby trapped.
If you tamper with it we're going to blow up.
Then we have to bring
the whole thing up. But how?
Get on the rig. I'll lower you down.
Get on!
Keep going!
Come on. Come on.
OK, hold it there.
Take it up!
- Get on!
- It's too heavy. Go!
Get on, dammit!
OK, go!
(winch rattles)
Keep going!
(Bond) That's it.
Swing it over to the truck.
Easy. Gently!
Right, lower it.
Take her up.
We've only seconds before this blows.
If it does, that powder keg goes with it.
The handbrake slipped.
Push! Push!
- Jump!
- I have to hold the brake off.
Jump!
Get Zorin for me!
May Day, jump!
Only seconds to go.
May Day, jump!
May Day!
James.
James!
Stacey, behind you! Get down!
James! (screams)
Come on, get in. Get up here!
The ship's nose is heavy.
He must be on the mooring rope.
Ohhh!
This'll hurt him more than me.
More! More power.
(creaking)
More. Do it!
(creaking)
(engine roars)
Full throttle!
(creaking)
Ohhh!
Right rudder. Do it!
Stop it!
Get her off. Get her off!
- Stop it! Are you crazy?
- Get her off. Get away!
Go get him.
Go!
Stacey, jump!
- Get a foothold!
- (screams)
Max! Max!
Aaaggghh!
James! James!
Stacey, give me your hand.
Get under the pipe.
OK, stay there.
James, look out!
Stacey, hold tight!
(panicked gabbling)
- Stacey, are you there?
- You betcha!
- Are you all right?
- (Stacey) Yes. Yes.
There's never a cab when you want one.
The Order of Lenin, for Comrade Bond.
The first time ever awarded
to a non-Soviet citizen.
I'd have expected the KGB to celebrate
if Silicon Valley had been destroyed.
On the contrary, Admiral.
Where would Russian
research be without it?
Is Commander Bond here?
I'd like to thank him personally.
(M) Sadly he's missing.
We are continuing our search,
but must presume the worst.
(amorous laughter)
(Bond) A bit of soap here...
and a little soap there!
- Oh, drat! I've dropped the soap.
- (Stacey) I'll get it. Whoo!
(Bond) That is not the soap.
(phone rings)
- Hello?
- (M) Grandfather calling Q.
- What's the position?
- 007 alive.
- Where is he? What's he doing?
- Just cleaning up a few details.
(Stacey) Oh, James...
- Mmm!
- (Bond chuckles)
Meeting you
With a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places
Feel the chill
Nightfall covers me
But you know the plans I'm making
Still oversee
Could it be the whole earth opening wide?
A sacred why
A mystery gaping inside
The weekends why
But can we dance into the fire?
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
When all we see
Is the view to a kill
Dance into the fire
When all we see
Is the view to a kill

We have a midcourse deviation.
Target heading 036, 126 miles.
Bearing 062, Havana, VOR.
He's landing at Cray Cay.
Advise Key West
Drug Enforcement.
Roger, sir. AWACS to Key West.
Key West Drug Enforcement,
please come in.
If they hurry, they just might
be able to grab the bastard.
Now, you're sure
you've got the ring?
Relax, Felix.
Friends of yours?
My partners at the DEA.
What the hell is going on?
Sanchez is in the Bahamas.
Have you cleared it
with Nassau?
We've got the green light.
Let's go! Hey, Felix, Felix!
Haven't you
forgotten something?
Oh, James, explain
to Della, will you?
No way. I'm coming with you.
Okay, but strictly
as an observer.
Sorry, Sharkey. Hey, why me?
Hey, you guys,
you can't do this to me!
What will I tell Della?
What did he promise you?
His heart?
Give her his heart.
No.
No, Franz.
I didn't mean any harm.
It's all right, baby.
We all make mistakes.
Your escapades are
getting more creative.
Not a word.
He's still not here.
Can you go around
the block again?
What about the guests?
I told you this was a mistake!
James, just in case.
Okay.
I want Sanchez alive!
Stay here, James.
No Sanchez. Damn.
Watch out!
Hey, observer!
You're trying to
get yourself killed?
If I don't get you back for the
wedding, I'm a dead man for sure!
You need help?
No. Take your hands off me.
Just go away.
Sanchez!
Let's go!
Come on! Come on!
He'll be in Cuban
airspace in 20 minutes.
He hasn't got away yet.
What the hell are you doing?
Let's go fishing!
Forward. Forward.
Easy. Hold it.
Back up. Back up.
Forward now.
Hold it!
Bring him in. Take the load.
No, please go home. I'm very...
There he is!
Let's go, James!
We made it!
Come along. James!
Your hat. Thank you.
I need, I need, I've got
to hold on to your love.
Ooooh.
Hey, baby, think you need a friend
to stand here by your side?
Yes, you do.
Your side.
Oh, baby, now you
can depend on me.
To do things right.
Things right.
Please don't bet
that you'll ever escape me.
Once I get my sights on you.
Got a license to kill.
And you know I'm going
straight for your heart.
Got a license to kill.
Anyone who
tries to tear us apart.
Ooh, honey.
License to kill.
Say that somebody
tries to make a move on you.
In the blink of an eye,
I will be there too.
And they'd better know
why I'm gonna make them pay.
Till their dying day
Till their dying day.
Till their dying day.
Got a license to kill.
And you know I'm going
straight for your heart, baby.
Got a license to kill.
Anyone who
tries to tear us apart.
License to kill.
Gotta hold onto your loving.
License to kill.
Kill.
On the double!
Get away from the door!
You're facing 139
felony counts, Sanchez.
Why, that's 936 years.
Even one of your famous million-dollar
bribes can't get you out of this one.
Two.
What?
$2 million, U.S.
A standing offer for
anyone who springs me.
God damn it!
You think you're in
some banana republic?
All that scumbag money won't
do you a bit of good here.
Very good.
But I think I'm gonna
be home soon, huh?
Why you...
Get a hold of yourself!
We got a nice private cell waiting
for your ass at Quantico,
and I'm going to personally
see you get there.
I'm terribly sorry!
That's a custom. You see, the bride
always gets to kiss her best man.
I thought it was
the other way around.
Oh, James, would you mind?
Felix is still in the study, and
we've got to cut this cake.
I'll do anything for
a woman with a knife.
Thank you. Yes, could
you help me here?
I'm sorry. No, no. Come in.
We're finished.
Pam, meet James.
Goodbye, Felix.
Strictly business, my friend.
Switch that thing off, Felix.
You know you have a house
full of guests waiting.
Just let me save this.
Take a seat.
The department wants
a full report, yesterday.
We really hit it lucky today.
Sanchez hasn't been out
of his home base for years.
Well, couldn't you
extradite him?
Not a chance.
He's killed,
intimidated or bribed
half the government officials
from here to Chile.
There's only one law down
there, Sanchez's law.
Lead or silver.
Ed.
Double congratulations,
old buddy.
You take your time on the
honeymoon. Everything's okay.
You must be Bond, the guy
who came along for the ride.
Ed Killifer.
We're taking Sanchez to
Quantico this afternoon.
Hey, stay and
have a drink with us.
Can't. Got to get back.
I just came by
to kiss the bride.
Felix, it's time
to cut the cake.
Hand me the picture of Della.
Quick.
She must be ready to kill me.
I tied them myself.
What are these? Lures!
These'll keep you busy
for the next few days.
I'm not going fishing
on my honeymoon!
How many others
are being held in there?
Where are you
taking him, Mr. Killifer?
Now, why did you
go to the Bahamas?
Mr. Sanchez, will you look this
way for a picture, please?
Come on, get him inside!
Get that lady out of there.
Are you really a Colombian?
Have you been fairly treated?
One more picture, please!
Are you connected with any
laboratories in South America?
Why did you go to the Bahamas?
No more questions.
Do you expect to be
vindicated, Mr. Sanchez?
Wait a minute!
Okay, let's go.
Yeah, we're moving out.
Will you excuse me, Liala?
Just a minute.
I have a surprise for you.
Oh, really.
Yes, I do.
It's right over here.
What's that?
James. Love always,
Della and Felix.
We love you.
Thanks.
Come on!
Did you get him?
Hang on.
I can't see him.
How deep is it there?
How many were inside?
Oh, James!
I wanted you to have something.
You know the tradition?
The next one who catches
this is the next one who...
No.
No. Thanks, Della.
It's time I left.
Oh, James.
Did I say something wrong?
He was married once,
but it was a long time ago.
Felix, you're no good to
me with a wrecked back.
Let her go.
I'm the one you want.
Hey! Ready to go?
We got the batteries
recharged on the sub.
It'll take you to
the 12-mile limit.
Fast boat to Cuba, you'll
be there for breakfast.
Relax. We'll wait for Dario.
Look, are you crazy?
You got everybody looking
for you.
What about Killifer?
Having a cop here is nuts!
I want to deep-six him.
I made a deal with this guy,
and I'm going to keep my word.
I don't like it.
He can finger me.
I spent a fortune
on this cover.
Something you'd
better understand, amigo,
loyalty is more important
to me than money.
Now, get the cop.
Killifer.
There's $2 million,
all in twenties.
It's very heavy,
but difficult to trace.
Smart.
Be ready for tomorrow.
I have someone to pick you up.
Where's Lupe? On the boat.
Keep her there
until I send for her.
Hey, no fooling
around with my girl.
You kidding?
After what you did to
that guy on the islands?
You liked my
little valentine, huh?
Where's my wife?
Don't worry. We gave
her a nice honeymoon.
I want you to know
this is nothing personal.
It's purely
business.
Killifer!
Sorry, old buddy, but two mil
is a hell of a chunk of dough.
Killing me won't stop
anything, Sanchez!
There are worse things
than dying, hombre.
See you in hell!
No.
Today's the first day
of the rest of your life.
No!
Thank you.
Good morning. Good morning.
Thank you.
Your passport, please?
What's going on?
Some big drug dealer
just escaped.
Now, will that be smoking
or non-smoking, Mr...
Your ticket!
Felix?
Della!
Della?
Felix.
You'll be all right. Hang on.
- Hey, Letter.
- Where you been?
It's Bond.
Get an ambulance here, quick!
Hi, Sharkey.
You stick around.
I might have some more
questions for you, okay?
How is he?
His left leg's
gone below the knee.
They might be
able to save his arm.
You can bet it was a chain saw.
Colombians love to
use them on informers.
Hell, they sell more here
than in the state of Oregon.
I wish I could be more hopeful,
but we'll have to wait and see.
Chain saw, my ass!
I know a shark bite
when I see one.
Sanchez has vanished.
He's got all of Letter's files.
God only knows what's in them.
Well, find him.
He's out of our jurisdiction.
I mean, there's plenty of
countries that will protect him.
We can't even
get an extradition.
There are other ways.
Let it go, Commander.
You're going to do nothing?
You're just going to
forget all about it?
No, I'm not gonna
forget about it!
Looks like Sanchez's law operates
north of the border, too.
Let's go shark hunting.
This is the last
place in the Keys.
We'll have to try Miami next.
Stay here.
You stay out of sight.
I'll handle this.
We're closed.
Ain't nobody here.
Look, I've come all the way
from London to see you.
Universal Exports.
We've been retained
by the Regent's Park Zoo
to arrange shipment of
a Carcharodon carcharias.
A what?
Great white shark.
It's all right, Bill.
Let him in.
Unfortunately, we sold all
our sharks years ago.
As you can see,
we do purely research now.
It's a project to
feed the third world.
We feed maggots
to our special breed
of genetically engineered fish,
use hormones to make them all
male, gain weight faster.
From your shark-hunting days?
Yeah. Actually, it's for sale.
Look, I'm kind of busy.
Maybe some other time.
Thank you. I look forward
to seeing you again.
Goodbye, Mr...
Goodbye.
Mr. Krest said to be ready.
He'll send the sub back in
three hours to pick you up.
Can't wait.
This dump gives me the creeps.
James.
Hold it, right there.
Do you mind if I get
my hands out of here?
Yeah. Do it slowly.
Freeze!
Over by the trapdoor,
old buddy.
Is this where you put
your old buddy Felix?
Not me.
Chalk that one up
to Sanchez and Krest.
Whoa!
There's $2 million
in that suitcase.
I'll split it with you.
You earned it.
You keep it, old buddy.
God, what a terrible waste.
Of money.
Hey, Sharkey!
Any news on the Wavekrest?
Yeah. She's a big marine research
vessel owned by a Milton Krest.
They're collecting specimens
off the Cay Sal Bank.
How long will it
take us to get there?
Maybe about six hours.
I have a few things to pick up.
Be ready in an hour.
Yeah, okay.
Hey, Commander,
you got a minute?
Local cops got a tip about
a warehouse last night.
Turned up 500 keys of Colombian
pure, a couple of stiffs,
and a little bitty piece
of what used to be Killifer.
Good. At least
someone's on the case.
You may be a pal of Letter's, but
I can only cover up so much.
The D.A. Is screaming
to know what happened.
You know, we got laws
in this country, too.
Do you have a law against
what they did to Letter?
Look, you're in over your head.
This is where it ends,
Commander.
You were supposed to
be in Istanbul last night.
I'm afraid this
unfortunate Letter business
has clouded your judgment.
You have a job to do.
I expect you on
a plane this afternoon.
I haven't finished here, sir.
Leave it to the Americans.
It's their mess.
Let them clear it up.
Sir, they're not
going to do anything.
Look, I owe it to Letter.
He's put his life on
the line for me many times.
Spare me this
sentimental rubbish.
He knew the risks.
And his wife?
This private vendetta of yours
could easily compromise.
Her Majesty's government.
You have an assignment, and I
expect you to carry it out
objectively and professionally.
Then you have
my resignation, sir.
We're not a country club, 007.
Effective immediately,
your license to
kill is revoked,
and I require you to
hand over your weapon.
Now.
I need hardly remind you that you're
still bound by the Official Secrets Act.
Well, then I guess it's
a farewell to arms.
Don't! Too many people.
God help you, Commander.
Something in sector C.
You caused us all a lot
of trouble, young lady.
You're borracho. Go to bed.
When Sanchez
heard you ran away,
he went nuts.
It's none of your business.
It's my business when
your stupid little tricks
get Sanchez arrested,
and I gotta put my organization
at risk to get him out.
The DEA just raided Key West.
You cost me a lot of dough.
He'll give you the money.
He doesn't work that way.
You better watch yourself,
girlie.
I've known him a long time.
I've seen a lot of girls
like you come and go.
You're drunk. Get out.
And stop peeking
through my windows.
Hey, come on, come on,
what are you so stuck-up for?
He fixed that phony
beauty contest you won.
Hey. Mr. Krest?
Yeah, what?
The Sentinel's picking up something
large on the monitor, sir.
I think you'd
better take a look.
I don't believe this.
What the hell is it now?
It's just a manta ray.
Get the probe back in.
We'll start loading now.
Yes, sir.
He said you're okay.
Take care of him.
Make a sound and you're dead.
You.
What are you doing in here?
Krest gave me his cabin.
He's next door.
Where's Sanchez?
He's not on board.
I don't know where he is.
You're his girlfriend.
He doesn't tell me anything.
Open it. I need to talk to you.
Answer it.
Just a moment.
What do you want?
Somebody slipped aboard.
Did you see anybody?
No, I was sleeping. Go away.
Mr. Krest. They're back.
Bolt your door.
Who whipped you? Sanchez?
It was my fault.
I did something wrong,
made him angry.
Nice work, Clive.
Thanks, Mr. Krest. Guess what?
His name was Sharkey.
- Get rid of the boat.
- We've got work to do.
You'd better find
yourself a new lover.
Don't you men
know any other way?
It's Sanchez's way.
You seem to like it.
You know nothing.
Please go.
If they find you here,
we'll both be killed.
Stay here.
We got everything
useful out of her.
That's it. Take her
out and sink her.
Okay, Clive. Cast off!
Compliments of Sharkey.
Man overboard!
Get him!
Don't let him get away!
What's wrong?
Get back in your
cabin and stay there.
The guy must have
drowned, Mr. Krest.
Don't be so sure. Find him!
Come on!
Launch Sentinel!
Yes, sir!
Stand by to
dive when I tell you.
Numbers one and two, dive!
I can see something
reflecting over there!
There's too much
turbulence to be sure.
Wavekrest! Wavekrest!
Loading completed, Mr. Krest.
Bring Sentinel back in.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Krest!
Bring Sentinel up!
There he is! There!
Right there! Get him!
There!
Dive, damn it! Dive!
Right there!
There! Pick him up!
All boats return to Wavekrest!
Aye, aye, sir.
Here. Put her stern-in.
Hey, do you know
someone called Bouvier?
Over there.
Well, this is an
unexpected pleasure.
Where's Letter?
Hospital, intensive care.
Where you'll be if you don't
get out of here fast.
Sanchez has Letter's files.
Your name's all over them.
Hell, I knew
something was wrong.
Those two have been
at the bar for hours.
Probably waiting to see
who showed up to meet me.
Would you like
anything to drink?
Bud with a lime. Yeah, same.
Sure thing, hon.
Shit! It's Dario. He's bad news.
He used to be with the Contras
before they kicked him out.
Just the kind of guy
Sanchez would send.
You carrying?
If they start shooting, you just
hit the deck and stay there.
La senorita Bouvier.
Don't I know
you from somewhere?
No. Oh, yes, I do.
You used to fly charter planes
for some friends of mine.
I got a job for you.
Why don't we go outside,
and we talk in private.
Take your hands off her.
She's with me.
Nobody's asking you, gringo.
He's with me.
Keep your hands on the table.
Here we go.
Two beers. That'll be $3.50.
Do your friends want something?
Let me get it!
He's had enough. Run a tab.
Okay.
How did you get here? By boat.
Where is it?
Back behind this wall.
Thanks.
Touche.
Get it started.
Come on!
Don't move.
Relax. It's a bulletproof vest.
This Kevlar's great.
You're bloody
lucky to be alive!
It's not luck. It's experience.
A few inches higher,
it'd have been your head.
Look, I just saved
your life back there.
If it wasn't for me,
your ass would've
been nailed to the wall.
You saved my life?
Yes.
It's a tough business
you've picked, Miss Bouvier.
Leave it to the professionals.
Look, pal, I was an army pilot.
I have flown to the toughest
hellholes in South America,
and I will not have you lecture
me about professionalism.
Out of gas.
I haven't heard
that one in a long time.
Well, they must
have hit the fuel line.
Look, I'm gonna need your help.
I want a complete rundown
on Sanchez's operation,
and I'll need a flight
to Isthmus City, private.
No one must know I've left.
What do you want
to go there for?
I'll pay you very well.
You're going after
Sanchez, aren't you?
Will you help me?
How many men have you got?
Just you and me.
Are you crazy?
Sanchez has an entire army
protecting him down there.
Just fly me in and leave.
$50,000.
It's not that easy.
False flight plans, payoffs
at Isthmus City Airport.
I can't do a job like
that for less than 100.
Sixty.
Ninety. Seventy.
Eighty. Seventy-five.
You pay the fuel?
You get the plane.
Deal.
Now, why don't you wait
until you're asked?
Well, why don't you ask me?
There are five typing errors
on the first page alone.
What's got into you?
Sorry, sir.
"U.S. Immigration
has no reports of 007"
"leaving the United States
as of 1500 hours today."
Who authorized this?
I did, sir.
I thought you'd be worried about James.
He's gone missing.
You know him better than that.
He'll go after Sanchez.
He's got to be stopped.
I've already alerted
our man in Isthmus.
I want that out
by this afternoon.
Yes, sir.
Q Branch, please.
This is the master bedroom.
I hope everything is
satisfactory, senor.
It's adequate.
I'd like a case of champagne,
Bollinger R. D.
Certainly, senor.
If I could ask you to sign
the registration cards?
No. My executive secretary, Miss
Kennedy, will take care of that.
Miss Kennedy...
Right here, please.
Fresh flowers every day.
Thank you very much.
Your key. Enjoy your stay.
It's Ms. Kennedy,
and why can't you be
my executive secretary?
We're south of the border.
It's a man's world.
Thanks for everything.
Your job's finished.
I want to stay. Too dangerous.
Enough people have
been killed already.
Don't talk to me about danger.
I won't be safe
until Sanchez is dead.
Besides, you could use my help.
Well, if you're going to stay
and be my executive secretary,
you'd better look the part.
Here. Buy yourself
some decent clothes.
What bank does Sanchez use?
I need to make a deposit.
The biggest one in town,
Banco de Isthmus.
He owns it.
Senor Bond.
I've come to
make a small deposit.
Well, I'm sure my people
downstairs are quite capable of...
Please sit down.
We operate the world's largest
private investment fund.
Our biggest problem is what
to do with all the money.
We have a cash surplus
of $10 million a day,
which we ship,
through our bank,
to the U.S. Federal Reserve,
thus establishing credits
which can be used for
any legitimate investment.
See, someone has to help the
gringos with their trade deficit.
Make out a deposit receipt for
$4,900,000 for senor Bond.
And of course there will be additional
monthly deposits in the same amount.
Of course. Be assured,
we at Banco de Isthmus
are experienced in handling
accounts of this nature.
Let me pass, please.
Senor Montelongo. Yes?
I'm Ms. Kennedy,
Mr. Bond's executive secretary.
I'd also appreciate it
if you could establish
a line of credit
for me at the casino.
Shall we say $2 million?
No problem.
You have excellent collateral,
and our chairman
also owns the casino.
Oh, a very convenient
arrangement.
We have always
thought so, senorita.
Thank you. Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen, and welcome.
This is a very
special night for us.
We want you to know that only through
your very generous donations
can the work here at the
OMI continue to progress.
We've learned so much, but we've
only just scratched the surface.
We need your help.
We need you to go to your phones
right now and make a pledge.
This is not for me.
This is not for them.
It's for all of us.
You okay, reinita?
I'm fine.
Krest called me from the boat
with a story about
somebody ripping him off.
Did you see anything happen
when you were there?
No, Franz. I stayed in my
cabin most of the time.
We need your help.
What's the matter, baby, huh?
You know
I can't stand that thing.
I'd like a private table.
Blacklack.
Certainly, senor Bond.
Would you come
this way, please?
Quarter of a million dollars,
and I'd like to raise
the limit to $5,000 a box.
Put these wonderful
volunteers behind me to work.
Dario will take you
shopping tomorrow.
You can spend a lot
of money, have fun.
Now, give me a little kiss.
Want one, too?
We can raise the price.
$22,000 per kilo this month.
I like that.
Yeah, this is Truman-Lodge.
$22,000.
Our goal today is to raise...
$22,000 from each of
our meditation chapters.
That's $22,000 each.
Go to your phones.
Please help us.
Bless your hearts.
Let me have half a million.
Listen to this. Our
wonderful Manhattan chapel
has just made
a special $500 pledge.
Five hundred kilos.
I knew they'd go for it.
This guy cracks me up.
Is senor Sanchez there?
Yes, he's right here.
Yeah? I got a British sucker
who dropped
a quarter of a million,
and he wants to play no-limit.
Which one?
Table two.
Plays like a real jerk-off.
That's the guy that flew in
in the private plane today,
opened that
account at the bank.
$5 million in cash.
Let him play.
Double down.
Split.
Listen to this.
Our Chicago chapel has just
received a $1,000 double pledge.
They all
accepted the new price.
- Senor Sanchez.
- Yes, he's right here.
Bless your hearts.
The British guy is a
quarter-million ahead.
Shall I close the table?
No.
Send whatever you can send.
Tell Lupe to come in here.
Right.
You have good luck tonight.
You gonna share
any of that money?
Miss Kennedy, would you get me
a medium-dry vodka martini?
Well, why don't you ask...
Shaken, not stirred.
Cut?
You're very professional.
Used to work here.
Am I going to win or lose?
Lose, but not much.
Vodka martini, que?
Shaken, not stirred.
Looks like your
luck has changed.
Is that why he sent you?
And to find out more about you.
Perhaps I'd better
quit for the night.
You should walk
straight out of here,
go to the airport
and never come back.
Where's Sanchez?
Upstairs in his office.
He's been there all day.
He's planning a big party for
some Orientals tomorrow night.
And what did you tell him
about the Wavekrest?
Nothing. Now go.
Take me to him.
You loco?
You'll get us both killed.
This way, please.
- Send us a dollar.
- Send us 50 cents.
Send whatever you can send.
We've got a very special
offer for you guys out there
with your beer
and your popcorn...
This is almost over.
This particular book has sold in excess
of a quarter of a million copies.
Anyone who sends in a
$100 pledge or more
will receive a personally
autographed copy of my book,
The Secrets of
Cone Power Revealed.
Lovely view.
It's a $49.95 value, and
you get it absolutely free.
Bond, James Bond.
Sit, please.
We need your help.
Bless your hearts.
Well-traveled man.
You did all right
at the tables tonight.
I had the feeling my luck
was about to change.
Well, it's a wise gambler who
knows when his luck has run out.
Why this?
In my business, you prepare
for the unexpected.
And what business is that?
I help people with problems.
Problem solver?
More of a problem eliminator.
And now you're
here on business?
No. Temporarily unemployed.
I thought I
might find work here.
Well, it's very difficult to
obtain a work permit in Isthmus.
It's...
Well, one has to show a special
talent that people here don't have.
Well, that shouldn't
be too difficult.
Senor Bond,
you got big cojones.
You come here to my place, without
references, carrying a piece,
throwing around a lot of money.
But you should
know something...
Nobody saw you come in, so
nobody has to see you go out.
Senor Sanchez, I could be very
useful to a man in your position.
And I understand
you have a reputation
for rewarding
loyalty very well.
I'll keep this for a few days.
We'll talk again.
And you won't need
a gun in Isthmus.
It's a very safe city.
In the meantime, I welcome you
to the casino at all times.
Check him out.
So what did you find out?
He's sitting up there behind
two inches of armored glass.
I'd need a cannon
to get to him.
Senor Bond, you'll be pleased
to know your uncle has arrived.
I put him in your suite.
Thank you. Good night, senor.
Your uncle?
Let's make this
a proper family reunion.
Give me a gun.
Stay here.
Really, 007.
Q! What the hell are you doing here?
I might have killed you!
Well, I'm on leave.
Thought I'd pop around and
see how you're getting on.
You all right?
Yes, of course I'm all right.
How'd you find me?
Well, Moneypenny, of course.
She's worried sick about you!
This is no place for you, Q.
Go home.
Don't be an idiot, 007.
I know exactly
what you're up to.
And quite frankly,
you're gonna need my help.
Remember, if it hadn't
been for Q Branch,
you'd have been dead long ago.
Everything for
a man on holiday.
Explosive alarm clock.
Guaranteed never to wake
up anybody who uses it.
Dentonite toothpaste,
to be used sparingly.
It's the latest
in plastic explosive.
I could do with some plastic.
I thought there might
be a mess to clean up.
Pam, this is Q, my uncle.
Uncle, this is Miss Kennedy,
my cousin.
We must be related.
How do you do?
Now, pay attention, 007.
Now, this looks like an
ordinary camera, doesn't it?
What kind of film
does it take, 120?
No, .220, high-velocity.
Now, this is a signature gun, and
that is an optical palm reader.
And if I plug this into the bottom
like that, once I've programmed it...
Now, nobody can
use the gun but you.
Smile, boys.
Don't use the flash!
Stop fiddling about with
things you don't understand!
You might easily
have killed him.
That's odd.
Look, let's all get
some rest, shall we?
We've got a long, hard day
ahead of us tomorrow.
Good night, Q.
Sweet dreams, Mr. Bond.
I hope you don't snore, Q.
You all know Truman-Lodge,
and this is my head of
security, Colonel Heller.
This is an historic moment.
East meets West.
Drug dealers of
the world, unite.
Extra bonus. Your job's done.
Take Q and fly out of here now.
I'll make my own way back.
I'd like to stay.
No. I work better alone.
In this business,
there's a lot of cash,
and with a lot of people
with their hands out.
In a word, bribery.
Exactly.
He took the words
right out of my pocket.
So you pay.
Everyone and his brother
is on the payroll.
So you buy a mayor, a chief
of police, a general,
Presidents.
One day you wake up, you own
the whole goddamn country.
Then you take what you want.
Bank, a gambling casino,
airline concession.
Why?
Simple. It's easier for the
politicians to take silver than lead.
We have an invisible empire
from Chile to Alaska.
What I want to do, amigos,
is to make you part of it.
I want the Pacific
to be our little puddle.
What you have before you,
gentlemen, is a demographic report,
breaking down each
of your territories
by age and socioeconomic group.
Now, as you can clearly see, there
is a huge potential demand,
given the implementation
of aggressive marketing.
As in the United States,
Senor Sanchez is prepared to offer
each of you exclusive franchises.
The price is $100
million per territory.
I believe you'll find that works out to
$20 million per metric ton, Mr. Tan.
We guarantee quality
and price for five years.
Senor Sanchez,
since arriving,
we've eaten well,
heard many good stories,
but before I pay anything,
I want to see some hardware.
Mr. Kwang,
you don't pay for hardware.
You pay for my personal
guarantee and protection.
Surely, if you were
to invest $100 million,
you would want
some reassurance.
You know, you're right.
Why not?
Tomorrow, I'll take you to our
main distribution center.
Here you are.
Goodbye, Q.
Thanks for all you've done.
What?
You're a hell of
a field operative.
Now, go. I'll see
you back in London.
No more business.
Gentlemen, enjoy yourselves.
Hi, there!
Hi! How are you?
This Kwang,
he seems like trouble.
Why show them the labs?
Don't worry.
He won't expose the operation.
His Excellency,
el Presidente Lopez.
Hector.
There's been
a mistake with my check.
Look at it.
It's half the usual amount.
You were very quiet
when I was arrested.
Remember, you're
only President for life.
Watch the birdie, you bastard.
Take his arm.
Who'd have a signature gun?
James Bond.
This is the property of
Her Majesty's government.
How did you get it?
Piss off.
Who ordered you
to kill Sanchez?
No one. He's a rogue agent.
I've got orders to take him
back, one way or the other.
We're Hong Kong Narcotics,
you bastard!
Sanchez is taking us to the
heart of his operations.
I've been setting it
up for years!
I just hope that little stunt
of yours hasn't scared him off.
Get me out of
these bloody things.
No, Commander. You're a
loose cannon on deck.
I'm shipping you
straight back to London.
Leave him! No!
Come on!
Don't let them take you alive.
He's still alive.
Who was it? Who sent you?
Cyanide.
Hey, amigo!
How do you feel?
I'll survive.
Lupe, please.
The Wavekrest is arriving tonight.
Krest is coming here.
No, no, no, I'll call you back.
Pedro, bring us some
coffee, por favor.
Good.
Baby, please?
Well, we both had
close calls last night.
You were just in time.
Things were
about to turn nasty.
Who were those guys?
Freelance hit team.
What did they want with you?
One of them must have
recognized me in the casino.
They were afraid I'd warn
you, spoil their plans.
So you knew them?
I used to work for
the British government.
We kept dossiers on such people.
British agent.
I knew it.
You have class.
Those men tried to kill me.
Who would do such a thing?
Someone close to you.
Cream? Sugar?
No.
Did they tell you this?
They were well-briefed, obviously
by someone on the inside.
Did they mention a name?
No.
Only that they were expecting
to be paid a great deal of cash
by someone arriving
in Isthmus tonight.
You suspect someone?
Everyone in my
organization is 100% loyal.
Then you have
nothing to worry about.
Yeah, well, I have
to go meet some people.
Why don't you rest here?
No. I have to go
back to my hotel.
No. Don't go to the hotel.
Save your money. I insist.
Stay here.
Enjoy my hospitality.
Lupe, show him the
easy way up, please.
You are not gonna believe
who this guy is.
Former British agent.
How did you know that?
Because I know things.
I want to meet
Krest's boat tonight.
We'll need
a dozen reliable men.
Is there a problem with Krest?
We'll see. And bring Lupe.
She was there.
He's not gonna
lie in front of her.
What are you doing?
I've had my fill of
Sanchez's hospitality.
He told you to stay. You're
asking for big trouble.
Look, there's no need
for you to get involved.
Just give me five minutes,
then scream your head off.
James, please, listen to me.
There's guards
all over the place.
You'll never make it.
I'm going shopping.
I won't be long.
Please don't. Not now.
Senor Sanchez said.
I haven't had one of
these in five years.
Don't worry.
007 always comes back.
James, hi.
I thought I told
you to leave, Q.
We couldn't go without knowing
what had happened to you.
Get your bags packed, Q.
What the hell is
the matter with you?
Just a couple of things.
Kwang and his team of
British agents are dead.
Sanchez is alive.
I saw you in Heller's office.
You're working with them. No.
I want the truth.
I am telling the truth.
Sanchez has arranged to buy four
Stinger missiles from the Contras,
and he's threatened to shoot
down an American airliner
if the DEA doesn't lay off.
What's that got to
do with you and Heller?
Felix gave me a letter at his
wedding from the Attorney General
granting Heller immunity
if he gets the Stingers back.
Did he go for the deal?
Yes.
And then you missed Sanchez,
and Heller panicked and
he said the deal was off,
and that I was dead
if he ever saw me again.
There's more to this than
your personal vendetta.
It's a mess.
Sanchez has
tripled his security.
You'll never get
another shot at him.
We don't have to.
Meet me at the harbor
master's office in two hours.
Q, bring the Rolls round
to the front of the hotel.
Yes, sir.
Senor Bond.
Senor Montelongo,
I'm making a withdrawal.
Pilot coming aboard, sir.
Well? Take me to the bridge.
Gracias, Captain.
I'll take over now.
You? You're the harbor pilot?
No, I'm his secretary!
All yours, sir... Ma'am.
Do you think you're
going in a bit too fast?
You wanna do the driving?
You take the wheel.
Full speed astern.
What the hell are you doing?
Check the forward component!
Harbor pilot went crazy.
I'd stick to flying
if I were you.
I got the job done.
Franz, what a surprise!
I didn't think you'd be here.
Yeah. I like surprises.
You seem to be having
a lot of problems lately.
Well, we had this
crazy harbor pilot.
Let's talk about
the money you owe me.
Why don't we talk inside.
Does he have a safe?
Not up here. Maybe below.
Have a look around.
Do I have this right?
He water-skied behind the
plane, jumps on it...
No, no. He was...
Well, yeah.
He threw the pilots out
and flew away.
Like a little bird.
The knife.
Pedro.
Would I make up a story like that?
You must have seen something.
Where's 007? He's coming.
That's not my money. I swear.
That's right, amigo. It's mine.
You think I'm stupid, huh?
You rip me off, then use my own
money to pay someone to kill me?
You want it so bad?
Then take it!
What are you doing?
Wait. Let me talk.
It's not my money!
No! What the...
That hurts. Please!
What are you doing?
Sanchez.
Please, Franz. No!
What about the money, patron?
Launder it.
This is where you leave.
Take the plane. I'll
see you both in Miami.
Aren't you coming?
No. They'll be after me.
It'll be safer on my own.
Come on, my dear.
See you later.
What's that?
Bond's clothes. They're clean.
Sorry to wake you, hermano.
I thought you'd like to know the
information you gave me paid off.
I got the guy who set me up.
Only one guy?
What do you mean?
I just thought that
no one would be stupid enough to
try to take you on on their own.
Listen, I want you to
come with me tomorrow.
Where are we going?
It's a surprise.
You're gonna like it.
James, what are you
doing back here?
I don't think your being
here's a good idea, Lupe.
It's all right. Franz is having
dinner with the Chinese.
Do you know where
he's taking me tomorrow?
He's showing them
a special place.
I don't know where.
James, don't go. I'm scared.
What's gonna happen to us?
Don't worry.
When this is all over, I'll
make sure you get back home.
Home? It took me 15 years
to get away from there.
I don't wanna go back.
Can't we leave together?
I'll be safe with you.
No, Lupe. I don't think
that would work out.
How can we tell unless we try?
I think it's gonna
work out very well.
All right. I'll answer it.
Miss Kennedy, I saw you
at the casino with James.
We need to speak in private.
It's all right. He's with me.
James is in danger.
Sanchez is no fool.
He's checking up on him. You know,
if they find anything suspicious...
Listen, it's all right. He's
safely out of the country by now.
You don't understand.
Last night, he stayed with me.
At Sanchez's house?
Si. Franz is
taking him on a trip.
They leave in an hour.
You must help him.
If anything happens to him,
I don't know what I'll do.
You know, I love James so much.
Look, you must go
before you're missed.
Now, don't worry.
We'll think of something.
"I love James so much." I'll
be damned if I'll help him.
Look, don't judge him
too harshly, my dear.
Field operatives must often use
every means at their disposal
to achieve their objectives.
Bullshit.
Bond's just left in convoy.
Two cars and a Jeep,
turning north
onto the main highway.
I copy that, Q. Over and out.
What are you doing to my plane?
Overhaul.
Senor Sanchez order it.
I must have a plane.
Where can I rent one?
No planes.
You brought the
Stingers, manito.
From now on, I want
them close to me.
We started this place
strictly as a cover,
but Professor Joe manages
to turn a tidy profit.
Welcome. This way, please.
I'm going to have to ask that
each of you put on one of these.
It's for your own safety,
so I'm sure you'll understand.
We can't have our best customers
developing a drug habit.
This way, gentlemen.
Our product dissolves completely
in ordinary gasoline,
making it
absolutely undetectable.
How do you get it back?
Hey, you want us to tell you all
our secrets before we're partners?
Take them to the lab.
This way, gentlemen.
Who's the new guy?
Somebody I thought
could be useful.
Can I help you?
I have a special
surprise for Professor Joe.
Sorry. No visitors this week.
I came all the way
from Wichita Falls.
I'm sorry. The folks back
home took up a collection.
They'd be so disappointed if Professor
Joe didn't accept it personally.
You may remove your
masks now, gentlemen.
So, do we have a deal?
The terms, gentlemen,
were $100 million in negotiable
bearer bonds from each of you.
Welcome.
Professor Joe. It's really you!
It's magnificent.
Rebuilt stone for stone and restored
to all of its original glory.
Is this for me?
Yes, I almost forgot.
I got so flustered...
Tell me, child, have you ever
thought of studying here?
Would that be possible?
Come along. Let's see if
you have the aptitude.
To a long association.
What's the process?
It's very simple.
An 18% mixture of cocaine
and ordinary gasoline.
Just keep quiet.
We already have your first shipment being
loaded into the four tanker trucks.
Welcome, my dear.
Please join me.
Wow.
This is my humble sanctuary away
from the cares of the world.
Your own private
meditation chamber.
Built from the sacred rocks
of the original temple.
I did have it soundproofed, so
nothing will disturb our meditation.
I brought you another surprise.
I love surprises. Where is it?
Look, this really
isn't necessary.
Give me the keys.
Bless your heart.
Your monthly delivery will
be by ocean-going tanker.
We'll send our chief chemist along to
supervise the reconversion process.
You'll keep the gas as a bonus.
And if there's a problem
with customs, no evidence.
Come on, hurry!
I know him. He's an informer.
You disappoint me.
Who are you working for, huh?
Tell me.
You don't wanna talk?
I can get the trucks out, but I
don't think I can control the fire.
Forget the fire. Get some cars.
We're gonna take
the tankers with us.
Wait a minute. This setup
cost us $32 million.
We have to try and save it.
I don't give a shit
about the setup.
We've got $500 million
in the case and
20 tons of Colombian
pure in the tankers.
Now go help Heller.
But we have a deal with the Orientals.
We've got their money.
I said go help Heller.
Now, do you wanna
make this hard or easy?
Put him in the conveyor.
When you're up to your ankles,
you're gonna beg to
tell me everything.
When you're up to your knees,
you'll kiss my ass to kill you.
I'm the least of
your problems, Sanchez.
If you couldn't trust Krest,
who can you trust?
Who's got your $500 million?
Truman-Lodge?
What about the Stingers?
What do you know
about Stingers?
We gotta go, patron. This
place'll blow up any second.
Where's Heller?
I don't know.
That's the last you'll see
of Heller and your Stingers.
Thanks for the advice.
Have my car meet me up at the top.
Braun, come with me.
You're dead.
You took the words
right out of my mouth.
Sanchez!
Are you all right?
Switch the bloody machine off.
Hey. I was making
sure these were secure.
It's a good idea.
Take them up to my car.
Of course.
Oh, God. It's Heller.
Yeah. Looks like he
came to a dead end.
Come on.
Come on! Come on! Follow me!
You. Come with me.
Come on.
Surprise!
Bless your heart!
Perez.
Bond has escaped.
Meet me at Paso del Diablo.
- Don't worry.
- It's only money.
Okay, que pase.
Oh, no.
Shit!
Brilliant.
Well done, Franz.
Another $80 million write-off.
I guess it's time to
start cutting overhead.
Dame el Stinger!
James!
You could have had everything.
Don't you want to know why?
What are you waiting for?
Get in.
Yes, sir.
I'll be up to see you next week.
We'll do some fishing.
Good. I'll be out
by then. M called.
He tried to reach you. I think
he may have a job for you.
Look, Felix, I have to go.
My hostess has just arrived.
Take care, James.
You, too. Goodbye.
I thought you hated that thing.
Don't you know, iguanas
are a girl's best friend.
Well, here's to you, my dear.
Cheers.
Thank you for
everything, James.
Thank you.
You could stay here with me.
Excuse me.
I think you and el Presidente
will make a perfect couple.
Why don't you wait
until you're asked?
So, why don't you ask me?
Used to be that
I believed in something.
Used to be that
I believed in love.
It's been a long time
since I've had that feeling
I could love someone
I could trust someone
I said I'd never let nobody
near my heart again, darling
I said I'd never let nobody in.
If you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever.
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart And
stay here in your arms forever.
If you asked me to.
Somehow ever since
I've been around you.
Can't go back
to being on my own.
Can't help feeling, darling
Since I've found you.
That I've found my home
That I'm finally home
I said I'd never let nobody
get too close to me, darling
I said I needed
Needed to be free.
If you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever.
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart And
stay here in your arms forever.
If you.
Ask me to and I
will give my world.
To you, baby I need you now.
Ask me to and I'll do anything.
Anything.
For you baby For you baby.
If you asked me to
I beg your pardon.
I forgot to knock.
I'm alone.
Aren't we all?
- You're late, 007.
- I had to stop in the bathroom.
Ready to save the world again?
After you, 006.
James, for England.
For England, Alec.
It's too easy.
Half of everything is luck, James.
And the other half?
Fate.
- Set timers: six minutes.
- Six minutes, check.
Fire!
Closing time, James!
Last call!
Buy me a pint.
This is Colonel Ourumov! Come out
with your hands above your heads!
How original.
Shut the door, Alec!
There's a draft!
Alec?
Move out. Throw down your weapon
and walk towards me, slowly.
Finish the job, James!
Blow them all to hell!
You have ten seconds.
Ten...
nine... eight...
seven... six...
five...
four... three... two...
For England, James!
Hold your fire!
You'll blow the gas tanks!
This is your last chance.
Come out with your hands above your...
Wait!
You can't win.
Get out there! Move!
Move it!
Hold your fire!
Wait!
James, is it really necessary
to drive quite so fast?
More often than you'd think.
I enjoy a spirited ride
as much as the next girl, but...
- Who's that?
- The next girl.
James, stop this! Stop it!
I know what you're doing.
Really?
What's that, dear?
You are just trying to show off
the size of your, your...
- Engine?
- Ego.
We're having a pleasant drive, and
you've got to bring psychology into it.
I was just sent here
to evaluate you.
Let's try and put that
behind us, shall we?
Ladies first.
- James, I want you to stop this car.
- Really?
Stop this car at once!
As you can see, I have no problem
with female authority.
James, you're incorrigible.
What am I going to do with you?
Well, let's toast your evaluation,
shall we?
A very thorough evaluation.
Madame wins.
Bet, Mademoiselle? No?
Monsieur?
Bets, ladies and gentlemen?
No players?
It appears we share the same passions.
Three, anyway.
I count two.
Motoring and baccarat.
Seven. Madame wins.
I hope the third
is where your real talent lies.
One rises to meet a challenge.
Madame stands with five.
Six. Madame loses.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
The very words I live by.
And what words do you live by?
The trick is to quit
while you're still ahead.
That's one trick I've never learned.
Perhaps you'll show me how it's done.
Vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.
And for you?
The same.
How do you take it?
Straight up, with a twist.
Thank you, Mr... .?
The name's Bond.
James Bond.
Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp.
- Onatopp?
- Onatopp.
Your accent, Georgian?
Very good, Mr. Bond.
- You've been to Russia?
- Not recently.
I used to drop in occasionally.
Shoot in and out.
It's very different now,
a land of opportunity.
With a new Ferrari in every garage?
No, not quite.
That belongs to a friend.
A tip for your friend:
The French registration plates for this
year's model start with the letter 'L. '
Even the counterfeit ones.
Oh. And what rank
do you hold...
with the Motor Vehicles Department,
Mr. Bond?
Commander.
- Shall we go?
- This one is an Admiral.
I like a woman
who enjoys pulling rank.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Bond.
The pleasure, I'm sure,
was all mine.
Transmission begins from Moneypenny.
Identification confirmed:
Onatopp, Xenia. Ex-Soviet fighter pilot.
Current suspected links to the
Janus crime syndicate, St. Petersburg.
Yacht Manticore is leased to
a known Janus corporate front.
M authorizes you
to observe Miss Onatopp...
but stipulates no contact
without prior approval.
End transmission. Moneypenny.
Good night, James.
I trust you'll stay
'on-a-topp' of things.
Xenia, I can't breathe!
Yes! Yes!
My respects, Admiral.
Delighted to have you aboard,
Mademoiselle.
Ladies and gentlemen...
please take your seats on the upper deck
for the demonstration of the aircraft.
What you are about
to see in operation...
is Europe's answer
to the electronic battlefield:
the first working prototype
of the Tiger helicopter.
Uniquely maneuverable, the Tiger
not only uses stealth technology...
it is the only helicopter
to be hardened against...
all forms of
electronic interference...
radio jamming
and electromagnetic radiation.
I have a small surprise from
your friends back at the barracks.
I think I've gone to heaven.
Not yet.
Now please welcome the pilots.
Lieutenant Commander
Bernard Jaubert...
and Lieutenant Francois Brouse.
Select Mir.
Autographic projection.
Compute possible intercept
with second stage geo-sat two.
Anna.
He wouldn't know a woman
if one came up and sat on his head.
Boris.
- Boris!
- What?
I thought I'd post it
on the Internet, no?
- What's the password?
- I made it easy this time.
Even you should be able to break it,
borscht for brains.
All right, all right,
I'll give you a hint.
They're right in front of you
and can open very large doors.
You're such a geek.
Yes, I'm in!
You've hacked into
the U.S. Department of Justice.
Do you know what will happen
if they trace it here?
The Chief of Computers
will call me a genius...
move me to Moscow and give me
a million bucks hard currency.
I think not.
Besides, the Americans are slug-heads.
They'll never detect me.
- You were saying, slug-head?
- Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko!
Spiked them!
Come on, Boris, just hang up.
No way! I spiked them!
All right, what's the password?
I'm not going to tell you.
Okay, let me guess.
It's not in front of me?
You sit on it,
but you can't take it with you.
My program seizes the phone line
of whoever's tracing me...
and jams their modem
so they can't hang up.
Now the hunted
becomes the hunter.
Better luck next time...
slug-heads!
Bang! Gone!
I am invincible!
Was it good for you, too?
I'm getting some coffee.
I'm going for a cigarette.
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov...
head of Space Division.
- General, if I'd known...
- You'd have been ready.
This is an unscheduled test of the
Severnaya facility. War simulation.
We are going to test-fire GoldenEye.
Report your status.
Two operational satellites, sir:
Petya and Mischa...
both in 90-minute earth orbit
at 100 kilometers.
Good. Here is the
authorization code.
Now, the GoldenEye and today's access
numbers for satellite Petya, please.
I am timing you.
Good.
Thank you, Major.
On my count.
Three... two... one.
Set target: Severnaya.
Arm the weapon.
Check it!
Their best response time is 19 minutes.
They'll be late.
It's clean.
I had to ventilate someone.
- Good evening, Moneypenny.
- Good evening, James.
M will meet you in the situation room.
I'm to take you straight in.
I've never seen you after hours,
Moneypenny. Lovely.
- Thank you, James.
- Out on a professional assignment?
Dressing to kill?
I know you'll
find this crushing, 007...
but I don't sit at home every night
praying for an international incident...
so I can run down here all dressed up
to impress James Bond.
I was on a date with a gentleman.
We went to the theater together.
Moneypenny, I'm devastated.
What would I ever do without you?
As far as I can remember, James,
you've never had me.
Hope springs eternal.
You know, this sort of behavior
could qualify as sexual harassment.
Really?
What's the penalty for that?
Someday you have to make good
on your innuendos.
- After you, Moneypenny.
- No, I insist.
You first.
- Good evening, 007.
- Tanner. What's up?
Sixteen minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress call...
Sixteen minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress call...
from a supposedly abandoned
radar station at Severnaya.
Look what the satellite picked up.
We found a match:
your missing Tiger.
In the middle of Northern Russia.
It seems your hunch
was right, 007.
It's too bad the evil Queen of Numbers
wouldn't let you play it.
- You were saying?
- No, I was just...
Good. Because if I want sarcasm,
Mr. Tanner, I'll talk to my children.
- Good evening, 007.
- Good evening, M.
The Prime Minister's
waiting for an update.
Proceed with your briefing,
Mr. Tanner.
Thank you.
After the distress signal,
your helicopter took off...
and the Russians scrambled
these three MIGs here to intercept it.
What do you think the Russians
are using the base for?
Well, at one point we suspected
Severnaya might be the ground station...
for a secret space-based weapons program
called GoldenEye, but...
Our statistical analysis
saw they had...
neither the finance
nor technology to implement it.
Numbers were never
my strong suit.
Are these pictures live?
Unlike the American government, we
prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.
Negative so far.
Everything seems normal.
What the bloody hell was that?
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova!
Boris!
Boris!
Thanks.
Our satellite is knocked out.
So are two of the Americans.
We have another
coming into range...
now.
Good God.
Two of the MIGs are down.
And it looks like
the third went into the dish.
What do you think?
No lights.
Not one single electric light on
in a 30-mile radius.
E.M.P.?
- That explains the MIGs and satellites.
- And the blackout.
Electromagnetic Pulse:
a first-strike satellite weapon
developed by the...
The Americans and Soviets
during the Cold War.
I've read the brief.
Discovered after Hiroshima.
Set off a nuclear device
in the upper atmosphere.
Creates a pulse...
a radiation surge that destroys
everything with an electronic circuit.
The idea being to knock out
the enemy's communications...
before he, she, or they
could retaliate.
So, GoldenEye exists.
Yes.
- Could this be an accident?
- No.
The helicopter.
If you wanted to steal the GoldenEye,
it was the perfect getaway vehicle.
Setting off the blast was the ideal way
to wipe out any trace of the crime.
The Janus group?
It may have been involved
with the helicopter.
I know the Russian
failsafe systems.
You don't just walk in
and ask for the keys to the bomb.
You need the access codes.
It had to be an insider.
And at least one person
probably knows who it is.
Very well, sir.
Thank you. Good night.
The Prime Minister's
talked to Moscow.
They're saying it was an accident
during a routine training exercise.
Governments change.
The lies stay the same.
What else do we know about
the Janus syndicate?
Topflight arms dealers,
headquartered in St. Petersburg.
The first outfit to restock
the Iraqis during the Gulf War.
The head man's unreliably described.
No photographs.
The woman, Onatopp...
is our only confirmed contact.
- Would you care for a drink?
- Thank you.
- Your predecessor kept cognac in the...
- I prefer bourbon.
- Ice?
- Yes.
We've pulled the files on
anyone who might have had access...
or authority at Severnaya.
The top name on the list is
an old friend of yours, I understand.
Ourumov.
They made him a General.
He sees himself as
the next Iron Man of Russia.
So our political analysts rule him out.
He doesn't fit the profile of a traitor.
Are these the same analysts
who said that GoldenEye couldn't exist?
Who said the helicopter
posed no immediate threat...
and wasn't worth following?
You don't like me, Bond.
You don't like my methods.
You think I'm an accountant...
a 'bean counter, ' more interested
in my numbers than your instincts.
- The thought had occurred to me.
- Good.
Because I think you're a sexist,
misogynist dinosaur.
A relic of the Cold War...
whose boyish charms,
though wasted on me, obviously appeal...
to that young woman
I sent out to evaluate you.
- Point taken.
- Not quite, 007.
If you think for one moment I don't have
the balls to send a man out to die...
your instincts are dead wrong.
I've no compunction about
sending you to your death.
But I won't do it on a whim, even with
your cavalier attitude towards life.
I want you to find GoldenEye.
Find who took it, what they plan
to do with it, and stop it.
And if you should come across Ourumov,
guilty or not...
I don't want you running off
on some kind of vendetta.
Avenging Alec Trevelyan
will not bring him back.
- You didn't get him killed.
- Neither did you.
Don't make it personal.
Never.
Bond.
Come back alive.
Good morning, General Ourumov.
Defense Minister Mishkin,
gentlemen.
Please deliver your report.
As this Council is aware,
a secret weapon system code-named
GoldenEye was detonated over Severnaya.
As head of Space Division...
I personally undertook
the investigation.
I have concluded this crime
was committed by Siberian separatists...
seeking to create
political unrest.
Regrettably,
the peaceful work...
and much-needed hard currency
earnings of Severnaya...
have been set back
by several years.
Therefore,
I tender my resignation.
It seems the Council does not
want your head, Arkady Grigorovich.
Merely your Ioyal assurance that
there are no other GoldenEye satellites.
I can give you that assurance,
Defense Minister.
And what of the two missing
Severnaya technicians?
I was aware only of the one,
Boris Grishenko.
There was a girl also
whose body was not among the dead.
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova,
a level-two programmer.
I will investigate immediately,
Defense Minister.
It would seem presumptuous,
General...
to blame this incident
on Siberian separatists...
before the whereabouts
of your own people are determined.
Do you agree?
Yes, Defense Minister.
Thank you for
bringing it to my attention.
That will be all.
Morning, Q.
Sorry about the leg. Skiing?
Hunting!
Right. Now pay attention, 007.
First, your new car, BMW.
Agile, five forward gears,
all-points radar...
self-destruct system...
and naturally,
all the usual refinements.
Now, this I'm
particularly proud of.
Behind the headlights,
Stinger missiles.
Excellent. Just the thing for unwinding
after a rough day at the office.
Need I remind you, 007...
that you have a licence to kill...
not to break the traffic laws.
- I wouldn't think of it.
- Good.
Right. Let's get on
to more practical matters.
A typical leather belt.
Male, size 34, buckle notch.
- Have you finished?
- Yes.
Good. A typical leather belt.
Q, I'm familiar with that device.
Not one with a 75-foot rappelling cord
built into the buckle.
Fire, and out shoots a piton...
followed by a high-tensile wire
designed to support your weight.
I see. And what if I need
additional support?
It's tested for one, 007.
Flight 878 to St. Petersburg.
X-ray document scanner.
A pen.
This is a Class Four grenade.
Three clicks
arms the four-second fuse.
Another three disarms it.
How long did you say the fuse was?
Oh, grow up, 007!
They always said the pen
was mightier than the sword.
Thanks to me, they were right.
Look, let's ask Freddie here
to demonstrate for us.
Here we are.
Sorry about this, Fred.
One... two... three.
Don't say it.
The writing's on the wall?
Along with the rest of him.
Now, 007, do please try
and return some of...
Do please try and return some of
this equipment in pristine order.
Don't touch that!
It's my lunch.
In London,
April's a spring month.
Oh, yeah?
And what are you, the weatherman?
For crying out loud,
another stiff-assed Brit...
with your secret codes
and your passwords.
One of these days you guys
are going to learn just to drop it.
Come on, my car's over there.
- After you.
- Thank you.
Like you said, drop it.
In London,
April's a spring month...
whereas in St. Petersburg
we're freezing our butts off!
Now, is that close enough
for government work?
No. Show me the rose.
Please, no.
All right, all right, all right!
- Muffy?
- Third wife.
- Jack Wade, CIA.
- James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.
- That's a nice move.
- Nice car.
This baby hasn't let me down yet.
She's an ugly little bitch,
but she gets you there.
Hey, Bond, you do any gardening?
Hand me that wrench, Jimmy?
- What do you know about Janus?
- Zilch. Zipsky.
No one's ever seen him.
But the man's connected up the kazoo.
KGB, military.
Screwdriver.
Rumor has it, he lives on one of
those old Soviet missile trains...
that armored stuff they ran around
the country so we couldn't target them.
Want to hand me
that hammer, Jimbo?
No, the bigger one.
The sledge.
Anyways, to tell the truth,
you don't find this guy. He finds you.
Hell, it's all Russian Mafia.
The best thing I can do is point you
in the direction of his competition.
- Who is the competition?
- An ex-KGB guy.
A tough mother. Got a limp on
his right leg. Name's Zukovsky.
- Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky?
- Yeah. You know him?
I gave him the limp.
Yes?
Are these all you have?
How many do you want?
Twenty-four for the American school,
eleven for the Swedish.
IBM compatible
with 500 meg. Hard drives...
CD ROM and 14.4 modems.
- Will you pay dollars?
- Of course.
If madame would require
a demonstration, I could...
Madame requires one demonstration model
and a quiet place to test it.
Natalya.
Is everything satisfactory?
Everything except the interruption.
Now let me get you straight, Jimmy.
You shot him in the leg,
you stole his car, you took his girl.
And now you want Valentin Zukovsky
to set you up with Janus?
Yes.
Well, what are you going to do?
Appeal to his heart?
No, his wallet.
Oh, that might work.
Okay, show time.
Valentin operates out of
building number 23 there.
Are you sure
you want to do this?
Last guy who dropped in uninvited
went home airfreight...
in very small boxes.
Make sure they
send me home first-class.
Natalya, it's me!
It's Boris!
It's Boris! It's Boris!
Hello.
Another morning shot to hell.
Free market economy.
I swear it will be the end of me.
Walther PPK,
Only three men I know
use such a gun.
I believe I've killed
two of them.
Lucky me.
I think not.
James Bond.
Charming, sophisticated
secret agent.
Shaken but not stirred.
I see you haven't lost your
delicate sense of humor, Valentin, huh?
Or your need for an audience.
Who's strangling the cat?
Strangling a cat?
That is Irina, my mistress.
A very talented girl.
Irina! Take a hike!
So, Mr. Bond...
what is it that brings you
to my neighborhood, hmm?
Still working for Ml6...
or have you decided
to join the 21st century?
I hear the new M is a lady.
I want you to do me a favor.
He wants me to do him a favor!
My knee aches...
every single day,
twice as bad when it is cold.
Have you any idea how long
the winter lasts in this country, hmm?
Tell him, Dimitri!
- Well, it depends...
- Silence!
For an ex-KGB agent,
you surprise me, Valentin.
Someone of your stature must've realized
the skill was not to hit your knee...
but to...
miss the rest of you.
So why did you not kill me?
Call it professional courtesy.
Then I should extend you
the same courtesy.
Kirov's funeral parlor,
Two hundred pounds of C4 explosives
hidden in a casket.
Your man drives the hearse in,
the money's exchanged...
their man drives the hearse out.
Their man will be arrested
with the explosives.
Your man will make
a miraculous escape with the money.
Your money.
And what do I owe
for this accommodation?
I want you to set me up...
with Janus.
What has he done to deserve you?
- Stole a helicopter.
- I have six.
Three. None that fly.
Who's counting?
These are not just criminals,
Valentin, they're traitors.
They used the chopper
to steal a nuclear weapon.
Killed a lot of
innocent Russians doing it.
- What do you expect from a Cossack?
- Who?
This Janus, I've never met the man,
but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.
Group that worked for the Nazis
against the Russians, Second World War.
You know your history, Mr. Bond.
At the end of the war...
the Lienz Cossacks surrendered
to the British in Austria...
believing they'd join your government
and wage war against the communists.
But, the British betrayed them...
sent them promptly back to Stalin
who promptly had them all shot...
women, children, families.
Not exactly our finest hour.
Still, ruthless people.
They got what they deserved.
I want you to set me up with Janus.
Tell him I'm asking about the chopper.
You're going to meet me tonight
at the Grand Hotel Europe.
And then, you and I are even
and he owes me one?
Precisely.
You don't need the gun,
Commander.
That depends on your definition
of 'safe sex. '
That's close enough.
Not for what I have in mind.
Oh, you think you can hurt me?
You think you can break me?
Yes! Yes!
Yes!
No, no, no.
No more foreplay.
Take me to Janus.
- This is it?
- Yes.
Well, I must say,
I've had a lovely evening. You?
Well, once again,
the pleasure was all yours.
You'll understand
if I don't call.
I won't lose sleep over it.
Sweet dreams.
Hello, James.
- Alec?
- Back from the dead.
No longer just an anonymous star
on the memorial wall at Ml6.
What's the matter, James?
No glib remark?
No pithy comeback?
Why?
Hilarious question,
particularly from you.
Did you ever ask why?
Why we toppled all those dictators,
undermined all those regimes?
Only to come home: 'Well done, good job.
But sorry, old boy.
Everything you risked your life
and limb for has changed. '
- It was the job we were chosen for.
- Of course you'd say that.
James Bond,
Her Majesty's Ioyal terrier...
defender of the
so-called 'faith. '
Oh, please, James, put it away.
It's insulting to think I haven't
anticipated your every move.
Yes.
- I trusted you, Alec.
- Trust?
What a quaint idea.
How did the Ml6 screening miss
that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?
Once again, your faith is misplaced.
They knew.
We're both orphans, James.
But where your parents had the luxury
of dying in a climbing accident...
mine survived the British betrayal
and Stalin's execution squads.
But my father couldn't let himself,
or my mother, live with the shame of it.
Ml6 figured I was
too young to remember.
And in one of life's
little ironies...
the son went to work for
the government whose betrayal...
caused the father
to kill himself and his wife.
Hence, Janus.
The two-faced Roman god
come to life.
It wasn't God who gave me this face,
it was you...
setting the timers for three minutes
instead of six.
Am I supposed
to feel sorry for you?
No. You're supposed
to die for me.
Oh, by the way...
I did think of asking you
to join my little scheme...
but somehow I knew...
never to his friend.
Closing time, James.
Last call.
For England, James.
Wake up!
Mister!
Wake up, please!
- Wake up!
- I'm here.
- I'm here!
- Hurry!
Hurry up! Come out!
Pull yourself together!
We're going to die!
Do something!
Get us out of here!
I'm a little tied up...
Never mind.
The things that we do
for 'frequent flyer' mileage.
Here, let me help you.
That's it, mind your head.
Let me go!
Who are you?
Listen, I'm on your side.
I'm here to help you.
- I don't know anything.
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care what you believe.
- Look!
They might be back for us any minute.
You either take your chances with me...
or your fellow countrymen
who killed everyone at Severnaya.
I've never been to Severnaya.
Your watch has.
Frozen by the GoldenEye blast.
And I'm willing to bet you're the one
who climbed up the dish to get out.
- Who are you?
- I work for the British government.
And the more you tell me,
the more I can help you.
- But I don't know anything!
- Then let's start with what you do know.
My name is Natalya Simonova.
I was a systems programmer
at Severnaya facility until...
Go on.
- Until they killed everyone.
- Who? Alec Trevelyan?
No. I don't know who that is.
Who was the insider?
Who was the traitor?
Boris.
Boris Grishenko.
- KGB or military?
- Computer programmer.
- There was no one else?
- No.
They're going to kill me,
aren't they?
Trust me.
Trust you?
I don't even know your name.
Good morning, Mr. Bond.
Sit.
I'm Defense Minister
Dimitri Mishkin.
So, by what means shall we
execute you, Commander Bond?
What, no small talk?
No chitchat?
That's the trouble with the world today.
No one takes the time to do a sinister
interrogation anymore. It's a lost art.
Your sense of humor doesn't slay me,
Commander. I'm sorry.
- Where is the GoldenEye?
- I assumed you had it.
I have an English spy, a Severnaya
programmer and the helicopter they took.
That's what some traitor in your
government wanted it to look like.
- Who was behind the attack on Severnaya?
- Who had the authorization codes?
Russia may have changed, but the
penalty for terrorism is still death!
- And what's the penalty for treason?
- Stop it, both of you! Stop it!
You're like boys with toys.
It was Ourumov.
General Ourumov set off the weapon.
I saw him do it.
Are you certain it was Ourumov?
Yes. He killed everyone
and stole the GoldenEye.
And why would he do that?
There is another satellite.
Another GoldenEye?
Thank you, Miss Simonova.
You were saying something about
the lost art of interrogation, Mr. Bond?
Defense Minister, I must protest!
This is my investigation.
You are out of order.
From what I am hearing,
it is you who's out of order!
- I have seen this gun before.
- Put it down.
- In the hand of our enemy.
- Put it down, General!
Do you even know who
the enemy is, Dimitri?
- Do you?
- Guard!
Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin...
murdered by a British agent,
James Bond.
Himself shot while
trying to escape. Guards!
Come on!
They're in the archives!
Down!
Spread out!
Cover the other side!
Trust me.
Go now!
Faster!
Damn it!
Down the alley!
Use the bumper!
That's what it's for!
What was that?
Go left!
Get out!
Either you've brought me
the perfect gift, General Ourumov...
or you've made me
a very unhappy man.
Mishkin got to them
before I could.
Bond is alive?
He escaped.
Good for Bond.
Bad for you.
Take a seat, my dear.
You know, James and I
shared everything.
Absolutely everything.
To the victor go the spoils.
You'll like it where we're going.
You may even learn to like me.
Stay with her.
Bond.
Only Bond.
He's going to derail us.
Full speed!
Full speed! Ram him!
Why can't you just be
a good boy and die?
You first.
You... second.
Up!
Situation analysis: hopeless.
You have no backup,
no escape route.
And I have the only
bargaining chip.
Where is she?
Oh, yes.
Your fatal weakness.
Ourumov, bring her in.
Lovely girl.
Tastes like...
like strawberries.
- I wouldn't know.
- I would.
So, back where we started, James.
Your friend or the mission.
Drop the gun.
I'll let her live.
Ourumov, what has this
Cossack promised you?
You knew, didn't you?
He's a Lienz Cossack.
- It's in the past.
- He'll betray you!
- Just like everyone else.
- Is this true?
What's true is that in 48 hours
you and I will have more money than God.
And Mr. Bond here will have
a small memorial service...
with only Moneypenny and a few
tearful restaurateurs in attendance.
So, what's the choice, James?
Two targets.
Time enough for one shot.
The girl, or the mission?
Kill her.
She means nothing to me.
See you in hell, James.
One-inch armor plating.
I'm fine,
thank you very much!
- Boris, yes!
- What are you doing?
Boris is on-line,
backing up his files.
If I can spike him, I might be able
to find out where they're going.
But don't stand there!
Get us out of here!
Yes, sir.
Good luck with the floor, James.
I set the timers for six minutes...
the same six minutes you gave me.
It was the least
I could do for a friend.
- What does that mean?
- We've got three minutes.
What else do you call your butt?
- What?
- It's Boris' password.
He plays word games: 'What I sit on,
but I don't take it with me. '
- Chair.
- Like I said.
Thirty seconds.
He's not in Russia, Germany,
Paris, London, Madrid.
Twenty-five seconds.
New York, Toronto, Chicago,
San Francisco.
Twenty seconds!
Mexico City, Rio, Miami.
- Come on!
- Wait!
He's in Cuba, Havana. No.
Now!
Do you destroy every vehicle
you get into?
Standard operating procedure.
'Boys with toys. '
Maybe I should take care of
the transportation for our trip to Cuba.
Our trip?
Do you know how
to disarm the weapon?
I suppose that depends on what kind of
weapon you're talking about disarming.
So, tell me.
Are there any other
standard operating procedures...
I should be aware of, Commander?
Thousands.
But I only pay them...
lip service.
My whole life, I dreamed about
coming to the Caribbean.
It's so beautiful.
Not another human being in sight.
What is it with you
and moving vehicles?
Yo, Jimbo!
Brought a little gift from
old what's-his-name, uh, T, Z...?
- Q.
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here, Wade?
- Banyan trees.
I am not here.
The CIA has no knowledge, no
involvement, absolutely nothing to do...
with your insertion into Cuba,
if you catch my drift.
Yes, I do, perfectly.
Borrowed the plane from
a friend of mine in the DEA.
Now, the Coast Guard
and the FAA are both in the loop.
You're cleared on our radar
for 0600 hours.
Here's the latest Sat-Int
from Langley.
- Stay below 600 feet.
- 500 feet.
- Who's that?
- Natalya Siminova.
Natalya Simonova.
Russian Minister of Transportation.
Did you check her out?
- Head to toe.
- Right.
So, you're looking for a dish
the size of a football field, huh?
Doesn't exist. You can't light a cigar
in Cuba without us seeing it.
I know it's there.
It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like your
secret transmitters in New Zealand.
I've never been to New Zealand.
How'd she know about that?
What if I need backup?
Get on the radio.
I'll send in the Marines.
Anyway, hang a left
at the end of the runway.
- Cuba's 80 miles on your right.
- Yo, Wade.
Just one thing: Don't push
any of the buttons on that car.
- I was going to go bombing around in it.
- Exactly.
Yo, James, I got faith.
But be careful. He knows you're coming.
He was your friend, Trevelyan?
And now he's your enemy
and you will kill him.
It is that simple?
In a word, yes.
Unless he kills you first.
- Natalya...
- You think I'm impressed?
All of you with your guns,
your killing, your death. For what?
So you can be a hero?
- All the heroes I know are dead.
- Natalya, listen to me.
How can you act like this?
How can you be so cold?
It's what keeps me alive.
No.
It's what keeps you alone.
James?
Yes?
On the train...
when you told him to kill me
and I meant nothing to you...
did you mean it?
Yes.
Basic rule:
always call their bluff.
No.
Turn ten degrees south,
bearing one-eight-four.
Yes, sir.
Nothing.
There is nothing here.
Let's make another pass.
Maybe Wade was right.
There is no dish.
Natalya.
This time, Mr. Bond,
the pleasure will be all mine.
Wait for your turn.
She always did enjoy
a good squeeze.
Is the satellite in range?
- Six minutes.
- Prepare the dish.
No! It's too early.
I am not ready.
Do it!
No wonder we couldn't see it.
Come on.
The world's greatest cash card.
It had better not be rejected.
- Mischa is on-line.
- Sir.
Kill him!
The man just won't take a hint.
- Target coordinates?
- The target is London.
He's getting ready
to signal the satellite.
- How do you stop it?
- The transmitter above the antenna...
Antenna in position.
On my count.
Three... two... one.
God save the Queen.
The mainframe computer.
Don't move.
James!
What an unpleasant surprise.
- We aim to please.
- Where's the girl?
Find her!
So, how is old Q?
Up to his usual tricks?
The watch.
A new model.
Still press here, do I?
Interesting setup, Alec.
You break into the Bank of England
via computer...
and then transfer
the money electronically...
just seconds before
you set off the GoldenEye...
which erases any record
of the transactions.
- Ingenious.
- Thank you, James.
But it still boils down
to petty theft.
In the end,
you're just a bank robber.
Nothing more
than a common thief.
You always did have
a small mind, James.
It's not just
erasing bank records.
It's everything on every computer
in Greater London:
tax records, the stock market,
credit ratings, land registries...
criminal records.
In 16 minutes and 43 sec...
No, 42 seconds... the United Kingdom
will reenter the Stone Age.
A worldwide financial meltdown.
And all so mad little Alec can settle
a score with the world 50 years on.
Oh, please, James.
Spare me the Freud.
I might as well ask you if all the vodka
martinis ever silence the screams...
of all the men you've killed.
Or if you find forgiveness in the arms
of all those willing women...
for all the dead ones
you failed to protect.
England is about to learn
the cost of betrayal...
inflation-adjusted for 1945.
- Welcome to the party, my dear.
- Natalya!
Don't ever do that again!
This is not one of
your games, Boris.
Real people will die!
You pathetic little worm.
She was in the mainframe.
Check the computer.
She's a moron.
A second-level programmer.
She works on
the guidance system.
She doesn't even have access
to the firing codes.
Retrorockets firing!
What the hell's happening?
We will have reentry in...
- It will burn up over the Atlantic.
- Deal with it!
She changed the access codes!
Well, then she can fix it.
Go ahead, shoot him.
He means nothing to me.
I can do it!
- I can break her codes.
- Then get on with it!
Tell him, now!
Give me the codes, Natalya!
Give them to me!
- Can Boris break your codes?
- Possibly.
Possibly?
We have to destroy
the transmitter.
By the way,
I'm fine, thank you very much.
Do you know how
to use one of these?
Yes.
Good.
Stay out of sight.
- How long?
- Two minutes. One minute.
- Guard!
- I'm fixing it!
If he moves, kill him.
Yes! I am invincible!
You know, James...
I was always better.
Alpha One to Gunship.
Alpha One to Gunship!
Speak to me!
For England, James?
No.
For me.
Yes! I am invincible!
James! James!
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine, thank you.
Suppose someone is watching?
No. There's no one
within 25 miles, believe me.
Yo, Jimbo!
Is this supposed to be your idea of, uh,
coming through in a clinch?
It's tobacco plants.
I said I'd be here, huh?
Yo! Marines!
Maybe you two would like to finish
debriefing each other at Guantanamo.
Maybe you two would like to finish
debriefing each other at Guantanamo.
- You ready?
- I'm not going on a helicopter with you.
No plane, no train,
nothing that moves.
Darling, what could
possible go wrong, eh?
Our man's in position
on the center camera.
It's like a terrorist supermarket.
Chinese Long March Scud,
Panther AS-565 attack helicopter...
...a pair of Russian mortars, and
the crates look like American rifles.
Chilean mines, German explosives.
Fun for the whole family.
IDs.
White Rook to White Knight.
Show us the pawns.
You see, he did get through, admiral.
Start with that chap in the middle.
Load the ID program, please.
Database ID search.
Checking the databases.
We've got our first match.
Satoshi Isagura.
Chemical expert.
Wanted for the Tokyo subway attack.
Currently working for
the insurgent force in Zaire.
Henry Gupta. American.
Practically invented
techno-terrorism.
Started out as a student radical
at Berkeley in the '60s.
Now he sells his politics for cash.
- Zoom in on that, can you?
- That looks like an American encoder.
They use it to control navigation
satellites: The GPS system.
Will the CIA be more upset
that they lost it or that we found it?
Excuse me. Admiral?
Thank you, M, we've seen enough.
This is now a military operation.
You saw the Gatling gun?
Are your troops prepared
for that kind of firepower?
We have election
in Moscow next week.
The president said any loss
of life is unacceptable.
We'll take the naval option.
In one strike, we take out
half the world's terrorists.
- Admiral Roebuck, I must protest.
- Get me the Chester,
- Let's not waste time.
- My man isn't finished.
Black King to White Bishop.
Authorization to fire.
Get your man out of there.
His job is over.
Weapons authorized,
Prepare to fire,
On my count.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Missile away.
Time to target:
Four minutes, eight seconds.
White Knight, four minutes to impact.
Get out of there.
Yes, damn it, I know what it is.
It's on the screen in front of me.
It's a jeep in front of a plane.
Now, get the hell out of there!
- What the hell's going on?
- You will not wait!
- That's an order!
- What is your man waiting for?
White Knight? Oh, my God!
Those are Soviet SB-5
nuclear torpedoes.
- lf the cruise hits them...
- Order them to abort the missile.
- H, M, S, Chester, urgent.
- White Knight, come in.
Abort missile. Abort missile.
- Abort missile.
- Abort missile.
Captain, sir, missile out of range.
Unable to destroy,
- White Knight...
- Alert NATO, the Pentagon.
- Will it trigger the torpedoes?
- It might.
But even if it does not,
there's enough plutonium...
...to make Chernobyl
look like picnic.
Bloody hell. Can't you people
keep anything locked up?
Evacuate your troops,
and get him out of there, now.
White Knight, come in.
White Knight, come in.
- Keep trying, damn it.
- White Knight, come in.
Repeat, White Knight, come in.
Filthy habit.
I've got the encoder.
- What the hell is he doing?
- His job.
He's going for the bombs.
Get that jeep!
Get out of it, James.
One minute to impact.
Thirty seconds to impact.
Back-seat driver.
White Knight to White Rook.
I've evacuated the area,
Ask the admiral where
he'd like his bombs delivered,
Sound the general alarm.
The ship has been overflown
by two Chinese MiGs,
We believe they have hostile intent.
Hands to action stations,
Officer of the watch, maximum speed.
Come left 40 degrees.
Aye, aye, sir.
Revolutions 1-6-0, port 20.
Are they insane?
The Chinese pilot insists that
we are only 11 miles off their coast...
...and he will fire if we don't
turn around and go to a Chinese port.
Send this:
"We are in international waters...
...and will defend ourselves
if attacked.
Copy all this
to the Admiralty, urgent.
Are we absolutely sure
of our position?
Yes, sir. An exact satellite fix.
Captain, we are ready to launch.
Shut down the engines.
Maintain full silence.
A stealth ship may be invisible
to radar but the sea drill isn't.
We'll launch next time
the MiGs fly by...
...and the British will think
it's a Chinese aerial torpedo.
I should report in.
Stamper to Hamburg,
Phase one is in progress,
I'll report back to you
with an update,
- The MiGs are making another pass.
- Let's start the show.
Sea drill in position.
Start the drill.
- Release it.
- Sea drill away.
Green 3-0,
torpedo, torpedo, torpedo.
Green 3-0, center bearing 1-1-4.
Officer of the Watch,
come hard right, 1-4-1.
There's been no sonar contact, sir.
The MiGs must have dropped it.
Bearing steady. It's gonna hit, sir.
Brace, brace, brace.
- Target: 1200.
- Knock, knock.
Let's go upstairs.
- Turn left.
- Rotating 90 degrees.
Now they're wondering why
the torpedo hasn't exploded.
PWO, captain.
Full damage report.
Backup power, immediately!
Switch to alternate supply.
Three generators are down, sir.
Flooding on four deck aft.
Sir, we're now down
Yeoman, send to Admiralty:
"Have been torpedoed by
Chinese MiGs. Sinking."
Give them our position.
Right. Abandon ship.
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
Everyone on deck! Come on!
One missile at the MiGs.
Maintaining radio silence.
Their last broadcast, sir.
Mr. Gupta's little trick
with the encoder worked.
They gave their final position
The British Navy
will never find them.
Survivors in the water.
Mr. Stamper,
I'm having fun with my headlines.
I need to know
the exact number of survivors.
Now, I'm late for a meeting. Make sure
you use the right kind of ammunition.
Yes, sir,
Delicious.
Start the recovery operation.
Send our divers
down to the Devonshire,
Mr, Gupta? Phase one is complete,
Good morning, my golden retrievers.
What kind of havoc shall the Carver
Media Group create in the world today?
- News.
- Floods in Pakistan, riots in Paris,
- And a plane crash in California,
- Excellent.
Mr. Jones, are we ready
to release our new software?
Yes, sir,
As requested, it's full of bugs,,,
,,, which means people will be
forced to upgrade for years,
Outstanding.
Mr. Wallace, call the president.
Tell him if he doesn't sign the bill
lowering the cable rates...
...we'll release a video of him
with the cheerleader...
...in the Chicago motel room.
- Inspired, sir,
After he signs the bill,
release the tape anyway.
Consider him slimed,
Excuse me.
- He's on transponder seven.
- Mr. Stamper?
Phase two is underway,
I have the videotape,
I haven't seen it myself,
but I'm told the footage is excellent,
Plus, there were 17 survivors
for your headlines,
Good work, Stamper.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
Make sure you keep it
in a safe place.
Gentlemen and ladies...
...hold the presses.
This just in.
By a curious quirk of fate,
we have the perfect story...
...with which to launch our
Satellite News Network tonight.
It seems a small crisis is brewing
in the South China Seas.
I want full newspaper coverage.
I want magazine stories.
I want books. I want films.
I want TV. I want radio.
I want us on the air
This is our moment!
And a billion people
around this planet...
...will watch it, hear it...
...and read about it
from the Carver Media Group.
There's no news like bad news.
How do you say
"I'm not here" in Danish?
Just ignore it.
Those are words they just
don't have in their vocabulary.
- Bond here.
- Go to a secure line, 007,
Going to scrambler, channel four.
That's ridiculous.
That ship was in international waters.
- We can't be certain.
- James? Where are you?
Oh, Moneypenny.
I'm just up here at Oxford
brushing up on a little Danish.
Little?
I'm afraid you're gonna have to
kiss off your lesson,
We've got a situation here
at the Ministry of Defense.
We're sending the fleet to China.
I'll be there in an hour.
Make that 30 minutes.
You always were
a cunning linguist, James.
- Don't ask.
- Don't tell.
That's preposterous. We know exactly
where that ship was positioned.
The GPS system... Global
Positioning Satellites do not lie.
Yes, but our Singapore station
picked up a mysterious signal...
...on the GPS frequency
at the time of the attack.
It could've sent that ship
off course.
- I have a missing British frigate...
- I'm aware of that!
And instead of decisive action,
all you wanna do is investigate.
My goal is to prevent World War III,
admiral, and I don't think...
...sending an armada into the recovery
area is the best way to do it.
Where, exactly, did this mysterious
GPS signal come from?
- We're still investigating.
- "Investigating."
M, sometimes I don't think
you have the balls for this job.
Perhaps, but the advantage is...
...I don't have to think
with them all the time.
That's enough.
Now, where do we stand?
It was an unprovoked attack
on a ship in international waters.
We send in the fleet for recovery
and prepare for full retaliation.
Moderation. We investigate...
...and stop short of sending
the entire British Navy...
...within 10 minutes
of the world's largest air force.
- When will our ships be in position?
- Forty-eight hours.
Christ!
The press are already
screaming for blood.
The last thing we want to do
is escalate the situation.
I'm afraid it may be too late
to worry about that.
Seventeen British sailors murdered!
"According to Vietnamese officials
who recovered the bodies...
...the victims were riddled
with the same ammunition...
...used by the Chinese Air Force.
- Did you leak this?
No.
- It's the first I've heard of it.
- Well, this settles it.
We send in the fleet.
M, you have 48 hours to investigate.
There is one strange thing.
When I called our contact
in Saigon, he said the Vietnamese...
...only found our sailors
three hours ago.
How'd they get the paper out
so fast?
Somebody at Tomorrow knew before
the Vietnamese government did.
How much do you know
about Elliot Carver, 007?
Worldwide media baron.
Able to topple governments
with a single broadcast.
Carver owns
that newspaper Tomorrow,
I didn't want to discuss it
in front of the minister...
...but that mysterious signal came
from one of Carver's satellites.
The PM would have my head
if he knew you were investigating him.
I'm sending you to Hamburg, 007.
We've arranged for your invitation...
...to a party
at Carver's Media center.
They're celebrating the launch
of a new satellite...
...because now he has the ability
to reach every human on the Earth.
Except the Chinese,
who have refused broadcast rights.
James, your ticket, cover story
and rental car reservation.
Sign here, please.
I believe you once had a relationship
with Carver's wife, Paris.
That was a long time ago, M...
...before she was married.
I didn't realize
it was public knowledge.
Queen and country, James.
Your job is to find out whether Carver
or someone in his organization...
...sent that ship off course
and why.
Use your relationship
with Mrs. Carver if necessary.
I doubt if she'll remember me.
Remind her.
Then pump her for information.
You'll just have to decide
how much pumping is needed, James.
If only that were true
of you and I, Moneypenny.
If you'll just sign here, Mr. Bond.
It's the insurance damage waiver...
...for your beautiful new car.
- Will you need collision coverage?
- Yes.
Fire?
Probably.
- Property destruction?
- Definitely.
Personal injury?
I hope not, but accidents do happen.
They frequently do with you.
Well, that takes care
of the normal wear and tear.
Do I need any other protection?
Only from me, 007, unless you bring
that car back in pristine order.
- Shall we?
- Shall we?
Your new BMW 750.
All the usual refinements.
Machine guns, rockets...
...the GPS tracking system.
Welcome, Please fasten seat belt and
obey all instructions for a safe trip,
I thought you'd pay more attention
to a female voice.
- I think we've met.
- I am not interested...
...in your sordid escapades.
Let's get on with it, shall we?
Your new telephone.
Talk here, listen here.
So that's what I've been
doing wrong all these years.
It also includes
a fingerprint scanner...
...and a 20,000-volt
security system.
And this I'm particularly proud of:
The remote control for your car.
Tap twice.
One, two.
Now, draw your finger...
...very slowly across the pad...
...to drive the car.
It's surprisingly difficult to drive,
but with practice...
Well, let's see how she responds
to my touch, eh, Q?
I think we understand each other.
Grow up, 007.
Attention, Engine running,
Please shut door now,
Anyway, there's absolutely no truth
in this malicious rumor...
...that I started running
Mad Cow Disease stories...
...simply because Sir Angus Black,
the great British beef baron...
...lost 10,000 pounds to me in a game
of poker and refused to pay up.
Moreover, there's even
less truth in the rumor...
...that I took 100 million francs
from the French...
...to keep the stories running
for another year.
- Excuse me, Mr. Carver.
- Yes.
This is the new banker, Mr?
Bond. James Bond.
Another new banker.
I seem to collect them.
Tell me, Mr. Bond...
...how's the market reacting
to the crisis?
Well, currencies are off.
Your stock is soaring.
I don't believe we have met.
- Elliot Carver.
- Wai Lin.
I'm from the
New China News Agency.
I don't recall seeing your name
on the guest list.
I have a confession.
It's not. I snuck in.
Why would you do that, my dear?
I wanted to meet you.
Outstanding.
I admire a woman
who takes the initiative.
You should work in
my Beijing bureau.
Mr. Carver.
- You don't have a bureau in Beijing.
- Call me Elliot.
I always wondered how I'd feel
if I ever saw you again.
Now I know.
Was it something I said?
How about the words
"I'll be right back"?
- Something came up.
- Something always came up.
- And how are you, Paris?
- Much better now. We're even.
Something to drink, Mrs. Carver?
Mr. Bond will have a vodka martini,
shaken not stirred.
Mrs. Carver will have a tequila,
straight shot.
No, Mrs. Carver will have a glass
of Mr. Carver's champagne.
I see you've moved up
in the world, Paris.
And tonight, you're a banker.
I saw the guest list.
Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?
- To you.
- No, to the gun.
So I take it this isn't a social visit?
Your husband may be in trouble.
The emperor of the air.
If you think you're going after him,
you're the one who's in trouble.
Perhaps, but it's either him
or someone in his organization.
I see. And you figured you could
charm the dirt out of me.
No. That wasn't my plan.
Good. Because if it
comes to a choice...
...between you and Elliot,
I've made my bed.
You don't sleep in it anymore.
There you are.
Darling.
I've been looking
everywhere for you.
I want you to meet Wai Lin,
New China News Agency.
- Hello, Mrs. Carver.
- It's a pleasure.
And this is James Bond.
I didn't realize you knew each other.
- We're old friends.
- Casual acquaintances.
He dated my roommate in Zurich.
I'm thinking of getting Wai Lin
behind a news desk.
That's wonderful.
I'm sure she won't resist...
...too much.
Tell me, Elliot, I was just
wondering about your satellites...
...the way you've positioned
yourself globally.
They're merely tools
for information, Mr. Bond.
Or disinformation.
Say, if you wanted to manipulate
the course of governments or people.
Or even a ship.
That's very interesting, Mr. Bond.
You have a vivid imagination
for a banker.
Perhaps I should commission you
to write a novel.
Oh, heavens, no.
I'd be lost at sea. Adrift.
Mr. Carver?
It's time to begin the festivities.
Excuse me. Darling?
So how do you really know him?
I told you, he's a banker.
I met him in Zurich.
You're a terrible liar, dear.
I have a problem with a banker.
Could I see you a moment?
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Carver's broadcast will begin
in 10 minutes in the main studio.
Exactly what kind of banking
do you specialize in, Mr. Bond?
Hostile takeovers. Shall we?
Carver must feel at home
in a room like this.
It's nice to talk to the world.
Looks like there's someone
who wants to talk to you.
Mr. Bond, you have
an urgent phone call.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are live in five...
...four, three, two...
Good evening.
Tonight's broadcast was supposed
to be a celebration...
...marking the completion of
the Carver Global Satellite Network.
But, as you're well aware...
...a terrible conflict looms tonight
in the South China Sea...
...which, unchecked...
...has the potential to destroy
every human being on Earth.
- I want to assure my viewers that I,,,
- This way, please.
,,, Elliot Carver, have spoken
with the prime minister in London,,,
,,, and the chairman in Beijing,,,
,,, and have offered my services
as an impartial...
It's a soundproof room, Mr. Bond.
Nobody hears you scream.
Herr Stamper,
we have made contact.
Make him uncomfortable.
I'll be there in a few moments.
- with its printing presses
that run 24 hours a day...
...and its satellite facilities
linking every last...
You seem very concerned
about Mr. Carver's business.
He wants to know why.
Why did I do it, you ask,
The answer is simple: power,
The power to illuminate
the far corners of the globe,
Not for higher profits,,,
...but for higher understanding between
the people of this great planet.
Put him in the chair. Maybe we play
a little number on his head.
And what do I expect in return?
Worldwide domination.
Complete, utter, total
worldwide domination,
But not over governments or ideology,
Over tyranny and isolation
and ignorance,
The Carver Media Group Network
has the ability,,,
,,, to reach every person
in every village in every nation,
But do not fear me,,,
,,, for tonight I offer you
my declaration of principles:
A promise to the men and women
of this planet,,,
,,, my brothers and sisters
whom I so humbly serve,
I promise to report the news
without fear or favor,
I promise to be a force
for good in this world,
Fighting injustice,
crushing intolerance,,,
,,, battling inhumanity,
- Striking a blow for freedom,
- It's time for...
...a station break.
- What's happening?
- We've lost power.
- We're off the air.
- What?!
Ladies and gentlemen, stay calm.
There's no need to go for the exit.
We will go on in a few minutes' time.
What do you mean, you don't know?
You're fired! Get out of my sight!
And, in a rather embarrassing note,,,
,,, scrappy media mogul Elliot Carver
was cut off the air tonight,,,
,,, in mid-speech during
the inaugural broadcast,,,
,,, of his Worldwide Satellite Network,
Sorry, Elliot,
but we didn't do it,
Glorious evening, wasn't it?
Come on, Elliot.
Ignore those people.
- Sometimes these things happen.
- Not to me.
Not to me!
When I was 16, I went to work
for a newspaper in Hong Kong.
It was a rag, but the editor
taught me one important lesson.
The key to a great story
is not who...
...or what or when...
...but why.
Your friend, Mr. Bond,
made a mess tonight.
- I want to know why.
- I told you, I barely know him.
Barely?
I was curious
who Carver would send.
He's on to you.
Well, we know where you stand.
You made your bed.
I'm standing in your doorway.
Then turn around and go home.
You can tell him you didn't
get anything out of me.
That's it? Go home?
I didn't ask you
to get involved in this.
It's too late for that.
Why did you marry him?
He told me he loved me.
That always sounds good.
Do you know I used to look in
the papers for your obituary?
Well, I'm sorry
I keep disappointing you.
What was it, James?
Did I get too close?
Did I get too close for comfort?
Yes.
I missed you.
What did you find?
I hacked into the mainframe
at the bank.
They're using
an SSL2 encryption, 128...
Spare me the technobabble, please.
Bond's got a perfect
employment record. Ten years.
He's crossed every T,
he's dotted every I.
- Which means?
- Government agent.
I call it
Gupta's Law of Creative Anomalies.
If it sounds too good to be true,
it always is.
Do you think my wife knows?
There's a lot of garbage, but
if you dial down the ambient noise...
Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?
Play it again.
Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?
I think we should set an appointment
for my wife with the doctor.
Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?
- I have to go.
- No, you don't.
I can get you out of the country
in four hours.
I have no choice.
No one can protect me
from him, not even you.
- You do have a choice.
- Only if you let him go.
I can't do that.
He has a secret lab on the top floor
even I'm not supposed to know about.
There's an emergency hatch
on the roof.
- You don't have to do this.
- It's the easiest way to get in.
Don't argue with me, James.
You know...
...this job of yours...
...it's murder on relationships.
Until I get back next week,
I want two guards...
...outside this office
Nobody gets in. Got it?
We'll take care of it.
What do we do with the satellite?
Send this thing to the launch site.
And be careful.
It's worth $300 million. You break it,
you bought it. Understand?
I hate traveling.
I never know what to pack.
Looking for a news story?
They'll print anything these days.
Yes?
Good morning, Mr, Bond,
Elliot Carver,
I believe you've got
two items that belong to me,
What are you talking about?
The red box, Mr, Bond,,,
,,, and my wife in your hotel room,
He's coming.
Fingerprint ID accepted,
Please select security system level,
Tell me if you find the encoder.
- Call me immediately,
- Yeah,
And in breaking news,,,
,,, it is with great sadness that we
announce the death of Paris Carver,,,
,,, who has become an international
figure since she became the wife,,,
,,, of Elliot Carver,
chairman of this network,
According to police officials
in Hamburg, Germany,,,
,,, Mrs, Carver was found dead
this morning,,,
,,, in a hotel suite in that city
in unusual circumstances,,,
,,, on which police
have refused to elaborate,
A coroner has been called for
and is expected to deliver,,,
,,, his full report within
the next three days,
Her body was discovered along with
the body of an unidentified man,,,
,,, who appeared to be the victim
of a self-inflicted gun wound,
Reached aboard his private jet
en route...
I have a clear shot at your head,
Mr. Bond.
Stand up, slowly.
Drop your gun and
kick it toward me, ja?
At present, police
have refused to speculate,,,
,,, on a motive in this
murder-suicide,
Good. Now...
...lie down on the bed
next to Mrs. Carver.
We extend our deepest sympathies
to Mr, Carver,
This story will be
on the news in an hour.
- Tomorrow's news today.
- Just so.
My name is Dr. Kaufman.
I am an outstanding
pistol marksman.
Take my word for it, ja?
Get the sledgehammers.
She struggled terribly, Mr. Bond.
It's a pity you got her
involved in all this.
It won't look like a suicide
if you shoot me from over there.
I am a professor
of forensic medicine.
Believe me, Mr. Bond,
I could shoot you from Stuttgart...
...and still create the proper effect.
My art is in great demand,
Mr. Bond.
I go all over the world.
I am especially good
at the celebrity overdose.
But now, I'm afraid, Mr. Bond,
that our little...
Stamper! Stop yelling in my ear, ja?
Sir, they can't get into the car.
You can't be serious.
- Did you call the Auto Club?
- Do you wanna call them?
Make him tell you how to open it,
Okay, I ask.
This is very embarrassing.
It seems there is
a red box in your car.
They can't get to it.
They want me
to make you unlock the car.
I feel like an idiot.
I don't know what to say.
I am to torture you
if you don't do it.
- You have a doctorate in that too?
- No, no, no.
This is more like a hobby.
But I'm very gifted.
Oh, I believe you.
- My cell phone opens the car.
- No, Mr. Bond.
I do it, ja?
Recall, three, send.
Wait.
I'm just a professional doing a job.
Me too.
Dr. Kaufman.
Welcome, Please fasten seat belt,
Reduce speed,
Pedestrians in roadway,
Driver alert,
Obstruction ahead,
Reduce speed now,
Reminder:
Unsafe driving will void warranty,
Congratulations on a safe journey,
Yo! Jimbo!
Wade, what are you doing here?
You know the world's my office.
Let's go this way.
Did Q bring you up to speed?
Yeah. I brought along
the GPS calibration unit.
By the way, officially Uncle Sam
is neutral in this turkey shoot.
And unofficially?
We have no interest in seeing
World War III, unless we start it.
Dr. Greenwalt.
He's the Air Force GPS expert.
Sorry about all this security...
...but the GPS encoder is one of
the most closely guarded secrets...
...in the U.S. military.
Show him what you got.
Jesus, it's the missing encoder.
How the hell did you get that?
Picked it up in Hamburg
yesterday morning.
Could somebody use this
to send a ship off course?
- Like the Devonshire?
- Whoa!
I didn't hear anybody mention
the Devonshire, Did you?
- No.
- Good. So just answer his question.
Well, in theory, if you could alter
the timing chip...
...you could slowly
send a ship off course.
Like putting a magnet
near a compass.
Yeah, exactly.
- Then check this out.
- Oh, yeah.
Those two circles should be
lining up on top of each other.
Somebody's tampered
with your encoder.
If we knew the last time and position
the Devonshire thought she was...
...could you figure out
exactly where she sank?
Sure.
- Wade?
- Yeah?
I have a small favor to ask.
The high-altitude,
low-opening jump, the HALO jump...
...is where we get the most fatalities,
so listen up.
You free-fall for 5 miles and use your
oxygen, or you'll die of asphyxiation.
Sounds like my first marriage.
Next, after the free-fall...
...pop the chute at 200 feet,
below the Chinese radar.
You'll be traveling
at over 200 miles an hour.
This snaps your head back
like a cantaloupe.
Don't crack your skull open
on the tanks.
I'll keep that in mind.
One last thing: When you hit the water,
don't forget to cut away your chute.
Ninety percent of people
killed in HALO jumps...
...got tangled up in their chutes
and drowned. Got it?
Seems like a lot
just to save the world.
I've got no choice.
I have to prove that ship
was deliberately sent off course.
- One minute!
- Is the pickup set?
You bet. After your mission,
turn on your beacon.
The extraction team
will pick you up after dark.
Buddha bless!
- I just noticed something.
- Yeah?
This is where the ship
thought it was.
This is where it really is.
But see that island?
- Yeah.
- That means where he's jumping...
...between the British
and Chinese fleets...
Technically they're not
in Chinese territorial waters.
- They belong to Vietnam.
- Vietnam?
Does he have any
U.S. government markings on him?
The parachute,
the wet suit, the fins.
If the Vietnamese catch him,
they're gonna go crazy.
He didn't even say goodbye.
Still interested in hostile takeovers?
It's the opportunities for travel
that I like best about banking.
Get them out of the water.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you
were following me around, Mr. Bond.
You'll have to admit, though...
...we seem to have developed
a certain attachment to each other.
Hopefully not for long.
Another Carver building.
If I didn't know better, I'd say
he'd developed an edifice complex.
General Chang?
Friend of yours?
Mr. Bond. Miss Lin.
Welcome to Saigon.
It's always nice to see you, Elliot.
I hadn't intended opening
this center until tomorrow...
...but as you're here you can help me
write the inaugural story:
Your obituaries.
I hope you extended
the same courtesy to Paris.
Actually, Mr. Bond, you're the one
who wrote my late wife's obituary...
...when you asked her to betray me.
Still, let's see.
"British secret service agent
James Bond...
...and his collaborator Wai Lin...
...of the Chinese People's
External Security Force...
...were found...
...dead this morning...
...in Vietnam.
Lacks punch, don't you think?
It's old news, Elliot.
We've been working together
for months.
Both our governments know what you
and General Chang are up to.
I don't think so.
You may have seen the general
in the hallway just now...
...but perhaps,
with all your jetting around...
...you've not had chance to peruse
today's headlines.
I rather like the last one.
It isn't even mine.
I never believe what I read
in the press anyway.
Therein lies your problem, Mr. Bond.
You see, we're both men of action,
but your era and Miss Lin's is passing.
Words are the new weapons,
satellites the new artillery.
And you become the new
supreme allied commander?
Exactly!
Caesar had his legions,
Napoleon had his armies...
...I have my divisions.
TV, news, magazines.
And by midnight I'll have reached
and influenced more people...
...than anyone in the history
of this planet, save God Himself.
And the best he ever managed
was the Sermon on the Mount.
You really are quite insane.
The distance
between insanity and genius...
...is measured only by success.
Excuse me.
- General Chang is waiting.
- lf you'll forgive me...
Your appearance here has forced me
to move up my timetable slightly.
I'll leave you in the capable hands
of Mr. Stamper and his toys.
Perhaps you'd like to see them.
- Sir. The helicopter.
- Thanks, Gupta.
Mr. Stamper is a protg
of the late Dr. Kaufman...
...who was schooling him in
the ancient art of chakra torture.
He was like a father to me.
Really? Interesting role model.
According to Eastern philosophy,
the body has seven chakra points.
Energy centers,
like the heart or genitals.
The purpose of these implements
is to probe those organs...
...inflicting the maximum amount
of pain...
...whilst keeping the victim alive
for as long as possible.
Dr. Kaufman's record
was 52 hours.
I'm hoping to break it.
I would've thought watching
your TV shows was torture enough.
Save this one till last.
When you remove Mr. Bond's heart...
...there should just be enough time
for him to watch it stop beating.
Excuse me.
Go! Go! Go! Go!
We can use the banner.
Hope it holds.
- Get after them!
- Ready? Go!
Next time I'll take the elevator.
Push! Push!
- Get a car!
- No, no!
- Yes, a car!
- A bike is quicker.
The keys.
Someone always forgets them.
What are you doing?
I'm driving. Get off.
Get on the back.
I'm slipping.
Stop fidgeting back there.
What are you...?
Give me that.
Clutch! Clutch! Clutch!
- Turn right.
- No, left.
Who's driving? Come on!
Clutch!
Left! Left!
How many back there?
I can't see. Hold on.
What are you...? What?
- Don't get any ideas.
- I'd never dream of it.
One. No, two.
- Go for the barrels.
- What?
Very good.
Hold on!
Let's take the highway.
- Helicopter!
- All right, keep your shirt on.
- Get on the back of the bike.
- Are you trying to protect me?
No. I need to balance the bike.
Get on the back.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Go!
Pop the clutch.
- It's behind us.
- Move!
Get out of the way!
You see the chopper?
I can't see. Hold on.
What are you...?
Trapped.
Never.
Would you pass the soap?
Over there.
You were pretty good
with that hook.
It comes from growing up
in a rough neighborhood.
You were pretty good
on the bike.
Well, that comes from
not growing up at all.
Here. Allow me.
Don't get any ideas, Mr. Bond.
Just off the cuff,
I thought we might link up.
Work hand in hand?
Stick closer to each other.
Maybe we go after
General Chang together.
Your turn.
Thanks for washing my hair.
I work alone.
Lucky for you I stopped by.
I could've taken care of him.
But you didn't.
Give me the earring.
Copy of a Makarov 59.
Standard issue, Chinese army.
Looks like General Chang
wants you dead.
You still think
you can do this alone?
It depends whether your mission
is peace or revenge.
This is about stopping a war.
Last year we found
stealth material was missing...
...from one of
General Chang's bases.
I followed a lead
to Carver's headquarters in Hamburg.
Stealth material?
We thought he was building
a stealth plane.
No. Stealth boat.
That's the only way they could
get close to the Devonshire,,,
...so they could drill inside
the missile room.
Remember? They stole
a cruise missile from that ship.
He said he was moving the timetable
forward to midnight.
Yes, of course he did.
Under cover of darkness
he'll position the stealth boat...
...near the British fleet...
...fire the missile into China.
- And we will retaliate.
- And Carver will provide the pictures.
- I have to warn Beijing.
- No.
Let's warn both our governments,
get them talking.
It'll give us time to find the boat.
Stand up.
It's just like home.
You get the equipment,
I'll send the messages.
On second thought, you type.
First we have to find the boat.
Of all the harbors and inlets
controlled by General Chang...
...22 are in
highly populated areas.
That leaves 14
where he could hide a stealth boat.
You can see it during the day.
It's invisible to radar,
but not the human eye.
Very novel.
He'd have to hide it
someplace where...
...he could sail to the Devonshire
and back in one night.
This looks familiar.
- We've made some improvements.
- Have you, indeed?
Okay. Four hours out
and four hours back.
Assume the boat is traveling
at a speed of 30 knots.
I've always been a fan
of Chinese technology.
According to this...
...there are four places
where he could harbor the boat.
Up on your left.
Run a cross-check on those areas
for anything suspicious.
Ah, the new Walther.
I asked Q to get me one of these.
I've got it. Look.
Four missing boats.
Three unexplained drownings.
That has to be it.
Ha Long Bay.
He knows the island.
He says that it's dangerous for
boats to be around there at sunset...
...but for 5000 American dollars...
...he'll take us.
- Good.
Maybe he'll take a check.
It's mostly dull routine,
of course...
...but every now and then you get to
sail on a beautiful evening like this...
...and sometimes work with a decadent
agent of a corrupt Western power.
And they say Communists
don't know how to have fun.
I hate to disappoint you...
...but I don't even have
a little red book.
If anything happens to me...
...the fuses for the mines
are in here.
We're gonna finish this together.
And if I may say so,
you found the right...
...decadent, corrupt Western agent...
...as a partner.
- See the stealth?
- No.
It's getting late
and this is the last cove in the bay.
Yeah, that's it.
Set the timers for 10 minutes.
That'll give us time to get out of
here before the ship explodes.
Even if it doesn't sink,
it'll show up on radar.
- Our fleets will finish the job.
- lf they got our message.
- Okay, you, up and over.
- Okay.
We're in position
between the fleets,
Fire one missile
at the flagship of each fleet.
The Chinese will think the British
are rattling the saber...
...the British will think the Chinese
are being belligerent...
...and the media will provide
cool, objective coverage.
Let the mayhem begin.
Missile lock-on.
Send a signal to the Admiralty:
"Task group under missile attack."
Sir, AWACS reports two waves
of land-based MiG 21 s inbound.
The first group should be
on our screens in two minutes.
How long before the MiGs are within
firing range of the British fleet?
Twelve minutes.
What the hell do I pay you for?
If she's there, Bond is there.
Stamper, find them.
Wai Lin! Wai Lin! Camera!
If she blinks, kill her.
You come with me.
Stamper to Bridge, Bond is dead,
Delicious.
Make sure you clear all the mines,
and bring the girl up to me.
Are you sure you want her up here?
It's my business, Mr. Gupta.
I like an audience.
Ah, Miss Lin.
Your countrymen are being
so cooperative...
...so predictably eager
to save face.
My government knows you're
out here. They're looking for you.
Not according to our radar...
...where it seems your MiGs are
about to attack the British fleet...
...in how many minutes?
Nine minutes to firing range.
And even if they were
looking for me...
...we're on a stealth boat.
They can't see me, or you...
...or even your friend...
...the late Commander Bond...
...who is at this moment on his way
to the bottom of the South China Sea.
He's my new anchorman.
Pathetic.
What on earth's going on?
A message from 007...
...just confirmed by
my opposite number in China.
"Tell the fleet to search for a ship
that's almost invisible to radar."
The Chinese aren't the enemy.
Carver's been playing
both sides for fools.
Admiral, sir,
urgent message from the Admiralty.
Look at this.
Anything on radar that looks small?
Lifeboat, periscope, anything?
- No, sir.
- Stealth boat, sir? They've gone mad.
What you're about to witness, Miss
Lin, is not so much a missile attack...
...but the launch
of a new world order.
In five minutes, after your countrymen
have attacked the British fleet...
I shall retaliate
for dear old England...
...by sending this missile
into Beijing...
...where General Chang has just
called an emergency meeting...
...of the Chinese high command.
Unfortunately...
...General Chang
will be delayed in traffic...
...arriving just after the missile
has killed your leaders...
...and too late to stop the air force
from sinking the entire British fleet.
But he'll be just in time to take over
the government, negotiate a truce...
...and emerge as a world leader...
...with the Nobel Peace Prize.
- And what do you get?
- Me?
Oh, nothing.
Just exclusive broadcasting rights
in China for the next hundred years.
Ready to rock and ruin.
If you'll excuse me, my dear,
I have a deadline to meet.
Prepare for the missile launch.
Mr. Gupta.
Hello, Elliot.
Interesting plan.
But I think I have
something that belongs to you,
So much for German efficiency.
Mr. Stamper.
- Don't shoot him yet.
- Hold your fire.
Welcome to my world crisis,
Mr. Bond.
Even trade, Elliot.
Gupta for Wai Lin.
You can't fire the missile
without him.
And it seems you can't resist
any woman in my possession.
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him!
I told you we're going to
finish this together.
How romantic.
Do you realize
how absurd your position is?
No more absurd than
starting a war for ratings.
Great men have always manipulated
the media to save the world.
Look at William Randolph Hearst,
who told his photographers:
"You provide the pictures,
I'll provide the war."
I've just taken it one step further.
Sorry about that.
I tuned out there
for a moment, Elliot.
Touch.
Mr. Gupta...
...is the missile ready to fire?
Press the magic button,
Beijing disappears.
Then it seems
you've outlived your contract.
You see, Mr. Bond,
I have a backup plan.
So do I.
He's breached the hull.
They'll see us on radar.
Sir, we have a small,
intermittent contact on the surface.
Plot the bearing 1-1-2 degrees.
It's a very weak signal, but I'd swear
it wasn't there a second ago, sir.
Yeoman, tell all ships not to fire on the
Chinese for any reason whatsoever.
Send the message
to the Chinese fleet commander:
"Have sighted unknown ship..."
Get those fires out!
Get down there
and protect the missile.
Oh, and Mr. Stamper,
would you please kill those bastards?
Nice work.
They're speeding up.
- We have to stop the boat.
- Can you take care of the engine room?
- Of course.
- Good. Do it and get off the ship.
I'm going to stop the missile.
Signal from
the Chinese fleet commander.
"To Royal Navy Task Group:
We also have the unknown ship
on our screens.
We will not fire
unless it turns towards China.
Until then, she's yours.
Good hunting."
Now, captain, whatever
the hell that thing is, sink it.
Right, sir. Is that echo
too weak for missile lock?
- Yes, sir.
- Right.
We'll do it the old-fashioned way.
Bond turned us into the target.
Along with himself.
Take evasive action.
Prepare the missile countdown
immediately.
Initializing launch sequence.
T minus five minutes and counting.
T minus five minutes and counting,
Sir, they're making 48 knots.
They'll be out of range
in two minutes.
Keep firing. Slow them down.
The engines are out. We're sitting
ducks here. Engine room.
Follow me!
T minus four minutes and counting,
Well done.
Officer watch, increase max.
Keep firing!
All hands, abandon ship.
Abandon ship.
Abandon ship, Abandon ship,
Mr. Stamper,
what are you doing about the girl?
Perhaps you'd consider
looking in the engine room.
T minus three minutes and counting,
You're too late again, Mr. Bond.
It's a bad habit of yours.
There's nothing you can do.
T minus two minutes and counting,
The missile's fully programmed.
It can't be stopped.
In minutes my plan will succeed.
And thanks largely to your efforts...
...the British Navy
will destroy the evidence...
...and I'll be out of here
in a Carver news helicopter...
...covering the event.
It's going to be a fantastic show.
I may have some breaking news
for you, Elliot.
You forgot the first rule
of mass media, Elliot:
Give the people what they want.
T minus one minute and counting,
Drop it, Mr. Bond...
...or I drop your friend.
It's over, Stamper.
Let her go.
Not between you and me.
James, try the detonators.
The missile will set them off.
Never argue with a woman.
They're always right.
T minus 40 seconds,
For Carver!
And Kaufman!
I owe you an unpleasant death,
Mr. Bond.
T minus 20 seconds,
We die together, Mr. Bond.
T minus 10 seconds,
Three,,,
,,, two, one,
M, Bedford reports
Carver went down with the ship.
Seems that Bond made it.
Moneypenny, take this release.
Elliot Carver is missing,
presumed drowned...
...while on a cruise aboard his
luxury yacht in the South China Sea.
At present
the local authorities believe...
...the media mogul
committed suicide.
Commander Bond,,,
,,, Colonel Lin,,,
,,, this is the H.M.S. Bedford.
Are you there?
They're looking for us, James.
Let's stay undercover.
So good of you to come see me, Mr. Bond.
Particularly on such short notice.
lf you can't trust a Swiss banker,
what's the world come to?
Bon!
And now that we're all comfortable...
...why don't you sit down?
It was not easy...
...but I have retrieved the money.
No doubt Sir Robert will be
pleased to see it again.
At the current rate of exchange,
minus the fees and certain...
...unforeseeable expenses.
Voila, the receipt.
Would you like to check my figures?
I'm sure they're perfectly rounded.
It's all there.
I didn't come for the money.
The report Sir Robert bought was stolen...
...from an MI6 agent who was killed for it.
I want to know who killed him.
-Terrible tragedy.
-I just want a name.
I am merely the middleman.
I'm trying to do the honorable thing...
...returning the money to its rightful owner.
We know how difficult
that can be for a Swiss banker.
I am offering you the opportunity
to walk out with the money.
And I'm giving you the opportunity
to walk out with your life.
Looking at our present situation...
...as a banker, I'd have to say...
...that the numbers are not on your side.
Perhaps you failed to take into account...
...my hidden assets.
You've had a small reversal of fortune.
-Give me the name.
-I can't tell you.
Let's count to three.
You can do that, can't you?
One.
Two.
All right.
But you'll have to protect me--
James.
Have you brought me
a souvenir from your trip?
Chocolates?
An engagement ring?
I thought you'd enjoy one of these.
How romantic.
I know exactly where to put that.
Oh, Moneypenny.
The story of our relationship:
close, but no cigar.
I hate to tear you away from affairs of state.
Would you mind coming in?
Right away, M.
Sir Robert King, James Bond.
The man who retrieved my money.
Thank you. Excellent work.
Be careful, M.
I might steal him from you.
Construction's not exactly my specialty.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Best to the family.
Old friend?
We read law at Oxford together.
I always knew he'd conquer the world.
Care for a drink?
Yes, thank you.
He's a man of great integrity.
Who buys stolen reports
for 3 million pounds.
Thank you.
Any leads on the sniper?
Not one.
Professional job.
She must be working for someone.
-Is this the stolen report?
-Yes. Classified.
From the Russian Atomic Energy Department.
What would King want this for?
He was led to believe
the document was a secret report...
...identifying the terrorists
who'd attacked his new oil pipeline.
Interesting.
It doesn't explain why someone
would want me out of their office alive.
King! The money.
Moneypenny, stop King.
Move! Move, move!
Get out of the way!
Stop!
Move!
Get out of the way! Move!
Stop, stop!
It isn't finished!
Let go!
-What do you think you're--?
-Let go!
Listen to me!
You can't get away.
We can make a deal.
Tell me who's behind this...
...who you work for.
Don't do it!
Don't blow us up!
I can protect you.
Do you understand?
I can protect you.
Not from him!
Hello, my dear.
Who is that young woman?
King's daughter.
Elektra.
Thank you.
The money was dipped in urea.
A highly compacted fertilizer bomb.
Having handled the money,
the water on 007's hands...
...when he touched the ice,
started a chemical reaction.
In one note, the anti-counterfeiting strip
was replaced with magnesium...
...which acted as a detonator.
And King's lapel pin...
...was switched for a copy...
...which contained a radio transmitter
to trigger the blast.
In other words,
he set off the bomb that killed him.
We know it was someone close to King...
...and our only lead
committed suicide on that balloon.
But given the size of King's organization...
...it could be anyone, anywhere.
This will not stand.
We won't be terrorized by cowards
who'd murder an innocent man...
...and use us as the tool.
We'll find those who committed this atrocity.
We'll follow them to the farthest
ends of the earth, if needs be.
And we will bring them to justice.
Tanner!
M says you're off the active-duty list
until you're cleared by medical.
Dislocated collarbone.
If any more tendons snap,
I'm afraid you'll be out of action for weeks.
Molly...
...I need a clean bill of health.
You have to clear me for duty.
-That wouldn't really be--
-Ethical?
Practical.
Smart.
Well, let's just...
...skirt the issue, shall we?
You'd have to promise to call me...
...this time.
Whatever the doctor orders.
I suppose if you stayed in constant contact--
Of course.
If you showed sufficient stamina...
-...cut out all kinds of--
-Strenuous activity?
I suppose we all have to
pay the piper sometime, right, Q?
Oh, pipe down, 007.
Was it something I said?
No. Something you destroyed.
My fishing boat.
For my retirement...
...away from you.
Now, I want to introduce you
to the young fellow...
...I'm grooming to follow me.
Helps to open the door.
And you might be...?
This is 007.
If you're Q, does that make him R?
Yes, the legendary 007 wit.
Or at least half of it.
Now, I dare say, 007,
that you've met...
...your match with this machine.
New model? Improved specs?
I thought you were
on the inactive roster. Some injury?
We'll see about that.
As I was saying, the very latest
in interception countermeasures.
Titanium armor,
a multitasking heads-up display...
...and six beverage cup holders.
All in all, rather stocked.
''Fully loaded,'' I think is the term.
-I think--
-You're not here to think.
You're here to do what I tell you.
Now, go put on the coat...
...and demonstrate it for 007.
But of course.
Now watch closely, please, 007.
The right arm goes in the right sleeve, thus...
...and the left arm in the left sleeve, thus.
Note closely, please:
pockets, poppers and zipper.
Take the lower part of the zipper...
...and insert it into--
Pull the tag.
You said--
He seems well-suited for the job.
You're not retiring anytime soon...
...are you?
Now, pay attention, 007.
I've always tried to teach you two things:
First, never let them see you bleed.
And the second?
Always have an escape plan.
Good evening.
The Elektra King kidnap ordeal is over.
The Cyprus authorities say
she has escaped...
...after shooting dead
two of her captors and is--
He shouted.
Shouted all the time.
Level one clearance required.
Level one clearance required.
Yes, 007?
Tell me about
the kidnapping of Elektra King.
I wasn't aware
you had an assignment on this case.
I brought the money in that killed King.
-Don't make this personal.
-I'm not. Are you?
You're the only one who could seal her file.
Will you excuse us?
I will not tolerate insubordination, 007.
What happened?
After Elektra King was kidnapped...
...her father tried to deal with it on his own...
...with no success.
So he came to me.
As you are aware,
we do not negotiate with terrorists.
And against every instinct in my heart...
...every emotion as a mother...
...I told him not to pay the ransom.
I thought we had time on our side.
You used the girl as bait.
The money in King's briefcase
was the same amount...
...as the ransom demand for his daughter.
It's a message.
Your terrorist is back.
Victor Zokas.
A.k.a....
Renard.
The anarchist.
He was operating in Moscow in 1996.
Pyongyang, North Korea before that.
And he's been spotted...
...in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq,
Iran, Beirut and Cambodia.
All the romantic vacation spots.
His only goal is chaos.
After Robert came to me,
I sent 009 to kill Renard.
Before he completed the mission...
...Elektra escaped.
A week later, our man caught up with him.
He put a bullet in his head.
That bullet's still there.
How did he survive?
The doctor who saved Renard
couldn't get the bullet out...
...so Renard killed him.
It's moving through the medulla oblongata,
killing off his senses.
Touch, smell.
He feels no pain.
He can push himself harder,
longer than any normal man.
The bullet will kill him...
...but he'll grow stronger every day
until the day he dies.
Robert is dead.
MI6 is humiliated.
He's had his revenge.
Not quite.
Renard had three enemies in that kidnapping.
And there's still one he hasn't touched.
Elektra.
I see the good doctor has cleared you.
Notes you have exceptional stamina.
I'm sure she was touched by his dedication...
...to the job in hand.
She's taken over the construction
of her father's oil pipeline.
Find who switched that pin.
If your instincts are right,
Renard will be back...
...and Elektra will be the next target.
The worm on the hook again.
She doesn't need to know
the same man may be after her.
Don't frighten her.
A shadow operation?
Remember...
...shadows stay in front or behind.
Never on top.
You, go back. Leave.
This area is closed.
I'm here to see Elektra King.
James Bond, Universal Exports.
And I'm Davidov, chief of security.
We're having problems with the villagers.
I've told Miss King
to stay at the office in Baku.
Oh, hell.
-Miss King, I told you to--
-I know what you told me.
Send the pipe around.
It's going to take weeks and cost millions.
-Your father approved this route.
-Then my father was wrong. Do it.
-Davidov--
-I'll talk to her.
I saw you at my father's funeral.
I'm sorry.
M told me she was sending someone.
Mr...?
Bond.
James Bond.
Did you know my father?
I met him once, briefly.
You seem to have inherited
his touch for diplomacy.
Saving the church?
And avoiding the bloodshed.
discovered the oil here.
When the Soviet Union was formed...
...the Communists spent the next 70 years...
...plundering our countryside for it.
I saw their mess on the drive in.
The new pipeline will guarantee our future.
But it would be a crime
to destroy what little is left of our past.
But you didn't come here
to talk about oil, did you?
Tell me...
...have you ever lost a loved one, Mr. Bond?
M sent me because your life might be in danger.
Please, I want to show you something.
I'm trying to build
an 800-mile pipeline through Turkey...
...past the terrorists in Iraq...
...Iran and Syria.
Up here...
...the Russians have three competing pipelines...
...and they'll do anything to stop me.
My father was murdered,
the villagers are rioting...
...and you have come all this way...
...to tell me that I ''might'' be in danger?
We suspect there is an insider.
My father's pin.
No, a duplicate.
With a transmitter inside
that set off the bomb.
My family has relied on MI6 twice, Mr. Bond.
I won't make that mistake a third time.
I'm going to finish building this pipeline...
...and I don't need your help.
If you'll excuse me,
I have to check the survey lines.
I've always wanted
to check the survey lines.
You don't take no for an answer.
I hope you know how to ski, then.
I came prepared for a cold reception.
Can't land.
Wind's too strong.
Hold her steady.
You ski very well, Mr. Bond.
Seems you enjoy being chased.
Happens all the time.
Less often than you might think.
So this is where they meet...
...the two ends of the pipeline.
Your father's legacy.
My family's legacy...
...to the world.
-Expecting visitors?
-No.
This isn't a social call.
Head for the gully.
I'll lead them into the trees.
Go, go!
See you back at the lodge.
-It's all right.
-We're buried alive!
I can't stay here!
You're not going to.
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!
Look at me. Elektra, look at me!
Look at my eyes.
Look at my eyes.
Look at my eyes!
You're all right.
Everything's all right.
Trust me.
She's fine.
Some bumps and bruises,
but otherwise fine.
She wants to see you.
Not you, Davidov. Him.
Are you all right?
I need to ask you something.
And I want you to tell me the truth.
Who is it?
Who's trying to kill me?
I told you, I don't know.
But I'm gonna find him.
Not good enough.
After the kidnapping, I was afraid.
I was afraid to go outside.
I was afraid to be alone.
I was afraid to be in a crowd.
I was afraid to do anything at all.
Until I realized...
...I can't hide in the shadows.
I can't let fear run my life.
I won't.
After I find him...
...you won't have to.
Don't go.
Stay with me.
Please?
I can't do that.
I thought it was your job to protect me.
You'll be safe here.
I don't want to be safe.
I'll be back soon.
And who's afraid now, Mr. Bond?
I want to see Valentin Zukovsky.
Impossible.
Vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.
Tell him James Bond is here.
Now.
I don't think you heard me.
Mr. Zukovsky would be delighted to see you.
After you.
After you.
I insist.
And a little for you.
Bond! James Bond!
Meet Nina.
And Verushka.
Lose the girls, Valentin.
We need to talk.
Why am I suddenly worried that
I'm not carrying enough insurance?
Chill out, James.
Fine, ladies.
Go on. Beat it. Scram.
Bull, give them an inch.
And make sure they lose it in this casino.
I'll see you later, Mr. Bond.
I see you put your money
where your mouth is.
Mr. Bullion does not trust banks.
So what would you like to talk about?
I'm not sure I can really help you.
I'm a legitimate businessman now.
Would you care for some caviar?
My own brand: Zukovsky's Finest.
Look at this.
Russian Special Services.
Atomic Energy Antiterrorist Unit.
Where did you find this?
I took it off a Parahawk which tried
to kill Elektra King this morning.
Renard is behind this.
I think you and I had better have a drink.
And then after Afghanistan,
the KGB decided...
...Renard was a liability and just cut him loose.
Now he works freelance.
But for whom?
There are four competing pipelines.
I'm willing to bet
half the customers in this casino would be...
...very happy to see the King pipeline disappear.
-What's funny?
-Nothing. It appears...
...Miss King does not share your concern.
What are you doing here?
The same thing you are.
Looking for the people who tried to kill me.
Let me take you home. Now.
No. I want them to see I'm not frightened.
Miss King, how very nice to see you.
We've kept your father's chair free.
Free? Nothing comes free from you.
Your father had a credit line with us.
One million U.S.
I'd be happy to extend you that courtesy.
So what's it to be?
Blackjack, your father's favorite?
Let's keep it simple.
One card.
High draw.
A million dollars.
Wait.
Bury the top three cards.
You're determined to protect me.
From yourself. You don't have to do this.
There's no point in living if you can't feel alive.
Queen of hearts.
It appears you've been beaten...
...by the ace of clubs.
No hard feelings, my dear.
Come again soon.
Shall we?
This is a game I can't afford to play.
I know.
-What happened to Davidov?
-I gave him the night off.
Welcome to the Devil's Breath.
For thousands of years,
Hindu pilgrims journeyed to this holy place...
...to witness the wonder of
the natural flames that never die...
...and to test their devotion...
...to God...
...by holding the scalding rocks in their hands...
...as they said their prayers.
Tell me, Davidov...
...what happened this afternoon?
You promised me your best men.
Mr. Arkov supplied the latest weapons.
Yes, but Bond--
Bond was unarmed.
And you, Arkov?
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
I have the authorization and passes in the car.
I have arranged for a plane tonight, but....
But what?
We should scrub the rest of the mission.
The Parahawks were meant to be returned.
People will ask questions, even of me.
All because of his incompetence.
I see.
I see you're right.
He should be punished.
Davidov, hold this for me.
It was wrong of me
to expect so much of you.
Kill him.
He failed his test of devotion.
You can take his place.
Take his I.D.
And do be on time.
Poor shoulder.
It looks painful.
It needs constant attention.
I knew....
I knew when I first saw you.
I knew it would be like this.
Enough ice for one day.
How did you survive?
I seduced the guards.
Used my body.
It gave me control.
And the rest,
I got a gun and started shooting.
And what about you?
What do you do to survive?
I take pleasure...
...in great beauty.
Let's go. It's getting late.
What happened to Davidov?
I was told to expect him.
He was buried with work.
Let's go. Get your stuff.
Okay, come on.
Let's get out of here.
You're late.
Did you bring it?
The grease.
Of course.
Excellent.
Get ready. We're 10 minutes out.
But make sure you wear the I.D.
I'm gonna go get some air.
Welcome to Kazakhstan, Dr. Arkov.
I'm a great admirer of your research.
It's not often we see
someone of your stature here.
I go where the work takes me.
By the way,
you have the transport documents?
I pulled the plutonium
out of the one inside.
You can detonate the triggers now.
Look, our IDA physicist.
Don't bother. Not interested in men.
Take my word for it.
This year we decommissioned
four test sites. Not even a glimmer.
Are you here for a reason?
Or are you just hoping for a glimmer?
And you are...?
Mikhail Arkov.
Russian Atomic Energy Department.
Miss...?
Doctor...
...Jones. Christmas Jones.
And don't make any jokes.
I've heard them all.
I don't know any doctor jokes.
This is okay.
Take the elevator down the hole.
Your friends are already down there.
Don't I get some protection?
No, Dr. Arkov.
Down there it's weapons-grade plutonium.
Reasonably safe.
Up here we have leaking hydrogen bombs
that your lab built...
...which I've spent the last six months cleaning up.
So if you need any protection at all,
it's from me.
Your friends are waiting for you.
Doctor.
Aren't you forgetting?
Of course. Thank you.
By the way....
Expecting Davidov?
He caught a bullet instead of the plane.
Get off.
Keep your mouth shut.
You can't kill me. I'm already dead.
Not dead enough for me.
Show a little gratitude.
I did spare your life at the banker's office.
That's right.
I couldn't kill you.
You were working for me.
You delivered the money, killed King.
Now you brought me the plane.
What's your plan for the bomb?
You first.
Or could it be you don't have a plan?
That bomb will never leave this room.
Neither will you.
How sad to be threatened by a man...
...who can't grasp what he's involved in.
Revenge is not hard to fathom
for a man who believes in nothing.
And what do you believe in?
Preservation of capital?
Go ahead, shoot me.
I welcome it.
My men will hear the shot and kill you.
And the firefight will bring down
half the army from above.
But when a certain phone call
isn't made in 20 minutes...
...Elektra dies.
You're bluffing.
She's beautiful, isn't she?
You should have had her before...
...when she was innocent.
How does it feel...
...to know I broke her in for you?
I usually hate killing an unarmed man.
Cold-blooded murder is a filthy business.
A man tires of being executed.
But in your case, I feel nothing...
...just like you.
But then again, there's no point living
if you can't feel alive.
-Drop the gun!
-Keep away, colonel.
He's an impostor.
Dr. Arkov is 63 years old.
This is your impostor.
Along with the men outside on the plane.
They'll steal the bomb.
I said drop it!
On your knees!
Well done.
He would've killed us all.
Did you speak to him?
Yeah, but he's no atomic scientist.
I suppose you were the one
who allowed him down.
You had me...
...but I knew you couldn't...
...shoulder the responsibility.
Without any interruptions, let's proceed.
Too many new faces are here,
including yours.
The bomb doesn't move
until I am satisfied.
All of you, to the surface, now.
Come on! Go!
Move!
They're sealing us in.
Who are you?
I work for the British government.
Stay calm.
No hard feelings, Mr. Bond...
...but we're even.
Soon...
...you'll feel nothing at all.
Seal the door! Close it!
Come on!
Keep going! Move! Hang on!
You're a British spy.
Do you have a name?
The name's Bond.
James Bond.
Don't stop! Go, go! Jump!
They won't get very far.
Every warhead has a locator card.
We can track the signal.
You mean one of these?
Do we have the range of Renard's plane?
Anywhere in this circle: Russia...
...Armenia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan--
Sorry to interrupt.
Elektra is calling from Baku.
It's on the video line.
Put her on the wall screen.
I'm sorry.
I would never call you except...
...James has disappeared.
He left my villa in the middle of the night...
...and my head of security has been found...
...near a local airstrip, murdered.
I'll send someone out.
M, could you come?
I can't help thinking...
...I'm next.
Get me out there.
Just get me out there.
Gabor?
Surprised?
What's wrong with you?
Are you crazy?
Maybe.
Maybe I should ask you.
After all...
...''There's no point in living
if you can't feel alive.''
Isn't that right, Elektra?
Isn't that your motto?
What do you mean?
Or did you steal it
from your old friend Renard?
He and I had a chat.
Knew all about us. Knew about my shoulder.
Knew exactly where to hurt me.
Renard's the man who's trying to kill me?
Drop the act.
It's over.
I don't know what you mean.
Oh, I think you do.
It's called Stockholm syndrome.
Common in kidnappings.
Young, impressionable victim.
Sheltered.
Sexually inexperienced.
A powerful kidnapper skilled
in torture, manipulation.
Something snaps in the victim's mind.
The captive falls in love with her captor.
How dare you?
How dare you?
That animal. That monster?
He disgusts me.
You disgust me.
So he knew where to hurt you,
is that it?
You had a sling on your arm at the funeral.
And I didn't have to
sleep with you to find that out.
He used your exact words.
So you knew.
You knew all the time
he was out there, coming for me...
...and you lied.
You used me.
You used me as bait.
And you made love to me.
What?
To pass the time
as you waited for him to strike?
He's struck again.
Ten men are dead at the pipeline.
I'm coming with you.
You do what you want to do,
but I've called M.
She's coming to take charge.
I want an update.
Where do we stand?
One of Renard's men took
the locator card from the bomb...
...so we can't track it. But....
But what?
With all due respect...
...I don't think you should be here.
May I remind you that
you're the reason I'm here, 007.
You disobeyed an order
and left that girl alone.
Perhaps that girl isn't as innocent as you think.
-What are you saying?
-Suppose the inside man...
...the one who switched King's lapel pin...
...turned out to be an inside woman?
She kills her father
and attacks her own pipeline?
-Why? To what end?
-I don't know...yet.
Look at that.
That's not right.
What is it?
An observation rig.
Travels in the pipe looking for cracks.
Shut it down.
I don't understand.
It won't respond.
The place is clean. No sign of--
-The bomb is in the pipeline.
-Oh, my God!
They brought it through here.
That'd explain the attack.
Heading for the oil terminal.
Where it would do the most damage.
Have your men evacuate that terminal.
So now do you believe me?
This is an emergency situation.
So please...
...clear the room. Do it.
He's going for the oil.
The one pipeline the West is
counting on to supply our reserves.
Do you have an idea?
Maybe.
How far is the rig from the terminal?
How fast is it traveling?
It's 106 miles from the terminal,
going 70 miles an hour.
We have 78 minutes.
Is there another rig?
There's one parked
in the passageway ahead of it.
-Charles, can you get me out there?
-Of course.
Wait a minute. Are you gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?
-What do I need to defuse a bomb?
-Me.
There it is.
Hatch to the passageway.
You keep the speed up
so the other rig catches up with us.
-I'll wait to hear from you.
-Gotcha.
You know how to drive this thing?
Doesn't exactly take a degree
in nuclear physics.
They're in the pipeline.
They're on the move.
Faster!
If there's the slightest chance,
Bond will succeed.
He's the best we have...
...though I'd never tell him.
I hope you're right.
Here it comes!
It's closing up. Faster!
Sit tight.
No brakes! The controls are jammed!
It's a tactical fission device.
Low yield. Hold me steady.
You've defused hundreds of these, right?
Yeah, but they're usually standing still.
Life's full of small challenges.
Have a look at this.
Someone stripped the screw heads.
Someone's tampered with the bomb.
Look, half the plutonium's missing.
So what are you saying?
It couldn't go nuclear?
There's still enough explosive
to kill us both if the trigger goes off.
-Let it blow.
-But I can stop it.
Let it blow!
Trust me. Leave it.
Move down. Move down!
Jump! Go on, jump!
Jump!
Robinson's reporting.
The bomb was a dud.
But the triggering charge blew out
a 50-yard section of the pipe.
And Bond?
Nothing.
I'm so sorry.
But I have a gift for you.
Something that belonged to my father.
He would've wanted you to have it.
Perhaps this isn't the time.
Please.
He often spoke of how compassionately...
...you advised him on the best course
of action during my kidnapping.
It's very valuable, you know.
I couldn't let it explode
with the rest of him.
I was very upset
when the money didn't kill both of you.
I didn't think I'd get another chance.
Then you dropped the answer right in my lap.
Bond.
And as you say,
he's the best you have.
Or should I say, ''had''?
Take her to the helicopter.
Come on, give me your hand.
Jump, jump!
Do you wanna explain why you did that?
I could've stopped it.
You almost killed us.
I did kill us.
She thinks we're dead,
and she thinks she got away with it.
Do you wanna put that in English
for those of us who don't speak ''spy''?
Who's ''she''?
Elektra King.
Why would she blow up her own pipeline?
It makes her look innocent.
The explosion covers up
the theft of the plutonium.
It looks like a terrorist attack.
But why leave this half?
So there's enough to spread around
to cover up what they did take.
What will they do with the other half?
It's not enough to make a nuclear bomb.
-You're the scientist, you tell me.
-I don't know.
But the world's greatest terrorist
running around with 6 kilos...
...of plutonium can't be good.
I have to get it back,
or somebody will have my ass.
First things first.
Bond to Robinson. Do you copy?
By the way, before we go any further...
...I just wanna know....
What's the story with you and Elektra?
We're strictly platonic. Now.
Bond to Robinson. Copy?
What's your story?
What are you doing here in Kazakhstan?
Avoiding those kind of questions,
just like you.
I read you, 007. Red alert.
M is missing with Elektra.
Three men down.
Await instructions. Out.
What do we do now?
I may have overlooked one critical element.
What? More plutonium?
Beluga.
Caviar.
Brought me something?
The power to reshape the world.
Go on.
It's safe.
Touch your destiny.
I have brought something for you as well.
Your present.
Courtesy of the late Mr. Bond.
My executioner.
Overpraise, I'm afraid.
-But my people will finish the job.
-Your people?
Your people will leave you here to rot...
...just like you left me.
You and my father.
-Your father--
-My father was nothing.
His kingdom he stole from my mother.
The kingdom I will rightly take back.
I hope you're proud
of what you did to her.
I'm afraid it is you who deserve credit.
When I took her...
...she was promise itself.
You left her at the mercy of a man like me.
You ruined her.
For what?
To get to me?
She's worth 50 of me.
For once, I agree with you.
And now we also share a common fate.
You will die...
...along with everyone in this city...
...and the bright, starry,
oil-driven future of the West.
Since you sent your man to kill me...
...I've been watching time tick slowly away...
...marching toward my own death.
Now you can have the same pleasure.
Watch these hands, M.
By noon tomorrow...
...your time is up.
And I guarantee you...
...I will not miss.
So beautiful.
So smooth.
So warm.
How would you know?
Why are you like this?
Because Bond is dead?
It's what you wanted.
Of course it's what I wanted.
He was....
He was a good lover?
What do you think?
I wouldn't feel anything?
I feel nothing.
What about this?
But surely...
...you can feel this?
Remember...
...pleasure?
Wait here.
Always something.
First the casino.
Now the caviar factory.
I am a slave to the free-market economy.
Bond is alive.
Is nothing in this place straight?
Who are you?
And how did you get in?
I'll call security...
...and congratulate them.
Drink?
Can't you say hello like a normal person?
Get lost.
No, no, no. Down the back.
What's your business with Elektra King?
I thought you were the one
giving her the business.
She drops $1 million in your casino,
and you don't even blink an eye.
What's she paying you off for?
You know, if I were you,
a relationship with a man like that...
...I wouldn't bet on it.
$5000 of beluga. Ruined.
That's nothing compared to
what a nuclear bomb can do.
We had a nuclear bomb stolen this morning.
Renard and Elektra King
are working together.
-I didn't know.
-Well, what do you know?
Q's not gonna like this.
Get out!
Help!
Now...
...where were we?
-A rope, please!
-No. The truth.
She has M.
-I know nothing.
-Those blades were meant for you.
What does Elektra King want you dead for?
It was you who destroyed my factory.
Then you drown my Rolls-Royce...
...and now you're trying
to drown me in my own caviar!
Let me out!
Too bad we don't have any... champagne.
Or sour cream.
Occasionally...
...I get equipment for her.
Machinery. Russian stuff.
And the payoff in the casino?
It was a special job.
My nephew is in the navy.
He's smuggling some machinery for her.
-Where?
-Absolutely not!
Where?
-Where?
-Istanbul!
You!
Where have you been,
you gold-encrusted buffoon?
Sorry, boss.
I must have bumped my head.
Get me out of here,
I'll show you what a bumped head feels like.
Look.
We have no roof,
but at least we have four good walls.
The insurance company
is never going to believe this.
This used to be the KGB's
Istanbul safe house. Now it's FSB.
Federal Security Bureau.
Same old friendly service with a new name.
-Did you raise Nikolai?
-Nothing.
Try scanning the emergency frequencies.
Tragedy.
In the old days, there were 100 places...
...where a submarine could surface undetected.
Submarine?
What class is your nephew running?
Victor 3, you call it.
Nuclear. He's not loading cargo.
They want the sub to use the reactor.
That's it.
Put weapons-grade plutonium
in that sub's reactor...
...instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Making it all look just like an accident.
But why?
Because the existing pipelines
from the Caspian Sea...
...go to the north. Here.
The oil is put on the tankers,
shipped across the Black Sea to Istanbul.
The explosion would destroy Istanbul...
...contaminating the Bosporus for decades.
There'd be one way to get the oil out.
Down south to the Med.
The King pipeline.
Elektra's pipeline.
We must find Nikolai.
Captain Nikolai?
Sir.
Ready to load your cargo.
-We have only a few hours.
-You came with skeleton crew?
-That's all we can afford.
-Of course.
Some brandy and
refreshments for your men.
Thank you.
Good morning.
What's the time?
It's time for you to die.
I've got something.
On the emergency frequency.
Two six-digit numbers
cycled every 15 seconds.
A GPS signal. Position coordinates.
Locator card. M.
-Here.
-Maiden's Tower.
Have you been there?
No.
Mr. Bullion!
Bomb!
Come on, come on.
After you.
I insist.
Enjoyed your meal, boys?
Take them up and throw them in the sea.
The extruder's in here.
It'll take me half an hour to set up
the machine to make the plutonium rod.
Put them in here.
The reactor is secured.
Everything is complete as planned.
-Is your helicopter ready?
-It'll pick me up in half an hour.
Then this is the end.
This is the beginning.
The world will never be the same.
The future is yours.
Have fun with it.
James Bond.
If only you'd kept away...
...we might've met again in a few years
and become lovers once more.
Take her to Renard.
Pretty thing.
You had her too?
I could've given you the world.
The world is not enough.
Foolish sentiment.
Family motto.
They were digging near here,
and they found some very pretty vases.
They also found this chair.
I think we ignore the old ways at our peril...
...don't you?
Where's M?
Soon she'll be everywhere.
All this...
...because you fell for Renard?
Five more turns and your neck will break.
I've always had a power over men.
When I realized my father wouldn't
rescue me from the kidnappers...
...I knew I had to form another alliance.
You...
...turned Renard.
Just like you...
...only you were even easier.
I told him he had to hurt me.
He had to make it look real.
When he refused...
...I told him I would do it myself.
So you killed your father.
He killed me.
He killed me the day
he refused to pay my ransom.
Was this all about the oil?
It is my oil.
Mine...
...and my family's.
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood.
I'm going to redraw the map.
And when I'm through,
the whole world will know my name...
...my grandfather's name,
the glory of my people!
No one will believe
this meltdown was an accident.
They will all believe.
You understand?
Nobody can resist me.
You know what happens
when a man is strangled?
Elektra... it's not too late.
Eight million people need not die.
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.
But you couldn't. Not me.
Not a woman you've loved.
You meant nothing to me.
One...
...last...
...screw.
Boss...
...you're alive.
So glad to see you.
Me too.
I'm looking for a sub.
It's big and black,
and the driver is a good friend of mine.
Bring it to me.
What a shame.
He's just gone.
Zukovsky really hated you.
Everything's under control up here.
Are you ready?
Time to say good night.
You can't kill me.
Not in cold blood.
Bond!
Call him off.
I won't ask again.
Call him off.
Call him off!
Renard.
You wouldn't kill me.
You'd miss me.
Dive! Bond--
I never miss.
Where is she?
Ah, James!
Thought I'd forgotten you, eh?
Level at 100 feet.
Hold her steady.
Level at 100 feet.
If we can force them up to the surface...
...they'll show up on the spy satellite...
...bring out the navy.
Come on. Get up!
Over there. Move!
Move! Go, go!
Get over there!
Stay!
Up!
Get us level! Level!
It's all smashed!
Christmas?
So we're going up then?
Slight miscalculation.
Hold on!
Hold on, hold on.
Brace yourself.
It's flooding!
Get up to the hatch.
Damn! Come on!
Go, go!
He's opened up the reactor!
And locked himself in!
I have to get up there to him.
We have one chance.
I'll get out and back in
through the reactor room escape hatch.
When the light goes red,
press this button so I can get back in.
James, it's too risky.
If I don't make it...
...use this chamber to get out.
Close the hatch.
Exhale all the way up. Close it.
Help!
Come on, come on!
We're safe from the radiation...
...if the reactor coolant doesn't burst.
If he had gotten
the plutonium rod in the reactor...
...we could've written off the whole city.
Welcome to my nuclear family.
Are you really gonna
commit suicide for her?
You forget, I'm already dead.
Haven't you heard?
So is she.
You're lying.
Liar!
Liar!
She's waiting for you.
The hydrogen gas level's too high.
One spark and the reactor'll blow.
I have to stop it.
Go to the top of the sub.
Meet me in the torpedo bay.
The reactor is flooded.
So it's safe even if this place blows.
No, it's simply not the case.
No. Before that.
Any word?
No. Still no contact.
Always wanted
to have Christmas in Turkey.
Was that a Christmas joke?
From me?
No.
Never.
So isn't it time
you unwrap your present?
Oh, I think so.
Look. What's that?
-The card.
-He must be nearby.
Where?
-Where?
-It picks up...
...body heat,
so humans come out orange.
There.
I thought you said
he was with Dr. Jones?
It's getting redder.
Must be a premature form
of the millennium bug.
I was wrong about you.
Yeah?
How so?
I thought Christmas only comes once a year.
PUKCH`ONG COAST, NORTH KOREA
Look, what is this? I`m supposed to...
Colonel Tan-Sun Moon`s HQ
De-Militarised Zone, North Korea
Open the bag.
That will teach you to lecture me.
Retract the blast doors.
Find me a new anger therapist.
I am Zao.
You are late.
Mr Van Bierk. l`ve been
looking forward to this meeting.
Me, too.
My African military friends
owe you many thanks, Colonel Moon.
Few men have the guts to trade
conflict diamonds since the UN embargo.
I know all about the UN.
I studied at Oxford and Harvard.
Majored in Western hypocrisy.
From your modest little collection of cars,
I would never have guessed.
- Show me the diamonds.
- Show me the weapons.
Bring the weapons.
Hiding weapons in the demilitarised zone.
It`s a bit of a minefield out there.
America`s cultural contribution.
One million land mines,
and my hovercrafts float right over them.
RPGs, flamethrowers, automatic weapons
and enough ammunition
to run a small war.
My diamonds?
Check it over quick.
- Don`t blow it all at once.
- I`ve special plans for this consignment.
His name is James Bond.
A British assassin.
Mr Van Bierk,
let me show you something.
Our new tank buster.
- Depleted uranium shells, naturally.
- Naturally.
And how do you propose to kill me now...
Mr Bond?
It`s pathetic that you British still believe
you have the right to police the world.
But you will not live to see the day
all Korea is ruled by the North.
Then you and I
have something in common.
Who is it?
Where`s my son?
It`s the General.
Hello, Father.
Why is there a fire?
I`ll be there in five minutes.
Get the weapons out of here...
and kill the spy.
Saved by the bell.
My son is dead.
I don`t condone what they do here.
Tell it to the concierge.
Still you jest.
Defiant to the last.
Your people have abandoned you.
Your very existence denied.
Why stay silent?
It doesn`t matter any more.
Things are out of my hands.
We reach the end, Mr Bond.
Spare me the unpleasantries.
carved Korea in two.
And then you arrive.
A British spy. An assassin.
And now the hardliners have their proof
we cannot trust the West.
You...
You took away my son.
Your firing squad
should have done the job for me.
I hoped a Western education would help
him become a bridge between our worlds.
But all it did was to corrupt him.
Let`s get this over with, shall we?
My son had an ally in the West.
For the last time, who was it?
Who made him betray
his country and his name?
The same person who betrayed me.
Turn around!
Start walking.
Keep walking, please.
Keep moving.
Zao!
I`m being traded.
- For you.
- Keep moving. Keep walking, please.
Your time will come.
Not as soon as yours.
Keep walking, please.
Look at him.
You`d think he was some kind of a hero.
OK, hold him tight.
- Watch his legs now.
- All right, let`s go.
No biological agents
in the prelim scan. He`s clean.
Pulse 72.
Blood pressure 120 over 80.
Indications of neurotoxins, histamine,
serotonin, enzyme inhibitors.
Scorpion venom.
Also traces of a venom antiserum.
They`d sting him,
then administer the antidote.
Yet his internal organs seem unaffected.
Liver not too good.
It`s definitely him, then.
Morning.
Welcome back.
Such hospitality.
You don`t seem too pleased to see me.
If I`d had my way,
you`d still be in North Korea.
Your freedom came at too high a price.
Zao.
He tried to blow up a summit
between South Korea and China.
Took out three Chinese agents
before he was caught.
And now he`s free.
I never asked to be traded.
- I`d rather die in prison than let him loose.
- You had your cyanide.
Threw it away years ago.
What the hell is this about?
The top US agent in the North Korean
High Command was executed last week.
The Americans intercepted a signal
from your prison naming him.
- And they think it`s me?
- You were the only inmate.
They concluded you cracked
and were haemorrhaging information.
We had to get you out.
And what do you think?
With drugs, you wouldn`t know
what you did or didn`t say.
I know the rules.
And number one is no deals.
Get caught and you`re given up.
The mission was compromised.
Moon got a call exposing me.
He had a partner in the West.
Even his father knew about it.
- Whether that`s true or not, it`s irrelevant.
- No, it isn`t.
The same person who set me up then
has just set me up again to get Zao out.
So I`m going after him.
The only place you`re going
is our evaluation centre in the Falklands.
- Double-O status rescinded.
- Along with my freedom?
For as long as I deem necessary, yes.
You`re no use to anyone now.
- He`s gone into cardiac arrest.
- Crash trolley. Notify his superiors. Now!
He`s flatlining on the ECG.
Get me some atropine. We`re losing him!
Stand by. Clear.
I`m checkin` out.
Thanks for the kiss of life.
Security breach on level three.

Security breach on level three.
All personnel defensive, code red.
Apprehend and detain with force.
Security breach on level three.
All personnel defensive, code red.
My usual suite, please.
Do you have a credit card?
Or even any luggage, sir?
Mr Bond, so good to see you.
It`s been a long time.
Mr Chang.
Open the Presidential Suite.
Could you send up my tailor
and some food?
The lobster`s good,
with quails` eggs and sliced seaweed.
- And if there`s any left, a `61 Bollinger.
- Of course.
Do it quickly.
Been busy, have we, Mr Bond?
Just surviving, Mr Chang.
Just surviving.
I am Peaceful Fountains of Desire.
The masseuse.
I come with compliments of the manager.
I`m sure you do. Come in.
On the bed, please. Face down.
Yes, of course.
I`m not that kind of masseuse.
I`m not that kind of customer.
You think I haven`t always known
you`re Chinese Intelligence, Chang?
- Hong Kong`s our turf now, Bond.
- Don`t worry. I`m not here to take it back.
Put your hands down.
What the hell do you want?
Just to help you settle a score.
Zao killed three of your men.
You get me into North Korea,
I`ll take care of him for you.
What`s in it for you?
Chance to get even.
Zao has information I need.
- I`ll have to ask Beijing.
- Do it.
Now get out. Unless you
really want to give me a massage.
Ah, Mr Bond.
A little ``thank you`` from us.
- Cuba?
- It seems Mr Zao`s lost himself in Havana.
If you find him, say goodbye from us.
With pleasure.
HAVANA
- S?
- I`m here to pick up Delectados.
Delectados? We haven`t
made Delectados in 30 years.
I`m from Universal Exports.
Check with your boss.
Follow me.
Your passport, seor.
I`d come to think the Delectados
would never be smoked.
They are particularly hazardous
for one`s health, Mr...
Bond.
Mr Bond.
- D`you know why?
- It`s the addition of the Volado tobacco.
Slow-burning.
It never goes out.
- Just like a sleeper.
- Sorry for the rude awakening.
I love my country, Mr Bond.
I`d never ask you to betray your people.
I`m after a North Korean.
- A tourist?
- A terrorist.
One man`s terrorist
is another man`s freedom fighter.
Zao has no interest
in other people`s freedom.
I still have some friends in high places.
Favours called in.
Some dollars spread about.
We find your friend is here,
on an island in Los Organos.
There is a strange clinic
run by Doctor Alvarez.
He leads the field in gene therapy.
Increasing the life expectancy
of our beloved leaders.
And, of course, the richest Westerners.
We may have lost our freedom
in the revolution, but...
we have a health system second to none.
You don`t seem to have done
badly out of the revolution.
We all have our ways of getting by.
You`d be surprised how many
government officials come to me
for reminders of the decadent times.
Ah, yeah, well.
- Mind if I borrow these?
- Please.
My sources tell me this Zao is dangerous.
I wish I could give you more help.
I could use a fast car.
Mojito, por favor.
Mr Krug, your admittance papers
for the Alvarez Clinic tomorrow.
About bloody time, Fidel.
Now round up some more girls
and take them to room 42.
Unless you want to be
known as Fidel Castrato.
Magnificent view.
It is, isn`t it?
Too bad it`s lost on everybody else.
Mojito?
You should try it.
Giacinta Johnson.
My friends call me Jinx.
My friends call me James Bond.
Jinx, you say.
Born on Friday the 13th.
Do you believe in bad luck?
Let`s just say
my relationships don`t seem to last.
I know the feeling.
Predators usually appear at sunset.
- And why is that?
- It`s when their prey comes out to drink.
Too strong for you?
I could learn to like it, if I had the time.
How much time have you got?
- Until dawn. What about you?
- Oh, I`m just here for the birds.
Ornithologist.
Ornithologist, huh?
Wow. Now there`s a mouthful.
So you`re gonna be busy tonight
with the owls then, huh?
No owls in Los Organos.
Nothing to see till the morning.
Not out there, anyway.
So what do predators do...
when the sun goes down?
They feast...
like there`s no tomorrow.
Are you always this frisky?
I`ve been missing the touch
of a good woman.
Who says I`m good?
What the hell do you want?
I don`t need a wheelchair.
No?
You do now.
- Buenos das!
- Hola!
Seor.
- OK.
- Gracias.
Isla Los Organos
Buenos das!
So you are to have
DNA replacement therapy.
Let me explain the two phases.
First, we kill off your bone marrow,
wipe the DNA slate clean.
Phase two: introduction of new DNA
harvested from healthy donors -
orphans, runaways,
people that won`t be missed.
I like to think of myself as an artist.
And this is when I create.
Thank you.
It is a painful process, I`m afraid.
But... all great art is.
I`ll certainly enjoy working on you.
Of course, you know,
most artists are only truly appreciated
after they`re dead.
My father was a sergeant.
We lived in Hampshire.
I have fond memories of the countryside.
Oh, good.
Got your attention.
Who`s bankrolling
your makeover, Zao? Hm?
Same person who
set me up in North Korea?
James? What`s goin` on?
Jinx, you`ve gotta get out of here now!
Move! Move!
Vamos! Vamos!
Vamos!
Move it! Move it! Let`s go!
See, my friend, the chemical composition
shows this is from Sierra Leone.
- Conflict diamonds.
- Yeah.
There`s some kind of marking here.
- ``GG.``
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
From the Graves Corporation in Iceland.
That`s his laser signature.
A man called Gustav Graves discovered
diamonds there a year or so ago.
Yet they`re identical to conflict diamonds.
What an amazing coincidence.
How can he escape from a British warship
in Hong Kong right under your nose?
- Interesting station, Moneypenny?
- All I got was a storm warning.
You were supposed to throw away
the key, not leave the door wide open.
Are you implying I had a hand
in his escape, Mr Falco?
Well, Bond got away real fast, didn`t he?
It is what he`s trained to do.
Your boy`s been busy in his training. He
showed up in Cuba and torches a clinic.
Listen, you put your house in order,
or we`re gonna do it for you.
Your drink, sir.
Lucky I asked for it shaken.
- When`s he coming?
- I don`t know.
- Looks like your man won`t make it.
- Actually, he`s right on time.
- Wonderful day to become a knight.
- Will you use your title, Mr Graves?
I`m proud of my adopted nation,
but I`d never stand on ceremony.
After that entrance,
you can`t be surprised to be called
- a self-publicising, adrenaline junkie.
- I prefer the term ``adventurer``.
There are rumours about the Icarus
space programme. What`s the secret?
It`s not a secret, it`s a surprise.
You`ll soon be enlightened.
You seem to work 24-seven.
Is it true you don`t need sleep?
You only get one shot at life.
Why waste it on sleep?
Are you trying out for the British Olympic
fencing team? You`ve trained furiously.
I never get furious. As they say in fencing,
``What`s the point?``
Thank you very much. We don`t want
to keep Her Majesty waiting any longer.
- Mr Graves?
- Mr Graves?
Hit.
That`s a hit.
Verity?
James Bond.
Your lesson.
I see you handle your weapon well.
I have been known to keep my tip up.
Do you mind? I think I`ve come undone.
Why not?
Hit. Positions.
Play.
Feast your eyes on the club`s finest blade.
- Gustav Graves?
- His publicist, Miranda Frost.
Et l!
My protge.
Gorgeous, isn`t she?
She took the gold at Sydney.
- By default, if I remember.
- Default?
The one who beat her OD`d on steroids.
Miranda deserved that gold.
Now she`s teaching Graves
how to win one.
He only plays for cash.
He`s won so much,
nobody else wants to fight him.
You wanna meet him?
Absolutely.
Lead on.
- Gustav.
- Verity.
- And Mr...?
- Bond.
James Bond.
Have we met before?
Oh, I think I`d remember.
Of course you would. My mistake.
- Are you a gambling man, Mr Bond?
- If the stakes are right.
L1 ,000 a point too much for you?
Care to place a bet, Verity?
No, thanks.
I don`t like cockfights.
Shall we?
Excuse me.
Best of three hits?
Positions.
Ready. Play.
En garde.
Hit. Positions.
Play.
Et l!
Hit.
- D`you want to continue?
- D`you want to up the wager?
How much can you afford?
Let`s play for this.
I picked it up in Cuba.
I believe it`s one of yours.
My, my.
They do get around.
But, then, diamonds are for everyone.
Brilliant specimen. Completely flawless.
And chemically identical
to African conflict diamonds.
Then you`re about to lose
something very precious.
Positions.
Ready. Play.
En garde.
Oh, dear.
You want to continue?
Of course I want to bloody continue!
But since we`re upping the wager,
let`s up the weapons, shall we?
Yeah.
Let`s do this the old-fashioned way.
First blood drawn from the torso.
Steady on!
That is enough!
It`s just a little sport, Miranda.
It seems you beat me, Mr Bond.
Settle downstairs, shall we?
Miranda.
You`re a rare challenge, Mr Bond.
I`m putting on a scientific demonstration
in Iceland at the weekend. Icarus?
Join us. Miranda, make the arrangements.
Once I`ve smoothed
things over with the club.
What would I do without you?
Can I expect the pleasure of you
in Iceland?
You`ll never have that pleasure, Mr Bond.
Excuse me, Commander Bond.
Someone left this for you.
Place needed redecorating anyway.
I heard of this place.
Never thought I`d find myself here.
Some things are best kept underground.
An abandoned station
for abandoned agents.
- Your calling card.
- So what have you got on Graves?
You burn me.
- And now you want my help.
- What did you expect, an apology?
Oh, I know you`ll do
whatever it takes to get the job done.
- Just like you.
- The difference is I won`t compromise.
Well, I don`t have the luxury
of seeing things as black and white.
- While you were gone the world changed.
- Not for me.
You`re suspicious of Graves,
or I wouldn`t be here right now.
- So, what do you have?
- Nothing beyond the official biography.
Orphan working in an Argentinian
diamond mine learns engineering.
Makes a huge find in Iceland
and gives half of it to charity.
From nothing to everything
in no time at all.
- And his demonstration this weekend?
- Probably just another publicity stunt.
Now, tell me what you know
about this Cuban clinic.
Gene therapy. New identities
courtesy of DNA transplants.
So-called ``beauty parlour``.
We`d heard rumours of such a place.
I didn`t think it really existed.
It doesn`t any more.
Zao got away.
But he left these behind.
All from Gustav Graves`s mine.
I think it`s a front for laundering
African conflict diamonds.
We need to tread carefully.
Graves is politically connected.
- Lucky I`m on the outside, then.
- It seems you`ve become useful again.
Then maybe it`s time
you let me get on with my job.
Forgive my mentioning it, 007,
but a perfect marksman isn`t really
supposed to shoot his own boss.
Check the replay.
You`ll find he`s dead
and she`s only got a flesh wound.
There`s always an excuse,
isn`t there, Double-O Zero?
Give me the old firing range any day,
Quartermaster.
Yes, but it`s called the future,
so get used to it.
So, this is where they keep
the old relics then, eh?
I`ll have you know this is where our most
cutting-edge technology is developed.
- Point taken.
- Must you touch everything?
Does this still work?
- Now, look...
- So where is this cutting-edge stuff?
I`m trying to get to it.
Weapon, please.
One pane unbreakable glass,
one standard-issue ring finger.
Twist so, et voil.
Ultra high-frequency,
single-digit, sonic agitator unit.
You`re cleverer than you look.
Better than looking cleverer than you are.
Follow me, please.
- Now, a new watch. Your 20th, I believe.
- How time flies.
Yes, well, 007, why don`t you establish
a record by actually returning this one?
Your new transportation.
You`ve been down here too long.
- The ultimate in British engineering.
- You must be joking.
As I learnt from my predecessor, Bond,
I never joke about my work.
Aston Martin call it the Vanquish.
We call it the Vanish.
- Oh, very good.
- Adaptive camouflage.
Tiny cameras on all sides
project the image they see
onto a light-emitting polymer skin
on the opposite side.
To the casual eye,
it`s as good as invisible.
Plus the usual refinements:
ejector seat, torpedoes,
target-seeking shotguns
to shoot down mobile objects.
Acquaint yourself with the manual. Should
be able to shoot through it in two hours.
Just took a few seconds, Q.
Wish I could make you vanish.
Come in.
Before you leave
on your mission for Iceland,
tell me what you know of James Bond.
He`s a double-O.
And a wild one, as I discovered today.
He`ll light fuses on any explosive situation
and be a danger to himself and others.
Kill first, ask questions later.
He`s a blunt instrument whose primary
method is to provoke and confront.
A man nobody can get close to.
A womaniser.
Well, you`re going to be seeing
a lot more of him in Iceland.
With great respect,
a man like him could blow my cover.
Miss Frost, you volunteered for this, but
in three months you`ve turned up nothing.
Graves seems to be clean.
Well, Bond thinks differently, so I`m going
to let him do what you so ably described -
mix things up a little with Mr Graves.
And with you there,
things won`t be able to get out of hand.
In your three years in Cryptology, you`ve
kept business and pleasure separate.
You haven`t fraternised
with any of your fellow agents,
despite several advances.
I think it would be foolish to get involved
with someone within the community.
Especially James Bond.
I`m Mr Kil.
Well, there`s a name to die for.
That`s a new personal best, boss.
Thruster two cut out again.
Get it fixed, will you?
Glad you could make it, Mr Bond.
How did you like my run?
You looked on the edge of losing control.
It`s only by being on the edge that we
know who we really are. Under the skin.
Take your Donald Campbell -
- Campbell died on his return run.
- Yeah, but he died chasing a dream.
- Isn`t that the way to go?
- I`d rather not go at all.
- You don`t chase dreams, you live them.
- One of the virtues of never sleeping.
I have to live my dreams. Besides,
plenty of time to sleep when you`re dead.
Mr Bond.
- Ah, Miss Frost.
- I`ll show you your room.
A palace of ice.
You must feel right at home.
This place was built
for tonight`s demonstration.
The human element necessitates
a precise balance of heat and cold.
Built on a lake?
I hope Graves got things right.
- What`s that property I noticed next door?
- The diamond mine.
And Gustav`s quarters.
Thank you.
This is you.
Wonderful.
Would you like to show me more?
Vodka martini.
Plenty of ice, if you can spare it.
Mojito?
James.
Here for the penguins this time,
or for the view again?
Now I`m only interested
in endangered species.
- Oh, well, does that include me?
- Depends on what you`re up to this time.
So I left you in an explosive situation.
You`re a big boy who can handle himself.
- No wonder your relationships don`t last.
- I`m a girl who hates to get tied down.
You look terrible.
You aren`t looking too good yourself.
You are still feeling the side effects?
The insomnia is permanent for me.
An hour on the Dream Machine
keeps me sane.
- What happened to you?
- Bond.
He knows nothing. I`ve been this close
to him and he still didn`t know who I was.
- You saw my father after your exchange?
- Yes.
General Moon still mourns your death.
My death.
Mr Bond.
- And Miss...?
- Swift. Space and Technology magazine.
Really? I take it Mr Bond`s been
explaining his big-bang theory.
Oh, yeah, I think I got the thrust of it.
I see.
Well, the demonstration`s about to begin
in five minutes. So shall we?
Shall we?
Not Jinx any more?
Oh, I`ll always be a jinx to you.
As you know, I try to give the planet
something in return for what it`s given me.
Those little shards of heaven
known as diamonds.
Now, diamonds aren`t just expensive
stones. They are the stuff of dreams.
And the means to make dreams real.
Imagine being able to bring light and
warmth to the darkest parts of the world.
Imagine being able to grow crops
the year round, bringing an end to hunger.
Imagine a second sun,
shining like a diamond in the sky.
Let there be light.
I give you Icarus!
Icarus is unique. Its miraculous
silver skin will inhale the sun`s light
and breathe it gently
upon the earth`s surface.
You have no idea how much Icarus
is about to change your world.
And now let us brighten this night
with our inner radiance.
- Vlad, show me the modifications.
- Yeah.
Here is the self-defence mechanism
you asked me to build in.
Armed.
- And very dangerous.
- Oh, very.
M warned me this would happen.
Ah. That`s why you tried so hard
not to be interested in me.
Oh, God, you`re even worse
than your file says.
They don`t look too convinced.
Come on. Put your back into it, eh?
I know all about you, 007.
Sex for dinner, death for breakfast.
It won`t work with me.
- No?
- No.
- You`re getting good at this.
- Oh, stop it. Are we still being watched?
- Oh, they left ages ago.
- Oh, God, you`re impossible.
Come on, let`s get out of here.
You better stay here tonight.
Keep up the charade of being lovers.
All right.
I admire your restraint. You were here
a full two hours before anything blew up.
The way you`re going,
you`ll get us both killed.
James, tell me what really happened
in North Korea.
I was betrayed. That was all.
Occupational hazard.
This is crazy. You`re a double-O.
It`s only a number.
James.
Be careful.
Go back to your room.
I`ll come back for you.
Why do you want to kill me?
I thought it was the humane thing to do.
Who sent you?
Your mama. And she told me to tell you
she`s really disappointed in you.
I`ll let you in on a little secret.
This mine is fake.
But the lasers...
are real.
She won`t talk.
Let`s make it permanent.
I`ll use the laser.
Don`t leave a mess.
- Jinx.
- James! James! No, no, turn it off! Off!
Off!
James, I could use a little help here!
Switch if off!
Or I`m gonna be half the girl I used to be!
So, the girl who hates
to be tied down, huh?
- Are you gonna get me off this thing?
- What are you? CIA?
NSA. Hello? We`re on the same side.
- Doesn`t mean we`re after the same thing.
- Sure it does.
World peace, unconditional love, and
your little friend with the expensive acne.
- Zao?
- Yeah, Zao.
He`s back there with some
weird psychedelic light mask.
Probably brought it from the Cuban clinic.
He couldn`t have brought it.
It was already here.
It belongs to another Korean.
His boss.
- Kil can give us a hand to get out of here.
- I got a better idea.
- I`m going to get backup.
- Wait.
Go to Miranda first. She`s MI6.
Warn her to get out.
And what are you gonna do?
Unfinished business.
So you live to die another day...
Colonel.
At last. I was beginning
to think you`d never guess.
Was it painful?
- The gene therapy?
- You couldn`t possibly imagine.
Oh, good. I`m glad to hear that.
Oh, but there have been compensations.
Like watching you
flail around in your ignorance.
Granting you life day by day
just to see if you`d get wise. It`s been fun.
Well, the fun is about
to come to a dead end.
We only met briefly, you and I.
But you left a lasting impression.
When your intervention forced me
to present the world with a new face,
I chose to model
the disgusting Gustav Graves on you.
Oh, just in the details.
That unjustifiable swagger.
Your crass quips - a defence mechanism
concealing such inadequacy.
My defence mechanism is right here.
So... Miss Frost isn`t all she seems.
Looks can be deceptive.
Yes.
By the way, did you find out
who betrayed you in North Korea?
Only a matter of time.
You never thought of looking
inside your own organisation?
She was right under your nose.
It was so good of you
to bring your gun to bed with us.
Yes. Occupational hazard.
You see, I have a gift.
An instinct for sensing
people`s weaknesses.
Yours is women. Hers and mine
is winning whatever the cost.
So when I arranged for that fatal
overdose for the true victor at Sydney,
I won myself my very own MI6 agent,
using everything at my disposal -
her brains, her talent,
even her sex.
The coldest weapon of all.
Hello?
Miranda?
- There will be others after me, you know.
- You mean your American friend Jinx.
Soon to be the victim of a tragedy.
An ice palace can be
such a treacherous place.
Hand over the toys.
Oh, yeah.
You know, I`ve missed
your sparkling personality.
How`s that for a punch line?
Kill him.
I enjoyed last night, James.
But it really is death for breakfast.
Kill him quietly.
Kill him! Now!
- He got away.
- No matter.
The pleasure of the kill is in the chase.
Bring me the generals.
Gentlemen,
I promised you a demonstration.
Now you will see the true power of Icarus.
The Western spy runs, but he cannot hide.
Icarus will lock onto the heat signature
and concentrate the sun`s power.
Hey, boss, he beat your time.
Time to draw the line.
Global warming is a terrible thing.
Yeah, nice moves. Just like Bond.
He was pretty vigorous last night as well.
He did you?
I didn`t know he was that desperate.
He won`t come back for you. He just died
running, trying to save his own skin.
Yeah.
That`s pretty good tailoring.
I hope it doesn`t shrink when it gets wet.
Soon we will be victorious.
We`ve got one hour to wrap this up.
Let`s move.
Come on, Jinx. Where are you?
All units report. Now!
Warning. Adaptive camouflage failure.
Time to give the American her bath.
Adaptive camouflage restored.
Vlad, does the word ``ergonomics``
mean anything to you? Man? Machine?
This is still a suitcase.
Finish it, will you?
Come on. It`s warm in here. Come on.
The cold kept you alive, huh?
Must have kept you alive. Come on.
That`s it.
What took you so long?
Agent Johnson.
- James.
- Charles.
OK. Bring us up to speed on this.
Another division`s been mobilised
north of the DMZ.
- That`s 80,000 troops and counting.
- And another million in reserve.
Moon`s father won`t let it turn into a war.
Moon`s under arrest.
Hardliners staged a coup last night.
The fact remains you deliberately
misled me by implicating Bond.
- If you`d told us of your agent in Cuba...
- She`d be dead, betrayed by your mole.
We wouldn`t have had a mole
if you`d told us Miss Frost and Moon
were on the Harvard
fencing team together.
Knowing who to trust
is everything in this business.
Well, well. James Bond.
- Just in time for the fireworks.
- Let`s get down to business.
We`re at DEFCON 2.
And if the North goes South,
they`re gonna go south big time.
You don`t just stroll through
the world`s biggest minefield.
You need some kind of an edge. Icarus.
We`re taking care of that
with an ASAT launch in one hour.
- Where`s Graves?
- In the middle of a North Korean air base.
Right where we can`t touch him.
You can`t... but I can.
Look, we`re here in case things escalate,
not to make sure that they do.
No incursions into the North.
The president gave me a direct order.
And when did that ever stop you?
You make your own decision.
I`m sending in 007.
You think I`d leave this
in the hands of the British?
You go with him.
Approaching drop zone!
OK, let`s go!
- They`ve entered North Korean airspace.
- Relax, Robinson.
If our radar can`t see those switchblades,
the North Koreans sure as hell can`t.
Hey, boss, they launched against Icarus.
Leave it on automatic.
I hope nobody here is superstitious. That
is one big mirror we`re about to break.
My God.
Mobilise the South Korean troops.
And get me the president, now!
Still no news of Bond?
Vehicles.
Some big shots.
It`s him.
- 300 metres.
- Windage: one and a half.
We`ve gotta get on that plane.
You. Have my father brought down.
Father.
I regret our meeting
had to be like this.
You can`t tell it`s me?
I don`t know you.
You`ve always found it difficult
to accept me.
That made my exile easier to bear,
but I never forgot what you taught me.
``In war the victorious strategist
only seeks battle...
..after the victory has been won.``
You see, Father,
I remember my Art of War.
And this is what guarantees that victory.
My son...
What have you done to yourself?
Come, Father.
Watch the rising of your son.
The second that hits the 38th parallel,
we`ll hit them with everything we got.
That may not be enough.
Do you see, Father?
Icarus is clearing the minefield,
creating a highway for our troops.
If the Americans don`t run,
Icarus will destroy them.
Japan is a bug waiting to be squashed.
And the West will shake with fear.
- America will send nuclear warheads.
- Icarus will swat them from the sky.
You will destroy us.
You would kill your own son?
The son I knew died long ago.
Father, you disappoint me.
Caution. Caution.
Manual. Manual.
Up! Up!
Come on.
OK, guys.
OK.
I got it.
My, my. You get around.
Let`s see your gun.
Uh-uh. Left hand.
That`s it.
That`s it. Now drop it.
Looks like your friends have bailed.
Put it on autopilot.
Come on.
That`s it. Good girl.
Drowning you didn`t seem to work. I`ll
have to try something more to the point.
I can read your every move.
Read this.
Bitch!
Oh, look! Parachutes for the both of us.
Whoops. Not any more.
You see, Mr Bond,
you can`t kill my dreams.
But my dreams can kill you.
Time to face destiny.
Time to face gravity.
I think I broke her heart.
Looks like we`re going down together.
Not yet.
- Get the back open!
- OK!
Come on!
- Come on. Come on.
- I told you I was a jinx.
I should have warned you.
My relationships don`t last either.
- At least we`re gonna die rich.
- Huh?
Come on. Come on, come on.
Come on. Come on.
Now...
you said something about
going down together?
James.
Moneypenny.
Oh, James.
Moneypenny?
I was... just testing it out.
It`s rather hard, isn`t it?
Yes. Very.
Wait. Don`t pull it out.
I`m not finished with it yet.
See? It`s a perfect fit.
- Leave it in.
- Well, it`s gotta come out sooner or later.
No, leave it in, please.
A few more minutes.
We really have to get these back.
Still the good guys, huh?
I`m still not quite sure...
how good you are.
I am so good.
Especially when you`re bad.
I need to lay down.
M doesnt mind you earning
a little money on the side, Dryden.
Shed just prefer it
if it wasnt selling secrets.
If the theatrics
are supposed to scare me
you have the wrong man, Bond.
If M was so sure that I was bent
shed have sent a double-0.
Benefits of being section chief
Id know if anyone had been
promoted to double-0 status
wouldnt I?
-Your file shows no kills, and it takes
-Two.
Shame.
We barely got to know each other.
I know where you keep your gun.
I suppose thats something.
True.
How did he die?
Your contact?
Not well.
Made you feel it, did he?
Well
you neednt worry.
The second is
Yes.
Considerably.
So how do I trust this man
that Ive never met with my money?
You asked for the introduction.
Thats all my organization
will guarantee.
I suppose our friend
Mr. White will have told you
that I have provided
reliable banking services
for many other
freedom fighters over the years.
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Le Chiffre?
No.
I believe in
a reasonable rate of return.
I want no risk in the portfolio.
Agreed.
And I can access it
anywhere in the world?
Yes.
I have the money,
so short another million shares
of skyfleet stock.
Sir, you must know youre betting
against the market.
No one expects this stock
to go anywhere but up.
Just do it.
Looks like our man.
Burn scars on his face.
I wonder if bomb-makers
are insured for things like that.
Hes on the move.
Hes on the move,
and hes heading straight for me.
Stop touching your ear.
-Sorry?
-Put your hand down.
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.
I need him alive.
Weeping blood comes merely
from a derangement of the tear duct
my dear general.
Nothing sinister.
All in.
I have two pair, and you have
a 17.4 percent chance
of making your straight.
When does Ellipsis expire?
-We have less than 36 hours. I can
-No. No, no.
Thats all the time I have anyway.
Give our guests
five minutes to leave
or throw them overboard.
Who the hell do they think they are?
I report to the prime minister,
even hes smart enough
not to ask me what we do.
Have you ever seen such a bunch
of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?
They dont care what we do, they care
what we get photographed doing.
And how the hell
could Bond be so stupid?
I give him double-0 status,
he celebrates by shooting an embassy.
Is the man deranged?
And where the hell is he?
In the old days, if an agent
did something embarrassing
hed have the good sense
to defect.
Christ, I miss the Cold War.
Youve got a bloody cheek.
Sorry.
Ill shoot the camera first next time.
Or yourself.
You stormed into an embassy.
You violated the only
absolutely inviolate rule
of international relationships.
And why?
So you could kill a nobody.
We wanted to question him,
not kill him.
For Gods sake. Youre supposed
to display some kind of judgment.
I did.
I thought one less bomb-maker
in the world would be good.
Exactly. One bomb-maker.
Were trying to find out how an entire
network of terrorist groups is financed
and you give us one bomb-maker.
Hardly the big picture,
wouldnt you say?
The man isnt even a true believer.
Hes a gun for hire.
And thanks to your trigger finger
we have no idea
who hired him or why.
And how the hell
did you find out where I lived?
The same way
I found out your name.
I thought M was randomly assigned.
I had no idea it stood for
Utter one more syllable
and Ill have you killed.
I knew it was too early
to promote you.
Well, I understand double-0s
have a very short life-expectancy
so your mistake will be short-lived.
Bond, this may be too much
for a blunt instrument to understand
but arrogance and self-awareness
seldom go hand in hand.
So you want me to be half monk,
half hit-man?
Any thug can kill.
I want you to take your ego
out of the equation
and to judge the situation
dispassionately.
I have to know I can trust you,
and that you know who to trust.
And since I dont know that,
I need you out of my sight.
Go and stick your head
in the sand somewhere
and think about your future.
Because these bastards
want your head.
And Im seriously considering
feeding you to them.
And Bond
dont ever break into
my house again.
Maam.
Good day, sir,
and welcome to the Ocean Club.
Hey. Hey.
Hello.
Are you going to take this
or make me wait?
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.
security to car park.
security to car park.
Absolutely incredible.
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?
Yes. But its a spur-of-the-moment
thing, and I havent got a reservation.
Okay.
-We have an ocean-view villa.
-Perfect.
Could you do me a favor?
I was here last night
and I parked my car next to
a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.
I nicked the door.
You wouldnt happen to know--?
-Mr. Dimitrios.
-Right.
If he hasnt noticed,
Im not sure Id mention it.
Isnt the type
to take bad news well.
But if I felt compelled to find him?
He has a house just up the beach.
Thank you.
-What?
-Hes in the Bahamas.
You woke me
to share his holiday plans?
Well, hes logged into
our secure website
using your name and password.
Well, how the hell
does he know these things?
Well, Im doing my best to find out.
-Whos he looking at?
-Alex Dimitrios.
That slimy bugger.
Now known associates.
Le Chiffre.
Weve had a good night,
weve had a few drinks.
How can I assist you, sir?
Good evening.
Large Mount Gay with soda, please.
-Look what just happened.
-Good job, big boy.
Yeah.
Do you mind if I join?
-Oh, good evening. How are you?
-Good evening.
Small blind, big blind.
Im in.
Bets to you.
If that was for luck,
youre two hours late.
Two hundred to you.
Bets to you.
I heard you.
Five to call.
-Actions to you.
-Pair of sevens.
Ace high.
Check or bet.
-Check.
-And to you.
Five thousand.
Five to call.
-Check.
-Check to you, sir.
All in.
No, wait.
Twenty thousand.
Table stakes. Im sorry, sir.
Okay. This is on the table.
Thats my car. Wanna bet?
Im sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.
Please, no. Give him a chance
to win his money back.
All right, show me, gentlemen.
Three kings.
There you go with my night.
Trip aces.
Aces win.
Oh, and the valet ticket.
Thank you.
Sir.
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.
No wonder he was
in such a foul mood.
My mistake.
Can I give you a lift home?
That would really send him
over the edge.
Im afraid Im not that cruel.
Well, perhaps youre just
out of practice.
Perhaps.
Well, what about
a drink at my place?
Your place?
-Is it close?
-Very.
One drink.
Good evening, sir,
and welcome back.
Welcome to my home.
Im having a hard time seeing
how this is my fault.
Its your plan.
All I did was get you the man.
A man who was under surveillance
by the British Secret Service.
Which makes me wonder
if I can trust you at all.
Then dont. I couldnt care less.
But I do care about my reputation.
I have someone else
willing to do the job.
He just needs the particulars
and payment.
You like married women,
dont you, James?
It keeps things simple.
What is it about bad men?
You, my husband.
I had so many chances
to be happy
so many nice guys.
Why cant nice guys
be more like you?
Well, because then theyd be bad.
Yes.
But so much more interesting.
What makes your husband
a bad man?
His nature, I suppose.
The nature of his work?
A mystery, Im afraid.
Im also afraid you will sleep with me
in order to get to him.
How afraid?
Not enough to stop.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Now would seem
an appropriate time.
Does ellipsis
mean anything to you?
Should I ask him about it?
Perhaps later.
Yes, dear?
Im on the last flight
tonight to Miami.
Dont wait up.
Ill be back in the morning.
Okay, I understand.
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.
Apparently hes on
the last flight to Miami
so you have all night
to question me.
In that case
were gonna need
some more champagne.
Good evening. Room service.
Good evening. Can I get a bottle
of chilled Bollinger Grand Anne
and the beluga caviar?
-With everything?
-Yes, with everything.
-And would that be for two, sir?
-What?
-For two?
-No, for one.
Wait here.
There you go. Number 53.
Dr. von Hagens Body Worlds
invites visitors
to observe the bodys various
locomotive, digestive
nervous and vascular systems.
Please may I have your attention,
ladies and gentlemen?
I believe it is something very special,
what we see here.
This is edutainment.
--fixed in dramatic
and athletic poses
that reveal the true-to-life spatial
relationships amongst organs.
Hello.
Hello.
Do not leave your vehicle unattended.
Welcome to Miami
International Airport..
Curbside parking in front
of the terminal is restricted.
-Yes.
-Its Bond. I need her now.
Im afraid she cant be disturbed.
Can I take a message?
Listen, you go and find her, tell her
to call Security at Miami Airport
because I think a bomb is about
to go off. Do it now.
-Sorry, can I put you on hold?
-I thought you might.
Bond? What the hell are you up to?
Ill call you back.
-The Skyfleet S570 prototype.
-What about it?
The largest airplane in the world will
be unveiled today at Miami Airport.
Oh, my God
Bond? Bond!
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.
Its launching today.
I gotta go.
Stop!. Stop!.
Get moving!
Lets go, lets go, lets go!
The puts expired. Im sorry,
Im not sure yet how much youve lost.
One hundred and one million,
two hundred and six thousand dollars.
Someone talked.
-You got everything you need?
-Yeah, I have.
Im gonna get a few more photos.
Quite the body count
youre stacking up.
She was tortured first.
As youd already killed her husband
she must have been
the only one left to question.
Did she know anything
that could compromise you?
No.
-Not your name, what you were after?
-No.
Dimitrios worked as a middleman.
Knew where to put his hands
on weapons
and people who could use them.
He worked with anyone
who had money.
For years he was involved with a man
we knew as Le Chiffre
a private banker
to the worlds terrorists.
He invested their money, gave them
access to it wherever they wanted.
Oh, good. Youre here.
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.
A bit of a mathematical genius
and liked to prove it by playing poker.
So you can keep an eye on me?
Yes.
When they analyzed
the stock market after 9/11
the CIA discovered a massive
shorting of airline stocks.
When the stocks hit bottom on 9/12,
somebody made a fortune.
The same thing happened
this morning with Skyfleet stock
or was supposed to.
With their prototype destroyed, the
company would be near bankruptcy.
Instead, somebody lost over
$100 million betting the wrong way.
You think its this man Le Chiffre.
Which would explain how he could
set up a high-stakes poker game
at Casino Royale in Montenegro.
Ten players, $10 million buy-in,
5 million re-buy.
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.
Good.
Then well know where hell be.
Do you want a clean kill
or to send a message?
We want him alive. Le Chiffre
doesnt have 100 million to lose.
Has he been playing the stock market
with his clients funds?
Theyre not gonna be too happy
when they find out its gone.
We cant let him win this game.
If he loses,
hell have nowhere to run.
Well give him sanctuary
in return for everything he knows.
Im putting you in the game
replacing someone
whos playing for a syndicate.
According to Villiers,
youre the best player in the Service.
Trust me, I wish it wasnt the case.
I would ask you if you could remain
emotionally detached
but I dont think
thats your problem, is it, Bond?
No.
Dont worry about keeping in touch.
Well know where you are.
You can stop pretending.
You knew I wouldnt let this drop,
didnt you?
Well, I knew you were you.
Thank you.
Im the money.
Every penny of it.
The Treasury has agreed
to stake you in the game.
Vesper.
Well, I do hope you gave
your parents hell for that.
Thank you.
Your boss must be well-connected.
Ive never seen so much
go out the door so quickly.
Or quite so stylishly.
May I ask you where it is?
Ten million was wired
to your account in Montenegro
with a contingency for 5 more
if I deem it a prudent investment.
I suppose youve given some thought
to the notion that if you lose
our government
will have directly financed terrorism.
What looks good?
So youre telling me its a matter
of probability and odds.
I was worried there was
some chance involved.
Well, only if you assume the player
with the best hand wins.
So that would be
what you call bluffing?
Youve heard the term.
Then youll also know that in poker
you never play your hand.
You play the man across from you.
-And youre good at reading people?
-Yes, I am.
Which is why
Ive been able to detect
an undercurrent
of sarcasm in your voice.
Im now assured our money
is in good hands.
You dont think
this is a very good plan, do you?
So there is a plan?
I got the impression
we were risking millions of dollars
and hundreds of lives
on a game of luck.
What else can you surmise,
Mr. Bond?
About you, Miss Lynd?
Well, your beautys a problem.
You worry you wont
be taken seriously.
Which one can say of any
attractive woman with half a brain.
True, but this one
overcompensates
by wearing
slightly masculine clothing
being more aggressive
than her female colleagues
which gives her a somewhat
prickly demeanor
and ironically enough, makes it
less likely for her to be accepted
and promoted
by her male superiors
who mistake her insecurities
for arrogance.
Now, Id have normally
gone with only child
but, you see, by the way you ignored
the quip about your parents
Im gonna have to go with orphan.
All right.
By the cut of your suit,
you went to Oxford or wherever
and actually think
human beings dress like that.
But you wear it with such disdain
my guess is
you didnt come from money
and your school friends
never let you forget it.
Which means you were
at that school by the grace
of someone elses charity,
hence the chip on your shoulder.
And since your first thought about me
ran to orphan
thats what Id say you are.
Oh, you are.
I like this poker thing.
And that makes perfect sense
since MI6 looks
for maladjusted young men
that give little thought
to sacrificing others
in order to protect
Queen and country.
You know
former SAS types with easy smiles
and expensive watches.
-Rolex?
-Omega.
Beautiful.
Now, having just met you
I wouldnt go as far as calling you
a cold-hearted bastard.
No, of course not.
But it wouldnt be a stretch
to imagine.
You think of women
as disposable pleasures
rather than meaningful pursuits.
So as charming as you are,
Mr. Bond
I will be keeping my eye
on our governments money
and off your perfectly formed arse.
You noticed?
Even accountants have imagination.
How was your lamb?
Skewered.
One sympathizes.
Good evening, Mr. Bond.
Good evening, Miss Lynd.
-Hotel Splendid, sir?
-Thats right.
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.
Its just last-minute details.
Apparently were very much in love.
Do you usually leave it to porters
to tell you this sort of thing?
Only when the romance
has been necessarily brief.
Im Mr. Arlington Beech,
professional gambler
and youre
Miss Stephanie Broadchest
-I am not.
-Youre gonna have to trust me on this.
Oh, no, I dont.
Weve been involved
for quite a while
hence the shared suite.
But my family
is strict Roman Catholic
so for appearances sake,
itll be a two-bedroom suite.
I do hate it when religion
comes between us.
Religion and a securely locked door.
Am I going to have a problem
with you, Bond?
No, dont worry. Youre not my type.
Smart?
Single.
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?
James Bond. Youll find
the reservation under Beech.
-Welcome, Mr. Bond.
-You sign that, dear.
You represent the Treasury.
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.
I will. Thank you.
Very funny.
Look, if Le Chiffre
is that well-connected
he knows who I am
and where the moneys from.
Which means hes decided
to play me anyway.
So hes either desperate
or hes overly confident
but either way, that tells me
something about him.
And all he gets in return
is a name he already has.
And now he knows
something about you.
He knows youre reckless.
Take the next one.
There isnt enough room for me
and your ego.
Mr. Bond?
-It was left for you.
-Thank you.
I love you too, M.
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
Im your contact here.
Does he know
weve been watching him?
Le Chiffre? I dont think so.
Probably because theres no we.
Just me.
Im afraid if you get
into trouble here
the cavalry wont be
coming over the nearest hill.
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday
and spent the time reestablishing
old relationships.
The chief of police and he
are now quite close.
Thats him, with the mustache.
Over my left shoulder.
Well, that could make life
quite difficult.
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.
Hes not a very subtle man.
I thought about trying to buy
his services, but we frankly
couldnt afford to outbid Le Chiffre.
I hate to say it
but the accountants seem
to be running MI6 these days.
Oh, not that I have anything
against accountants.
Many of them are lovely people.
So I decided that it was cheaper
to supply his deputy
with evidence
that we were bribing the chief.
Its amazing what you can do with
Photoshop these days, isnt it?
I think your odds are improving,
Mr. Bond.
Yes?
For you.
Something you expect me to wear?
I need you looking fabulous.
So when you walk up behind me
and kiss me on the neck
the players will be thinking
about your neckline
and not about their cards.
Do you think you can
do that for me?
Ill do my best.
Thank you.
I have a dinner jacket.
There are dinner jackets
and dinner jackets.
This is the latter.
And I need you looking like a man
who belongs at that table.
How--?
Its tailored.
I sized you up the moment we met.
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.
Thank you.
And you must be
Mr. Bliss replacement.
Welcome, Mr. Beech.
Or is that Bond?
Im a little confused.
Well, we wouldnt want that,
would we?
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
As you know, the game is no-limit
hold em poker.
Five communal cards,
two in the hole.
Monsieur Mendel here represents
the Basel Bank, Switzerland
holding the stakes.
You have each deposited
$10 million buy-in.
A further buy-in of 5 million
can be made by electronic transfer.
The money will remain in escrow
until I return
and the winner of the contest
enters his or her password
into the encryptor
whereupon the entire sum
will be wired
to any bank account
in the world you nominate.
Mr. Bond?
We proceed alphabetically.
Please be so kind as to enter
a password of your choice.
Six letters or more.
High card for dealer position.
Its Signor Gallardo.
Mr. Kaminofsky is
the small blind, $5000
and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,

Well, enjoy the game.

Werent you supposed to enter

Was I? Forgive me.
Good luck, darling.
Its up to you, Monsieur Bond.
Monsieur Bond?
Oh, Im sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?
Call.
Hello.
I suppose I dont have to tell you
how beautiful you look.
Half the people at that table
are still watching you.
Champagne.
Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Bet. Two hundred thousand.
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.
Mr. Bond?
Fold.
Send the barman over, please.
A dry martini. Wait.
Three measures Gordons,
one of vodka
half of Kina Lillet,
shake it over ice
-then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
-Yes, sir.
-You know, Ill have one of those.
-So will I.
Certainly.
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.
Thats it?
Anyone want to play poker now?
Someones in a hurry.
Would you excuse me?
You taste nice.
-I thought we dispensed with covers.
-No.
We dispensed with one that was
of no use and created another that is.
-Is he watching?
-Yes.
Good.
This is me in character pissed off
because youre losing so fast
we wont be here past midnight.
Oddly, my characters feelings
mirror my own.
Check.
-You know, thats not half bad.
-Up to you.
Im gonna have to think up
a name for that.
It was worth it to discover his tell.
What do you mean?
The twitch he has to hide
when he bluffs.
-Bluffs? He had the best hand.
-Which he got on the last card.
The odds against were 23-to-1,
and hed know that.
When he did his first raise
he had nothing.
Winning was blind luck.
-Did you get the bug?
-Yes.
Bet. One hundred thousand.
Thank you.
Its your play, Monsieur Fukutu.
Maybe he can actually pull this off.
Call.
Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mesdames, Messieurs
weve now been
playing for four hours.
Its time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.
Well, I think Ill report
on the evenings frivolities.
So?
You want to do what to me?
Youve lost me completely.
You just said you cant wait
to get me back to the room. Come on.
So, whats so damn important?
Im sorry.
Where is my money?
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
Youre holding a parcel for me.
Thank you.
Do you think you can lose that kind
of money and no one would notice?
Your money is safe.
Open that.
Youll have it tomorrow.
All of it.
I would take a hand for this betrayal,
but you need it to play cards.
Hold out your arm.
Hold out your arm, my beauty
or I will take your head.
Go to the room. Wait for me there.
Stairs.
Not a word of protest.
You should find a new boyfriend.
Go find Mathis.
Tell him Ive hidden the bodies here
and I want him to get rid of them.
Do that now. Go. Go, go!
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.
I hope our little game
isnt causing you to perspire.
A little.
But I wont consider myself to be
in trouble until I start weeping blood.
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybodys
ready, lets continue the game.
Its like theres blood on my hands.
Its not coming off.
Here, lets see.
Thats better.
You cold?
Yeah.
Here.
You have any trouble
with the bodies?
Less than some.
Being dead doesnt mean
one cant still be helpful.
Thatll keep Le Chiffre
looking over his shoulder.
Hell be wondering whos gonna
come for him next.
Hows our girl?
Melted your cold heart yet?
Call.

Bond will have to go all in
to call his bluff.
-Call.
-Call.
Gentlemen, showdown, please.
Full house. Kings and aces.
Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Its four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.
You must have thought
I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.
Please.
We will now break for one hour.
When we return,
the big blind will be 200,000.
Good game.
Well, Im gonna need the other
5 million to buy back in.
I cant do that, James.
Look, I made a mistake.
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,
but I can beat him.
-Im sorry.
-Sorry?
Sorry?
Try putting that in a sentence.
Sorry Le Chiffres gonna win
continue funding terror and killing.
That kind of sorry?
You lost because of your ego,
and that same ego cant take it.
Thats what this is about.
All youre going to do now
is lose more.
Then youre an idiot.
-Im sorry?
-I said, youre a bloody idiot.
Look in my eyes.
I can beat this man, you know that.
Get your hand off my arm.
Vodka martini.
-Shaken or stirred?
-Do I look like I give a damn?
-James.
-Get the girl out.
Funny game, right?
Sorry, I shouldve introduced myself,
seeing as were related.
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.
You should have a little faith.
If you keep your head about you,
I think you have him.
Had. Excuse me.
Youre not buying in?
No.
Listen, Im bleeding chips.
Im not gonna last much longer.
You have a better chance.
Ill stake you.
Im saying Ill give you the money
to keep going.
Just one thing. If you pull it off,
the CIA bring him in.
And what about the winnings?
Does it look like
we need the money?
Shall we up the blinds?
Why not?
Bet.
Raise.
And fold.
Excuse me, please.

Bonds been poisoned.
Hes going into cardiac arrest.
Stay calm and dont interrupt.
Because youll be dead
within two minutes
unless you do exactly what I tell you.
Im all ears.
Remove the defibrillator
from the pouch.
-Do we know what it is yet?
-Were still scanning.
Attach the leads to your chest.
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.
What do we give him? The kit
has amphetamines, antihistamines
hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?
-As soon as it reads charged
-Lidocaine. Thatll work.
Bond, dont push the red button yet.
Do you hear me? Dont push it.
His hearts gonna stop.
Theres only time for one charge
before he passes out.
Take the blue combipen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.
Thatll counteract the digitalis.
Youre going to pass out
in a few seconds.
You need to keep
your heart going.
Push the red button now, Bond.
-Bond, push the damn button!
-Do it now!
-You okay?
-Me?
-Thank you.
-Youre welcome.
-Now get yourself off to a hospital.
-I will do.
As soon as Ive won this game.
Youre not seriously
going back there?
I wouldnt dream of it.
Bet. One million.
-All in.
-Call. All in.
Gentlemen, showdown, please.
Two pair. Aces and sevens.
Queen plays. Wins.
Oh, Im sorry.
That last hand, it nearly killed me.
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game
which means no more buy-ins.
The big blind is now
Four players.

Five and seven of spades.
A straight flush.
Four to the eight.
The high hand.
Monsieur Bond wins.
-For you.
-Thank you very much.
Congratulations.
-Hes all yours.
-Much appreciated, brother.
Congratulations.
You know,
I think a celebrations in order.
You were almost dead an hour ago.
Come on, Im famished.
Thank you.
Mathis says the Americans
have made contact with Le Chiffre.
Theyre going to extract him
before dawn.
You know, I think
Ill call that a Vesper.
Because of the bitter aftertaste?
No. Because once youve tasted it,
thats all you want to drink.
-I thought that was quite a good line.
-It was a very good line.
But youre laughing at it.
-Not so much it as you.
-Well, thats fine then.
I figured out what that is.
Its an Algerian love knot.
Really? I thought it was
just something pretty.
No, you didnt.
Someone gave that to you.
Hes a very lucky man.
You can switch off so easily,
cant you?
It doesnt bother you,
killing those people?
Well, I wouldnt be very good
at my job if it did.
I dont believe you.
Youve got a choice, you know?
Just because
youve done something
doesnt mean
you have to keep doing it.
Why is it people who cant take advice
always insist on giving it?
You think I cant take
my own advice?
I think something is driving you.
And I think Ill never find out
what that is.
Mathis needs me.
Good night.
Congratulations again.
Mathis.
Im afraid your friend Mathis
is really
my friend Mathis.
Youve taken good care
of your body.
Such a waste.
You know
I never understood
all these elaborate tortures.
Its the simplest thing
to cause more pain
than a man can possibly endure.
And of course
its not only the immediate agony,
but the knowledge
that if you do not yield
soon enough
there will be little left
to identify you as a man.
The only question remains
will you yield in time?
I want the money.
Miss Lynd will give me the account
number, if she hasnt already.
So all I need from you
is the password.
The password, please.
Ive got a little itch
down there.
Would you mind?
No! No! No!
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.
Yeah!
Yes, yes, yes.
Now the whole worlds gonna know
that you died scratching my balls.
I died?
-I died?
-Yes.
Because no matter what you do,
Im not gonna give you the password.
Which means your clients
will hunt you down
and cut you into pieces of meat
while youre still breathing.
Because if you kill me
therell be nowhere else to hide.
But you are so wrong!
Because even after I slaughtered
you and your little girlfriend
your people would still welcome me
with open arms
because they need what I know.
The big picture.
Give me the password
and I will at least let her live.
Bond. Do it soon enough
and she might even be in one piece.
You really arent going to tell me,
are you?
No.
So I think
Ill feed you
what you seem not to value.
Ill get the money.
Tell them Ill get the money.
Money isnt as valuable to our
organization as knowing who to trust.
Francesco.
Francesco.
Vesper.
Vesper.
No.
Not him.
Not Mathis.
No.
Ill get the doctor.
Not him.
Any ideas?
-What?
-Why they left the two of you alive.
Where is she?
Sleeping.
Well, Im supposed
to get you to drink this.
Its just odd
killing everyone else
but leaving you and her untouched.
Almost as if someone
was trying to tell us something.
Get a look at the killer?
No.
Shame.
Drink up.
Anything else you remember?
Anything that can help us?
Help us?
Or help you?
Hello.
Hello.
You all right?
I cant resist waking you.
Every time I do, you look at me as if
you havent seen me in years.
It makes me feel reborn.
If youd just been born
wouldnt you be naked?
You have me there.
You can have me anywhere.
I can?
Yeah. Here, there,
anywhere you like.
Does this mean
that youre warming to me?
Yeah. Thats how I would describe it.
Its just that not so long ago
I would have described
your feelings towards me as.
Im trying to think
of a better word than loathing.
Im afraid Im a complicated woman.
That is something to be afraid of.
-Hello.
-Oh, perfect timing.
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?
My apologies,
I do not mean to rush
but 120 million
is a large sum of money.
It certainly is. You didnt bring
any chocolates with you?
Im afraid not.
If you would type in
the account number.
And now the password.
You can do that.
I would if I knew what it was.
V-E-S-P-E-R.
The funds have been transferred.
Sorry for disturbing you.
-Auf Wiedersehen.
-Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.
You know, James
I just want you to know
that if all that was left of you
was your smile
and your little finger
youd still be more of a man
than anyone Ive ever met.
Thats because you know
what I can do with my little finger.
-I have no idea.
-But youre aching to find out.
Youre not going to let me
in there, are you?
Youve got your armor back on.
Thats that.
I have no armor left.
Youve stripped it from me.
Whatever is left of me.
Whatever is left of me
whatever I am
Im yours.
I suppose M wont miss me
for a couple of days.
Shell be too busy sweating Mathis.
Mathis?
Remember I told you
about Le Chiffres tell?
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.
Thats how he wiped me out.
Same goes for the implant. Cant say
Im too sorry about losing that.
I cant believe it.
No, neither could I.
I thought he had my back.
But there you go, lesson learned.
Does everyone have a tell?
Yes.
Everyone.
Everyone except you.
I wonder if thats why I love you.
You love me?
Enough to quit
and float round the world with you
until one of us
has to find an honest job.
But I think thats gonna have to be you.
Ive no idea what an honest job is.
Youre serious.
Like you said
you do what I do for too long
and there wont be any soul
left to salvage.
Im leaving with
what little I have left.
Is that enough for you?
-Come on.
-No. No.
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.
Whats the time?
How much do we need
to float for a month?
Ive got plenty.
No, I want to pay for my half
of our aimless wanderings.
You stopped wearing the necklace.
Yeah. It was time.
Time enough to get over someone?
To realize sometimes
you can forget the past.
Though apparently not
your employer.
Back in one month.
Come on. Ill get the money
you get supplies.
Ill see you back here
in half an hour.
-Hello, M.
-I got your note.
Yes?
Well talk about that later.
Right now I have a lovely man
from the Treasury here
wondering if youre ever
going to deposit the winnings.
Thats a shame.
I didnt think theyd miss it.
Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.
So youll be depositing it today.
On my way to the bank right now.
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.
Hello.
Mr. Mendel? Im having trouble
accessing the funds in my account.
It was transferred
to the account number
your company gave us, Mr. Bond.
It appears the funds
are being withdrawn as we speak.
-Where?
-The Venice branch, of course.
St. Marks Square.
Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?
Ill kill her!
Allow me.
Im sorry, James.
she had a boyfriend.
A French Algerian.
They were very much in love.
He was kidnapped
by the organization behind Le Chiffre.
And they blackmailed her, threatening
to kill him unless she cooperated.
We shouldve picked up on it
but sometimes
were so focused on our enemies
we forget to watch our friends.
How are you doing?
She left her cell phone.
She must have known Id check it.
She knew you were you.
-Well, at least this clears Mathis.
-No.
-No?
-No.
We just proved that shes guilty,
not that hes innocent.
It couldve been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.
You dont trust anyone,
do you, James?
No.
Then youve learnt your lesson.
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.
Will do.
If you do need time.
Why should I need more time?
The jobs done,
and the bitch is dead.
James
did you ever ask yourself
why you werent killed that night?
Isnt it obvious?
she made a deal to spare your life
in exchange for the money.
Im sure she hoped
they would let her live.
But she must have known
she was going to her death.
And now well never know
who was behind this.
The trails gone cold.
-Hello.
-Mr. White?
We need to talk.
Who is this?
The names Bond.
James Bond.
It's time to get out.
Don't bleed to death.
Hello, Mitchell.
Bond.
The Americans are going to be
none too pleased about this.
I promised them Le Chiffre
and they got Le Chiffre.
They got his body.
If they'd wanted his soul they
should have made a deal with a priest.
Has he said anything?
No.
Going to check the perimeter Ma'am.
You look like hell.
When was the last time you slept?
Vesper's boyfriend, Yusef Kabira,
the one who was abducted in Morocco,
the one she was trying to save.
His body was washed
up on a beach in Ibiza.
We're meant to believe the fish did that to
his face. His wallet and ID were in his pocket.
Well that's convenient.
Quite.
Which is why I did a DNA check on a lock
of his hair found in Vesper's apartment.
It's not him.
A lock of his hair? I wouldn't have
thought Vesper the sentimental type.
Well we never really know anyone, do we?
But I do need to know Bond.
I need to know that I can trust you.
And you don't?
Well, it'd be a pretty cold bastard who didn't
want revenge for the death of someone he loved.
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm not going to go chasing
him. He's not important.
And neither was she.
It's clear Ma'am.
Thanks Mitchell.
Shall we?
You going to tell us who you work for?
I was always very
interested to meet you.
I'd heard so much about you from Vesper.
The real shame is, if she hadn't
killed herself, we would've had you too.
I think you would've
done anything for her.
Well you know you're not in Britain,
and God knows where you'll be tomorrow.
Which should tell you that eventually you
will tell us about the people you work with.
And the longer it takes, the
more painful we'll make it.
You really don't know anything about us.
It's so amusing because, we on
the other side, are thinking, oh...
the MI6, the CIA, they're
looking over our shoulders,
they're listening to our conversations, and
the truth is you don't even know we exist.
Oh we do now Mr. White,
and we're quick learners.
Well then, the first thing you should know
about us is that we have people everywhere.
Am I right?
Anything?
Craig Mitchell worked
for me for 8 years.
He passed a full security check
and lie detector test every year,
and didn't leave so much as a
scrap of paper to explain any of it.
I found this,
and three other bloody Christmas
presents I bought him, about the house.
I don't think he smoked.
And you had to kill him! You
couldn't bring him in for questioning,
so that we might
actually learn something.
When someone says "We've got people
everywhere", you expect it to be hyperbole.
Lots of people say that,
florists use that expression.
Doesn't mean they've got someone
working for them inside the bloody room.
What the hell is this organization Bond?
How can they be everywhere
and we know nothing about them?
I assume we found no trace of White.
No.
The agent guarding the door in the garage
was dead before you passed him on the stairs.
I passed him on the stairs? Christ!
Mitchell must have killed him when
he went out to check the perimeter.
You're lucky to be here.
You think White is still alive?
Yes I do.
What is it?
Craig Mitchell, 45 years
old, no living family,
Tell me that you know more than that.
Our money men went through every
bill in Mitchell's wallet and house.
How much did he have?
Less than 100 pounds.
And about the same in euros and dollars.
Excuse me, excuse me ma'am.
We've done a complete forensic analysis
of every note and its traceable history.
Not in the mood.
After you.
This particular note from Mitchell's
wallet might be of interest.
We introduced tagged bills into Le
Chiffre's money laundering operation,
by intercepting illegal payoffs.
We traced money through several of
his bank accounts around the world.
That's pretty thin.
At the rate money changes hands, you could
probably find a tenner in my robe with a tag.
That's true ma'am, a single bill could be
a coincidence, but what about a whole stack?
These bills from the
same series as Mitchell's
were just scanned at a bank
in Port au Prince, Haiti.
Deposited in the account of a Mr. Slate.
Impress me.
We have a Mr. Edmund Slate, returning to
Port au Prince from Heathrow this morning.
His entry documents have him
staying at Hotel Dessalines.
He's in room 325.
Thank you.
Your welcome.
Do you have any messages for 325?
No sir, the only message was about the
briefcase that was delivered earlier.
Did you want us to continue holding it?
- No, I'll take that now.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Get in!
What?
- Get in!
Fine.
You're late.
I got pulled into a meeting.
Who with?
A friend of Mr. Whites.
Don't think I know him.
It's funny,
you don't look at all like I expected.
Really?
What were you expecting?
I didn't think geologists looked so...
So?
Friend of yours?
I don't have any friends.
We didn't settle on a price.
Make me an offer.
Or we could work it
out later, over drinks.
Dominic didn't give you any trouble did he?
- No
What the hell is this?
I think someone wants to kill you.
That wasn't very nice.
You were supposed to shoot her.
Well I missed.
Get Bond.
Where is he now?
Approaching the docks, Kings Quay.
Tanner?
- I've got Bond.
Ask him about Slate.
She wants to know about Slate.
Tell her Slate was a dead end.
Slate was a dead end.
Dammit, he killed him.
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!
Touch me and I'll break your wrist.
Camille.
How nice to see you.
Alive, you mean?
I knew we shouldn't have slept together.
I think I'm starting to like you.
So you did just try and have me killed?
And that made me very sad, thinking
I would never see you again.
But, here you are.
- Dammit Dominic!
I was trying to help you!
I was trying to uncover a leak.
And you, you send someone to kill me?
Please don't talk to me like I'm stupid!
It's unattractive.
Come, I want to show you something.
Come.
There is nothing that makes me more uncomfortable
than friends, talking behind my back.
It feels like...
...ants under my skin.
It's been that way forever...
I remember when I was 15,
I had a crush on one of
my mother's piano students.
Somehow,
I overheard her saying
very nasty things about me.
I got so angry,
I took a knife...
Is that him?
I
- We only spoke on the phone.
It's such a shame because
he's one of my best geologists.
He said you asked to buy information.
No, he called me and offered
to sell me information.
Why would I come back
here if I was lying?
Because you love me.
I was doing it for you,
to stop him from betraying you.
You know what burns more
than all your bullshit?
Is that I always got the feeling
that you were only sleeping with me
to get to General Medrano.
Is that him?
You know how these
deposed dictators are,
jealous of their safety.
Stick around,
I'll introduce you.
You see the girl that
just walked in here?
Would you give her that,
tell her to call me.
You have reached Universal Exports,
Our offices are currently closed.
And you can do all this for me?
Well look at what we
did to this country.
The Haitians elect a
priest who decides to
raise the minimum wage from 38 cents to 1 dollar a day.
- Woah.
It's not a lot, but it's enough
to upset the corporations,
who were here making
T-shirts and running shoes.
So they called us and,
we facilitated a change.
The difference is my country is not some
fly speck in the middle of the caribbean.
But, we have already begun
destabilizing the government.
We'll supply the private security.
We'll pay off the right officials.
And we have 26 countries ready
to officially recognize your
new, Bolivian government.
You want your country back.
My organization can give it
to you within... the week.
You have been busy.
And in return, you want what?
A desert.
This part.
This land is worthless.
Oh, so you're getting a great deal?
You won't find oil there.
Everyone has tried.
Maybe,
Maybe not.
But we own whatever we find.
Did you know Anisto Montes?
A very powerful man in his day.
He had a beautiful Russian wife.
A dancer.
Oh, his daughter works for me...
or... did.
She's lovely.
But I don't see the resemblance.
Why don't you consider her
something to sweeten the deal?
Just promise me to drop her
over the side when you're done.
Camille, General Medrano.
Be careful what you wish for, my dear.
Have fun you two.
What the hell are you doing?!
You're welcome!
You idiot! take me back!
You know, maybe I'll do that later.
You're not one of Greene's?
Dominic Greene?
Get down!
Give me the wheel!
- Navigate!
Left!
What are you doing?!
- Hold on!
Get down!
Excuse me.
Thank you.
She's seasick.
It's Bond.
Connect Bond.
Yes?
Name check: Dominic
Greene. G-r-e-e-n-e.
Might need a little more than that,
there are a lot of Dominic Greenes.
Do you have a social
security or passport number?
No.
Anything?
Do you have anything?
Will you put her on please!
I am on, Bond.
What happened to Slate?
I'm not dwelling on the past.
I don't think you should either.
You killed him.
Largest hit: Dominic
Greene, CEO of Greene Planet.
It's a utility company,
but, Greene's been doing
a lot of philanthropic work
buying up large tracts of
land for ecological preserves.
You should be getting
his picture now.
Yep, that's him.
I'm afraid there's a firewall
around his other corporate holdings,
so we have no other information.
Get me the Americans.
Connect.
Go ahead.
Interest in Dominic
Greene, Greene Planet.
Transferring you now.
Hold for Gregory Beam please.
Thank You. Uh, hi, this
is Gregory Beam, Ma'am.
Hello, Mr. Beam.
Uh, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
We have no interest in Mr. Greene.
Thank you, Mr. Beam.
- Connection terminated.
He's a person of extreme interest.
But he just said that he wasn't...
- Tanner,
I asked about the man and she transferred
me to the section chief of South America.
How would she know to do that
if they weren't tracking him?
Bond, we have your location
as approaching an airfield...
is Greene on the move?
Yeah, I've got a tail number: Golf,
Zero, Charlie, Sierra, Charlie.
Can you give me a destination?
It's a private charter going to
Bregenz, Austria. Leaving immediately.
Tanner, authorize a charter for 007.
And Bond, if you could avoid killing every
possible lead, it would be deeply appreciated.
Yes ma'am.
I'll do my best.
- Connection terminated.
I've heard that before.
Hello.
- Hi.
Ah, welcome aboard!
Bon jour, ca va?
Hmm...
- Ca va, ca va. Come, have a seat.
Jeez!
Sorry.
How much longer?
So do we have an understanding?
Uh, yeah...
you do nothing to stop a coup
in Bolivia, and in exchange,
the new government gives America
the lease to any oil found.
If it's oil you want.
Well, you didn't find diamonds, did ya?
Ah, drill it underground, it's kept off
everybody's radar for a very long time but
you can't buy that much piping,
without somebody getting curious.
We'll have to verify the find.
I am not even admitting there is
one, you are getting this for free.
Venezuela, Brazil, now Bolivia.
With you tied up in the Middle East,
South America is falling like dominoes.
You don't need another marxist giving
national resources to the people do you?
No, we can hardly be expected to do
something about a coup we know nothing about.
Hmm, I have a... pest.
You have any idea who that is?
Sorry.
It's James Bond,
British secret service.
Don't know how I could have missed that.
I will need you to
get rid of him for me.
Yeah.
That's not gonna be a problem.
You know who Greene is and you want to put
us in bed with him, you are kidding right?
Yeah, you're right, we should
just deal with nice people.
I need to know you're
on the team, Felix.
I need to know you value your career.
Good to see you.
- Good.
Thank you.
How much more pipeline
do we need, ideally?
Are there any objections?
No.
- Not Here.
No objections.
Transfer the funds from
our Siberian holdings.
Done.
Where do the Americans stand?
The CIA doesn't care about another
dictator as long as they get their hand.
But when they find out
that they've been duped?
I'm working on that.
I'm still not sure that the Tierra
project is the best use of Quantum's time.
Perhaps we should shift
our focus to the Canadian.
This is the world's
most precious resource,
we need to control as
much of it as we can.
Bolivia must be top priority.
Can I offer an opinion?
I really think you people should
find a better place to meet.
Where do you think you're going?
Thank you.
Well, Tosca isn't for everyone.
Drop it!
So who are you working for?
Piss off.
Get rid of anything we brought
with us. We've been compromised.
I asked you who you were working for.
Is he one of ours?
No.
Then he shouldn't be looking at me.
Get me M.
Fraulein...
Hents, connect call.
We've ID'd the pictures.
Show me.
Gregor Karakov: former minister, now
owns most of the mines in Siberia,
Moeshi Saroff: former
Mossad, now telecom giant,
and Guy Haines: special
envoy to the prime minister.
Get Bond.
There's something else.
It appears Bond shot Haines'
bodyguard and threw him off a roof.
Where are you?
Did you get my pictures?
Was this a conversation?
Can you link these people?
Is that stress in your voice?
I need you to come in and debrief.
I don't have time.
Bond, you killed a man in Bregenz.
I did my best not to.
You shot him at point blank and threw him off
a roof. I'd hardly call that showing restraint.
Especially since he was a
member of special branch.
So who was he guarding?
Bond, are you missing the fact that
you killed a member of special branch?
I need you to come in.
And I would,
but right now I need to find
the men who tried to kill you.
Go back to sleep.
- Connection Terminated.
Restrict Bond's movements.
Cancel his cards.
Put an alert on his
passports, all of them.
And I want to know everything
we don't know about Haines.
Yes Ma'am.
And Tanner...
be careful who you trust with this.
Hopefully you're a better
judge of character than I am.
You want to follow your
friends to La Paz, Bolivia?
Please.
Oh...
I'm sorry sir, but this doesn't work.
Do you have another card?
No.
Could you do me a favour?
You're going to get a
phone call in a minute,
would you mind telling
them I'm headed for Cairo?
I'd be happy to.
Thank you.
Ocean Sky, Guten Abend?
Mathis.
What do you want?
Come to apologize?
You know Mathis, I think
retirement suits you.
None for him.
Sorry if he's in a bad mood today.
I need a passport and
matching credit card.
MI6 run out of plastic?
Well oddly, right now you're the
only person I think I can trust.
That is odd.
But I guess when one's young, it seems very
easy to distinguish between the right and wrong.
But as one gets older,
it becomes more difficult.
The villains and the
heros get all mixed up.
I was sorry to hear about Vesper.
I think she loved you.
Hmm, right up until the
moment she betrayed me.
She died for you.
Why did you really want to see me?
I need some information.
You have some hard friends.
This man, is some kind of facilitator.
Fingers in many pies, and
they don't leave any prints.
These men were together?
They're buying up oil pipeline.
Something called the "Tierra Project."
Do you know it?
- Destroy these.
That's Guy Haines. You don't know him?
Should I?
I suppose not.
You haven't been keeping
secrets as long as I have.
He keeps a very low profile,
but he is one of the Prime
Minister's closest advisors.
They say you're judged by
the strength of you enemies.
You know anything about Bolivia?
I was stationed in South
America for 7 years.
Well, do you have some contacts there?
A few.
What do you want to know?
Come with me.
You can't sleep?
May I fix you a drink, sir?
What are you drinking?
- I don't know, what am I drinking?
one of vodka, half a measure of
Kina Ole?
- Kina Ole, which is not vermouth.
Shaken well until it is ice cold
and served with a large,
thin slice of lemon peel.
Six of them.
That's impressive.
They're good, you should have one.
Oh, it'll just keep me awake.
So what's keeping you awake?
I was wondering why you came with me.
It takes something to
admit you were wrong.
You want a sleeping pill?
No.
Pain pills?
I have pills for everything.
Some make you taller...
some make you forget.
I am going to try and get some sleep.
Good idea.
Thank you.
Mr. Bond, my name is Fields,
I'm from the consulate.
Well, of course you are, and what
do you do at the consulate, Fields?
That's not important. My
orders are to turn you around
and put you on the first
plane back to London.
Those orders include my friend Mathis.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.
You see that? Gone such a
short time, already forgotten.
Oh, you're just saying that to hurt me.
Mr. Bond, these orders come from
the highest possible authorities.
Taxi.
Fields,
When is the next flight to London?
Tomorrow morning.
Well then we have all night.
If you attempt to flee, I will
arrest you, drop you off in jail
and take you to the plane
in chains. Understand?
Perfectly. After you.
I think she has handcuffs.
- You hope so.
He blames the water
shortage on global warming.
The colonel, who heads
the national police.
We have a reservation.
Very well.
Your name?
Miss Fields.
You're going nowhere.
So shoot me. I'd
rather stay in a morgue.
We are teachers on sabbatical,
this fits our cover.
No it doesn't, get in.
Get in.
Follow me please.
May I show you your room, Senor?
No, it's fine, thank you.
I can't find the um... the stationary.
Can you come and help me look?
You've been invited to a party.
I didn't know we had any friends here.
Greene Planet.
You're not coming?
I'm having a drink with
my friend, the colonel.
I'll see you there later.
Do you know how angry I am at myself?
I can't imagine.
You must be furious.
Do you want to go party?
Party?
But I have nothing to wear.
We'll fix that.
It might be useful to
know your real name.
Fields, just Fields.
Fields is it?
We are in a spiral of
environmental decline.
Since 1945,
has been irreversibly degraded.
The Tierra Project is just one
small part of a global network,
of equal parts, that Green Planet
has created, to rejuvenate the world,
on the verge of collapse.
I hope that tonight, you make
the decision to be part of that.
Thank you.
And have fun.
Excellent speech. Congratulations.
Wonderful speech, Dominic.
Thank you.
Miss Fields, Mr. Bond,
my friend Carlos.
Nice to meet you.
Ma'am.
Mr Bond, Mathis has spoken
a great deal about you.
I want you to know
my entire police force
is at your disposal.
Well, that could be very useful.
You know, there are people in this country spending
half their paycheck just to get clean water.
What do you think of that?
The Bolivian government is the problem.
They cut down trees, then act surprised
when the water and
soil, wash out to sea.
I couldn't agree more.
I hope this figure is to your liking.
Cherie, you shouldn't tease.
Why don't you tell them about all
the land you bought up outside Potosi?
It's been a pleasure.
Would you excuse me?
Somehow, the logging rights went to a multinational
corporation, that cut down the forests.
But only after our last government
sold the land to Greene Planet.
Oh, have I got my facts crossed?
- Yes, I think you did.
You will excuse us?
What a wonderful night.
You just cost me quite
a bit of money, darling.
You can't put a price on integrity.
I can try.
Tell me you didn't drop by
tonight just to piss on my parade,
or are you still after this
general's head, for your mantel?
A little of both.
Tell me where Medrano is, and maybe
you won't lose any more inverstors.
You are really breaking my heart,
choosing an insect like that over me.
You're going to throw me over?
Well, you've been
drinking. Maybe you slipped.
Oh... just think how much you'd miss me.
Good evening. There you are.
Would you excuse me?
Mr. Bond...
Thats a pleasure.
Well, careful with this one.
She won't go to bed with you
unless you give her
something she really wants.
It's a shame because she's really quite
stunning once you... get her on her back.
I wish I could say
this feeling was mutual.
I'm sorry Mr. Greene,
but we have to go-
Please, my friends call me Dominic.
I'm sure they do.
How much do you know about Bond, Camille?
Because he's rather a tragic case.
His MI6 says he's difficult to control.
Nice way of saying that everything
he touches, seems to wither and die.
Shall we?
Doesn't bode well for you, I'm afraid.
You two do make a
charming couple, though.
You're both... what's the expression?
Damaged goods.
Oh my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
Come on, lighten up.
You're cramping my style.
So it's British intelligence now?
What the hell do you want from me?
You're gonna show me Dominic
Greene's "Tierra Project."
Are you up to it?
- Do I have a choice?
Do you want one?
There's something horribly
efficient about you.
What a compliment.
What's the bet that Dominic Greene
has friends in the police force?
Stay here.
Buenas Noches
Now why would you want me to do that?
Mathis.
There's a hospital on
the other side of town.
Please... stay with me.
Stay here, please.
Come here.
Okay.
That's better.
That doesn't hurt.
Is Mathis your cover name?
Yes.
Not a very good one, is it?
Do we forgive each other?
I shouldn't have left you alone.
Vesper...
she did everything for you.
Forgive her.
Forgive yourself.
Is that how you treat your friends?
He wouldn't care.
Let's go.
The Foreign Secretary
is asking to see you.
What don't I know?
Rene Mathis
has been shot in Bolivia.
The police claim it was Bond.
How much did you pay him?
- Well, he wanted you.
But I left him the car as collateral.
He'll make much more
when he sells us out.
Alright, let's see if
this thing will fly.
Here...
all the information I found said
there was nothing of value there.
But Greene's geologists
had proof that there was.
My sources tell me you're
Bolivian Secret Service...
or used to be.
I think you infiltrated Greene's
organization by having sex with him.
That offends you?
- No, not in the slightest.
So what's your interest in Greene?
Well, amongst other things, he
tried to kill a friend of mine.
A woman?
- Yes,
but it's not what you think.
Your mother?
Do not ask.
What's that, down there?
That's a sinkhole, there
are a few around here.
Just for the record,
I wasn't with Greene for my-
I think we lost him.
He's coming for us!
It's right behind you!
Here! Put that on!
Come on!
According to the Bolivians,
it was a routine stop,
and when they discovered Mathis'
body, Bond disarmed and shot them.
Of course there are no
witnesses to prove otherwise.
I need something. I
can't go in there unarmed.
I'm sorry, there's nothing.
Come in.
What's today's excuse?
That Bond is legally blind?
No, Minister.
I don't think I need to tell
you how upset the P.M. is.
With respect, the P.M.
has my direct line.
And he'd of used it, if
he'd wanted to speak to you.
I'm sorry M, times have changed. We've
had long discussions with our cousins.
Mr. Greene's interests
and ours now align.
Minister, this man is a major
player in one of the most dangerous
and powerful organizations-
- We've never even heard of.
Foreign policy cannot be conducted
on the basis of hunches and innuendo.
Then give us time to gather enough
evidence, so you can make informed decisions.
Fine.
Say you're right. Say
Greene is a villain.
If we refused to business with villians,
we'd have almost no one to trade with.
The world's running out of oil, M.
The Russians aren't playing ball,
the Americans and Chinese
are dividing up what's left.
Right or wrong doesn't come into
it. We're acting out of necessity.
Bond... is running wild. Who's
to say he hasn't been turned?
Pull him in, or the
Americans will put him down.
I think I've found a way out.
You're freezing.
I'm fine.
So what is it that
Greene has and you want?
It's not Greene, it's Medrano.
The man you met in Haiti.
My father, worked for
the military junta.
He was a very cruel man.
But he was my father.
When I was a small child, the opposition
send General Medrano to our house.
He shot my father... did things
to my mother and my sister...
and then strangled them while I watched.
I was to young to be any trouble.
So he just smiled at me...
and set the house on fire.
He left his mark.
So, when I pulled you off the boat...
I waited years for that chance.
I apologize.
Seems we're both using
Greene to get to somebody.
You lost somebody?
I did, yes.
You catch whoever did it?
No, not yet.
Tell me when you do,
I'd like to know how it feels.
We should go.
You ready?
They've used dynamite.
This used to be a riverbed.
Greene isn't after the
oil, he wants the water.
We can't leave it like this.
It's one dam.
He's creating a drought,
and he'll build others.
Excuse me sir. Your wife left a message.
The English woman. She left
it for you this morning.
Thank you.
- My pleasure.
What is it?
Would you mind waiting down here?
I'll be outside.
So that's what she meant.
I hope you can trust these men.
Just a moment. It's Tanner.
Yes?
We've got the girl downstairs, she says to
tell you she's sorry, but this isn't her fight.
It isn't, let her go.
She isn't our concern.
Well, I'm disappointed.
You are?
How much oil did the
Americans promise you?
This isn't about oil.
- Well that's good, because there isn't any.
It's about trust.
You said you weren't
motivated by revenge.
I'm motivated by my duty.
No.
I think you're so blinded by inconsolable
rage that you don't care who you hurt.
When you can't tell your friends
from your enemies, it's time to go.
You might like to still hold your
theory about there being no oil.
Her lungs are full of it.
It was Greene.
No doubt. But why?
It's just misdirection-
- I mean why her Bond?
She was just supposed to send you home.
She worked in an office,
collecting reports.
Look how well you charm works, James.
They'll do anything for you, won't they?
How many is that now?
You're removed from duty and suspended,
pending further investigation.
You'll give whatever weapons you have
to these men and leave with them now.
Miss Fields showed true bravery. I
want that mentioned in your report.
Now you and need to see this through.
There's nowhere to go.
There's a capture or
kill order out on you.
Who would've done that?
Ma'am?
- Find out where he's going.
He's onto something.
Ma'am, the CIA is insisting-
- I don't give a shit about the CIA,
or their trumped up evidence.
He is my agent, and I trust him.
Go on.
Get in.
You gonna try and shoot me?
I said get in.
You're gonna get botulism
if you keep drinking that.
It's bottled water.
It probably came from some stream,
just around the corner from here,
bunch of little kids peeing in it.
That's why I eat the peppers.
- Well, all I'm saying is,
you can't trust a
damn thing around here!
Lincoln Exportar, beunos noches.
You know you could
just answer CIA, Felix.
A taxi driver told me
where the office was.
Well, if we're so easy to find,
James, you really should come visit.
Or maybe you should come out
and see some more of the city.
I heard a rumor you'd gone native.
Felix.
You know, I was just wondering
what South America would look like,
if nobody gave a damn
about coke or communism.
It always impressed me the way
you boys would carve this place up.
I'll take that as a
compliment coming from a Brit.
Are you sure you're
playing with the right side?
Regimes change once a week down here,
Medrano will be no
dirtier than the next guy.
Oh you see, that's what I
like about U.S. intelligence,
you'll lie down with anybody.
- Including you, brother,
including you.
- Do you know you're being played?
Dominic Greene is gonna suck this place dry,
and then he's gonna more on and you're gonna
be left picking up the broken crockery.
What can I tell you? There's
no such thing as a free lunch.
You see Felix, I don't think you're
half as cynical as you make out to be.
You don't know me.
Why?
Just because you didn't come alone?
How long have I got?
Well, that doesn't give
us a lot of time, does it?
Medrano can't move until he pays
off the army and the police chief.
Greene's bringing him his money now, at a hotel
called "Perola de las Dunas", in the desert.
Thank you, Felix.
James.
Move your ass.
What the hell happened?
What'd you tell him?
Just what we agreed on.
What're you doing?
It's slide is cocked.
Maybe you should check your own.
I will.
Have you ever killed someone?
The training will tell you that when the
adrenalin kicks in, you should compensate.
But part of you is not gonna believe the
training, because this kill is personal.
Take a deep breath.
You only need one shot,
make it count.
In euros, as requested.
The dollar isn't what it once was.
The cost of the war.
I'm afraid that the corruption in this
current government, can no longer be tolerated.
Presidente?
And mine?
Very tough for you to sign over my land.
My first official act.
And this, if you would.
What is this?
As of this moment, my organization owns
more than 60% of Bolivia's water supply.
For this contract states
that, your new government,
will use us as utilities provider.
This is double what we are paying now.
Oh, well, then don't sign it.
But, you should know something
about me and the people I work with.
We deal with the left or the
right. Dictators or liberators.
If the current president had been more
agreeable, I wouldn't be talking to you.
If you decide not to sign,
you'll wake up with your balls
in your mouth, and your willing
replacement standing over you.
If you doubt that, then shoot me, take
that money, and have a good night's sleep.
You and I had a mutual friend!
Sounds like you just lost another one!
Not this way, not this
way! I can't, I can't!
Make your shot.
Take a deep breath.
Make it count.
Come on!
Wait here.
You promised that you'd-
Let you go?
I answered your questions.
I told you what you wanted
to know about Quantum.
Yes, you did.
And your friends would know that,
so they're probably looking for you.
But the good news is...
you're in the middle of the desert.
Here,
I bet you make it 20 miles,
before you consider drinking that.
Goodbye, Mr. Greene.
Thank you.
It's my pleasure.
Are you alright?
Fine.
But I keep thinking,
he's dead, and now what?
Well, the dam we saw
will have to come down.
And there'll be others too. Someone
who worked for Greene might be of help.
Not a bad idea.
Do you think I'll be able to sleep now?
I don't think the dead
care about vengeance.
I wish... I could set you free.
But your prison is in there.
Fine, anything for an easy life.
Sit down.
Sit down!
It's okay, baby.
You're Canadian?
You work in Canadian Intelligence?
It's alright, I know you do.
And knowing this man,
I'd guess you have access to
some very sensitive material,
which you're gonna be forced to give up.
His life will be threatened, and
because you love him, you won't hesitate.
It's a beautiful necklace.
Did he give it to you?
I have one just like it.
He gave it to a friend of mine.
Someone very close to me.
Your name is?
- Corine.
Corine.
Corine, I suggest you leave
now, you contact your people
and you tell them to check
their seals, they have a leak.
Do it now, please.
This man and I have
some unfinished business.
Thank you.
Please,
make it quick.
Is he still alive?
He is.
I'm surprised.
Did you find what you were looking for?
Yes.
- Good.
I assume you have no regrets.
- I don't.
What about you?
Of course not. It
would be unprofessional.
They found Greene dead in the middle
of the Bolivian desert, of all places.
Two bullets in the back of his skull.
They found motor oil in his stomach.
Does that mean anything to you?
Wish I could help.
You'll be glad to know, I straightened
things out with the Americans.
Your friend Leiter has been promoted.
He'll replace Beam.
Well then, the right
people kept their jobs.
Something like that.
Congratulations, you were right.
About what?
About Vesper.
Ma'am.
Bond.
I need you back.
I never left.

I've considered every option.

Three months ago, you lost the

of almost every NATO
agent embedded in

A list which, in the eyes of

And now that they've
accessed M's codes,
it's only a matter of time before
they're able to decrypt the list.
Q-Branch have been analyzing the
picture but so far nothing.
The general feeling is it's
probably someone from her past.
Perhaps when she was running
things in Hong Kong.
She's no idea what
it all means.
You believe that?
The truth is, we don't have
a clue who took the list
(GRUNTING)
or what they plan
to do with it.
We can always do this later.
You know what? Let's.
(DOOR BANGS SHUT)

I'd like to start with some
simple word associations.
Just tell me the first wor d
that pops into your head.
For example, I might say
"Day" and you might say...
Wasted.
All right.
Gun.
Shot. Agent.
Provocateur.
Woman.
Provocatrix.
Heart.
Target.
Bird.
Sky.
M.
Bitch.
MAN: Sunlight.
Swim.
Moonlight. Dance.
. Murder.
Employment.
Country. England.
Skyfall.
Skyfall.
Done.
Well, this is going well.
(GROANS IN PAIN)
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS SOFTLY)
Get these analyzed.
For her eyes only.
She's ready for you.
I'm sorry, have we met before?
I'm the one who
should say "sorry".
It was only four ribs.
Some of the less vital organs.
Nothing major.
? Not enough
excitement in Istanbul
I've been reassigned.
Temporary suspension
from field work.
Really? Mmm.
Something to do
with killing 007.
Well, you gave it
your best shot.
That was hardly my best shot.
I'm not sure I could
survive your best.
I doubt you'll get the chance.
Well, do me a favor, will you? If
they do ever let you back out there,
warn me first.
I'm assisting Gareth
Mallory in the transition,
and then I'll be
back in the field.
That's what you want?
Yes, of course.
It's not for everyone.
Ah, 007. It's this way.
. In your defense, a moving
target is much harder to hit.
Then you better keep moving.
The whole office
goes up in smoke
and that bloody
thing survives.
Your interior decorating tips have
always been appreciated, 007.
I hope I haven't
missed anything.
The PM does prattle
on in a crisis.
Bond.
Mallory.
I've just been reviewing
Bond's tests.
It seems you've passed...
by the skin of your teeth.
You're back on active service.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I'll, um...
I'll be outside.
I only have one question.
Why not stay dead?
You have the perfect way out.
Go and live quietly somewhere.
Not many field agents get
to leav e this cleanly.
Do you get out in
the field much?
. You don't need to be an
operative to see the obvious.
It's a young man's game.
Look, you've been
seriously injured.
There's no shame in saying
you've lost a step.
The only shame would be not
admitting it until it's too late.
Hire me or fire me. It's
entirely up to you.
If he says he's
ready, he's ready.
Perhaps you can't see
it, or maybe you won't.
What exactly are you implying?
You're sentimental about him.
As long as I'm head of this department,
I'll choose my own operatives.
Fair enough.
Good luck, 007.
Don't cock it up.
. We've analyzed the
shrapnel fragments
t You're lucky it
wasn't a direct hi
or it would have
cut you in half.
It's a depleted uranium shell.
Military grade.
Hard to get,
extremely expensive,
and only used by a select few.
Recognize anyone?
Him.
TANNER: Okay. Name's Patrice.
He's a ghost. No known residence
or country of origin.
So how do we find him?
Well, luckily, we still have one
or two friends left in the CIA.
They're after him for the
Yemeni ambassador' s murder,
and they're getting close.
Intel is he's going
to be in Shanghai
in two days time,
probably on a job.
You're to go there and await
further instructions.
If he turns up, he's yours.
Find out who he works for
and who has the list.
Then terminate
him, for Ronson.
With pleasure.
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?
No.
Report to the new Quartermaster
for your documentation.
He hasn't set up shop
yet, but Tanner will
put you two together.
Good luck.
Thank you.
You are ready for this?
Yes, ma'am.
I didn't know Bond
passed the tests.
He didn't.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Always makes me feel
a little melancholy.
A grand old warship being
ignominiously hauled away for scrap.
(SIGHS)
The inevitability of
time, don't you think?
What do you see?
A bloody big ship.
Excuse me.
I'm your new Quartermaster.
. You must be joking.
Why, because I'm not
wearing a lab coat?
Because you still have spots.
My complexion is
hardly relevant.
Well, your competence is.
Age is no guarantee
of efficiency.
And youth is no guarantee
of innovation.
I'll hazard I can
do more damage
on my laptop sitting
in my pajamas
before my first
cup of Earl Grey
than you can do in a
year in the field.
Oh, so why do you need me?
Every now and then a
trigger has to be pulled.
Or not pulled.
It's hard to know which
in your pajamas.
Q.
. Ticket to Shanghai.
Documentation and passport.
Thank you.
And this.
Walther PPK/S 9mm short.
There's a micro-dermal
sensor in the grip.
It's been coded to your palm
print so only you can fire it.
Less of a random killing machine,
more of a personal statement.
And this?
Standard issue
radio transmitter.
Activate it and it
broadcasts your location.
Distress signal.
And that's it.
A gun...
and a radio.
Not exactly Christmas, is it?
Were you expecting
an exploding pen?
We don't really go
in for that anymore.
. Good luck out
there in the field.
And please return the
equipment in one piece.
Brave new world.

I've got some new information.
Aren't you a little overqualified

It's all part of the

And Q's afraid of flying.
Of course he is.
So whoever stole the list
has already decrypted it.
They posted the first
five names on the web.
Well, it was only
a matter of time.
Well, that's just the start.
They're posting five more next
week, and the week after.
It's some kind of

How very traditional.
Well, I like to do some
things the old-fashioned way.
Sometimes the old

Are you putting your

already briefed
me on the list.
Raising the
tantalizing question
of what you're
really doing here.
My official directive
was to help...
"in any way I can."
Like spying for Mallory.
You know, Mallory's not
as bad as you think.
He's a bureaucrat.
You should do your homework.
Gareth Mallory was a
Lieutenant Colonel...
Lieutenant Colonel in Northern
Ireland, Hereford Regiment.
Spent three months at
the hands of the IRA.
(CHUCKLES)
. So there's more to
him than meets the eye
(INHALES DEEPLY)
We'll see.
Keep still.
This is the tricky part.
Now that's better.
You look the part now.
Mm-hmm. Mmm.
And what part's that?
Old dog,

Good evening.
EVE: Evening.
Don't touch your ear.
I've got three exits,
lots of blind spots.
. EVE: I've got them covered.
You look beautiful
in that dress.
. You don't scrub
up so bad yourself.
It's amazing what one can do
with an extra pair of hands.
You're telling me.
Do you gamble?
I like a little
flutter now and then.
Who doesn't like
to take chances?
? Good evening, sir.
How may I help you
I'd like to cash
this in, please.
One moment, sir.
Good fortune tonight, sir.
Let's hope so.
With compliments of the house.
Thank you.
Now you can afford
to buy me a drink.
Maybe I'll even
stretch to two.
I'm guessing I've got four
million euros in here.
Not bad. I like this game.
Why don't we play another?
. I don't gamble
I'm not very lucky.
. A little like our
friend in Shanghai
I've been waiting to see
who would redeem the chip.
You made such a bold entrance
into our little drama.
Did I over-complicate
the plot?
Who doesn't appreciate the
occasional twist, Mr...?
Bond.
James Bond.
Severine.
So, Mr. Bond, shall we discuss your
next performance over that drink?
I'd like that.
Will your friends
be joining us?
That, I'm afraid,
is inevitable.
EVE: She's pretty.
Now, now.
If you like that
sort of thing.
(WHISPERING) I'll
keep you posted.
(CLINKS)
(ICE RATTLING)
Perfect.
Would you mind if I asked
you a business question?
Depends on the question.
It has to do with death.
A subject in which
you're well-versed.
And how would you know that?
Only a certain kind of woman
wears a backless dress
with a Beretta 70
strapped to her thigh.
One can never be
too careful when
. handsome men in
tuxedos carry Walthers
I am correct in assuming
you killed Patrice?
Yes.
Might I ask why?
I want to meet your employer.
Be careful what you wish for.
You're scared.
Thank you for the drink,
Mr. Bond.
You put on a good show.
But ever since we sat
down, you haven't stopped
looking at your bodyguards.
Now, three of them
is a bit excessive.
They're controlling you.
They're not protecting you.
The tattoo on your wrist
is Macau sex trade.
You belonged to one of the houses.
What were you? 12? 13?
I'm guessing he
was your way out.
Perhaps you thought
you were in love.
But that was a long time ago.
You know nothing about it.
I know when a woman is afraid
and pretending not to be.
How much do you
know about fear?
All there is.
Not like this.
Not like him.
I can help you.
I don't think so.
Let me try.
How?
Bring me to him.
Can you kill him?
Yes.
Will you?
Someone usually dies.
(LAUGHS)
Perhaps you can.
When I leave, they're
going to kill you.
If you survive, I'm on the Chimera.

ANCHORMAN (OVER
TV): Good evening.
The controversy surrounding the
Ministry of Defence has escalated today
as images of the Husein assassination
continue to circulate.
We should warn
you, some viewers
might find these
images disturbing.
Captain Husein, an MI6 operative
embedded in the Middle East,
was one of the five
agents exposed
in what is now
being considered
the greatest internal security
breach in modern British history.
The Prime Minister continues to
express public support for MI6
while the opposition has
taken the position...
Has taken the position we're a
bunch of antiquated bloody idiots
fighting a war we don't understand
and can't possibly win.
Look, three of my agents
are dead already.
Don't embroil me
in politics now.
The Prime Minister's ordered an inquiry.
You'll have to appear.
Oh, standing in the stocks at midday?
Who's antiquated now?
For Christ's sake, listen to yourself.
We're a democracy,
accountable to the people
we're trying to defend.
We can't keep working in the shadows.
There are no more shadows.
? You don't get this, do you.
Whoever's behind this, whoever's
doing it, he knows us.
He's one of us. He comes
from the same place as Bond.
The place you say
doesn't exist.
The shadows.
(CLICKS)
It's not too late. We
could turn back now.
(GUNS COCKING)
I wouldn't be so sure.
They abandoned it
almost overnight.
He made them think there was a
leak at the chemical plant.
It's amazing the panic you can
cause with a single computer.
He wanted the island,
so he took it.
Does he always get
what he wants?
More than you know.
(MAN SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE)
I'm sorry.
(ELEVATOR CLANKING)
Hello, James. Welcome.
? Do you like the island
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
My grandmother had an island.
Nothing to boast of. You could
walk around it in an hour.
But still, it was, it
was a paradise for us.
T One summer, we went for a visi
and discovered the place had
been infeste d with rats!
They'd come on a fishing boat and
gorged themselves on coconut.
So how do you get rats
off an island? Hmm?
My grandmother showed me.
We buried an oil drum
and hinged the lid,
. then wired coconut
to the lid as bait.
. And the rats would come
for the coconut and..
(MAKES CLINKING NOISE)
they would fall into the drum.
And after a month, you
have trapped all the rats.
But what do you do then?
Throw the drum into the ocean?
Burn it? No.
You just leave it.
And they begin to get hungry.
And one by one...
(MAKES GNAWING NOISE)
they start eating each other
until there are only two left.
The two survivors.
And then what? Do you kill them?
No.
You take them and release
them into the trees.
But now they don't
eat coconut anymore.
Now they only eat rat.
You have changed their nature.
The two survivors,
this is what she made us.
I made my own choices.
(CHUCKLES) You think you did.
That's her genius.
Station H. Am I right?
Hong Kong.
Mm-hmm.
'86 to '97.
Back then, I was her favorite.
And you're not nearly the agent
I was, I can tell you that.
(CHUCKLES)
Just look at you, barely held together
by your pills and your drink.
Don't forget my pathetic
love of country.
(LAUGHS)
You're still clinging to your
faith in that old woman.
When all she does is lie to you.
She never lied to me.
No? No.
What did you score in your
marksmanship evaluation?
(LAUGHS)
Did she tell you the psychologist
cleared you for duty?
Yes. No. No.
(SIGHS)
Medical evaluation: Fail.
Physical evaluation: Failed.
Psychological
evaluation: "Alcohol"
"and substance
addiction indicated."
"Pathological rejection
of authority"
"based on unresolved
childhood trauma."
"Subject is not approved
for field duty"
"and immediate suspension
from service advised."
What is this if not betrayal?
She sent you after me knowing you're
not ready, knowing you'll likely die.
Mommy was very bad!
Hmm?
Ooh.
? See what she's done to you.
Well, she never
tied me to a chair.
Her loss.
Are you sure this is about M?
. It's about her.
And you, and me.
You see, we are the
last two rats.
We can either eat
each other...
Hmm?
Or eat everyone else.
How you're trying to
remember your training now.
What's the regulation
to cover this?
Well, first time for everything.
Yes?
What makes you think
this is my first time?
Oh, Mr. Bond!
All that physical stuff...
So dull, so dull.
Chasing spies...
(LAUGHS) so old-fashioned!
Your knees must
be killing you.
England.
The Empire! MI6!
You're living in
a ruin as well,
. you just don't know it yet.
At least here there are no old ladies
giving orders and no little...
Bip!
Gadgets from those
fools in Q-Branch.
If you wanted, you could pick your
own secret missions. As I do.
Name it.
Name it.
Destabilize a multinational
by manipulating stocks...
Bip. Easy.
. Interrupt transmission s from
a spy satellite over Kabul..
(POPS) Done.
Hmm. Rig an election in Uganda.
All to the highest bidder.
Or a gas explosion in London.
Just point and click.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
So what's yours?
Resurrection.
Let me show you something.
(DOOR CREAKS)
(MAN SINGING IN FRENCH,
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS)
Tells a story, doesn't it?
They left the
island so quickly,
they couldn't decide
what to take,
what to leave, what
was important.
And seeing this every day reminds
me to focus on the essentials.
There's nothing... nothing
superfluous in my life.
When a thing is redundant,
it is eliminated.
A particular favorite
of yours, I understand.
So, what's the toast?
"To the women we love"?
Hmm.
Darling.
Darling, your lovers are here.
No, no, no, no.
Stand up straight. Keep still.
And whatever you do,
don't lose your head.
Don't lose...
your head.
Don't lose your head.
Time to redeem your
marksmanship scores.
Let's see.
Who can be the first to knock
the glass from her head?
And just to be sporting,
I'll let you go first.
(COCKS GUN)
Let's see who ends up on top.
. (SIGHS) Oh, I can't believe it
I can't believe it! Did
you really die that day?
Is there any, any of
the old 007 left?
My turn.
I win. What do
you say to that?
(SIGHS) It's a waste
of good Scotch.
What are you going to do now? Take
me back to her? All on your own?
? Who says I'm on my own
(HELICOPTERS APPROACHING)
It's the latest thing
from Q-Branch.
It's called a radio.
All right, time to say hello.
(KEYPAD BEEPS)
You're smaller
than I remember!
Whereas I barely
remember you at all.
Strange. For me, it feels
just like yesterday.
Are you surprised?
Not particularly. But then you
always were a slippery one.
Maybe that's why you
liked me so much.
You flatter yourself.
No remorse.
(SIGHS)
Just as I had imagined.
Regret is unprofessional.
(LAUGHS)
"Regret is unprofessional."
They kept me for five months in a
room with no air. They tortured me.
And I protected your secrets.
I protected you.
But they made me suffer.
And suffer.
And suffer.
Until I realized...
it was you who betrayed me.
You betrayed me.
So, I had only one thing left.
My cyanide capsule in
my back left molar.
You remember, right?
So I broke the tooth and...
bit into the capsule.
And it...
It burned all my insides.
But I didn't die.
Life clung to me
like a disease.
And then...
I understood why
I had survived.
I needed to look in your
eyes one last time.
Well, I hope it was worth it.
Mr. Silva, you're going to be
transferred to Belmarsh Prison
where you'll be
remanded in custody
until the Crown
Prosecution Service
deem you fit to
stand trial for...
Say my name. Say it.
My real name.
. I know you remember it.
Your name is on
the memorial wall
of the very building
you attacked.
I will have it struck off.
Soon your past will be as
nonexistent as your future.
I'll never see you again.
Do you know what
it does to you?
Hydrogen cyanide?
Look upon your work,
Mother.
(CHUCKLING SOFTLY)
(LAUGHING)
Let me know what you
recover from his computer.
Has he transmitted the lists? If so, to whom?
I want this resolved.
Yes, ma'am.
His name is Tiago Rodriguez.
He was a brilliant agent.
But he started operating beyond
his brief, hacking the Chinese.
The handover was coming up and they
were onto him, so I gave him up.
I got six agents in return
and a peaceful transition.
We should go, ma'am. Board of
Inquiry begins in 30 minutes.
I want to know what's
on that computer.
Now, looking at
Silva's computer,
it seems to me he's done a number
of slightly unusual things.
He's established failsafe
protocols to wipe the memory
if there's any attempt
to access certain files.
Only six people in the world could
program safeguards like that.
Of course there are.
Can you get past them?
I invented them.
Right, then.
Let's see what you've
got for us, Mr. Silva.
We're in.
(EXHALES)
Sir, what do you make of this?
It's his Omega site.
Most encrypted level he has.
Looks like obfuscated code
to conceal its true purpose.
Security through obscurity.
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I might have order?
I'd like to begin
the proceedings.
We're gathered today to
address important issues
concerning the future of
our national security.
(GROANS LOUDLY)
Going somewhere?
So you believe your stewardship
of MI6 during the recent crisis
has been up to scratch?
Well, I believe we have
apprehended the responsible party
and are taking all
necessary steps
to ensure that the sensitive
information is contained.
Oh,
so it's a job well done.
. I'm not saying it's
gone perfectly, but..
You'll forgive me for not
putting up the bunting.
I find it rather difficult
to overlook monumental
security breaches
and dead operatives
for which you are almost
single-handedly responsible.
He's using a polymorphic
engine to mutate the code.
Whenever I try to gain
access, it changes.
It's like solving a Rubik's
cube that's fighting back.
Stop.
Go in on that.
Granborough.
Granborough Road. It's an old Tube
station on the Metropolitan Line.
Been closed for years.
Use that as a key.
Oh, look, it's a map!
It's London.
Subterranean London.
What's going on? Why
are the doors open?
(COMPUTER BEEPING)
Oh, no.
Can someone tell me how the
hell he got into our system?
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit, shit, shit.
He hacked us.
(ALARM BLARING)
Oh, no.
Q.
He's gone.
I'm in a stairwell
below isolation.
Do you read me, Q?
I can hear you. I'm
looking for you.
Got you. Tracking
your location.
Just keep moving forward.
Enter the next service
door on your right.
If you're through that door,
you should be in the Tube.
I'm in the Tube.
Bond, this isn't an escape.
This was years in the planning.
He wanted us to capture him, he
wanted us to access his computer.
It was all planned.
Blowing up HQ. Knowing
the emergency protocols.
Knowing we'd
retreat down here.
I've got all that. It's what he's
got planned next that worries me.
District Line is the closest. There's
a service door on your left.
Got it.
It won't open.
It will. Put your
back into it.
Why don't you come down here
and put your back into it?
(GRUNTING)
No, it's stuck.
Oh, good. There's
a train coming.
Hmm. That's vexing.
I'm through.
Told you.
We alerted security.
Police are on their way.
Where are you now?
Temple Tube station.
Along with half of London.
Oh, I see you. There you are.
I know where I am, Q.
Where's he?
Give us a second. I'm
looking for him.
ANNOUNCER: Mind the gap.
BOND: There's too many people.
I can't see him.
Welcome to rush
hour on the Tube.
Not something you'd
know much about.
Mind the gap.
The train's leaving.
Do I get on the train?
Don't get on. I'm not sure he's on it.
Give us a minute.
Do I get on the train?
Bond.
What? Get on the train.
He's keen to get home.
Will you open the
door, please?
Open the door.
Health and Safety. Carry on.
Q: Where are you?
Take a wild guess, Q.
He's in disguise,
dressed as a policeman.
Of course he is.
Where's he going?
Where's he going?
He's going for M. Tell Tanner.
Get her out of there.
You've overlooked, or chosen
to ignore, hard evidence
and consistently,
almost obstinately...
Silva's escaped.
Bond's in pursuit.
We need to get you to a
secure location immediately.
I'll be damned if I'm
gonna show her my back.
Are we straining
your attention?
No. Please, Minister, proceed.
Excuse me.
Move! Move!
(PEOPLE SHOUTING)
(CHUCKLES)
(LAUGHING)
It's as if you
insist on pretending
we still live in a
golden age of espionage
where human intelligence was
the only resource available.
Well, I find this rather
old-fashioned belief
demonstrates a reckless
disregard for...
Excuse me, Minister, I
don't mean to interrupt,
but just for the
sake of variety,
might we actually hear
from the witness?
Of course.
Thank you.
Oh!
I won't miss next
time, Mr. Silva.
Not bad. Not bad, James,
for a physical wreck.
Oi. Thank you.
You caught me.
(SIGHS)
Now, here's your prize.
The latest thing from
my local toy store.
It's called radio.
Whew!
I do hope that wasn't for me.
(LAUGHS) No.
But that is.
(TRAIN APPROACHING)
(SIRENS WAILING)
M: Chairman, Ministers.
Today I've
repeatedly heard how
irrelevant my
department has become.
Why do we need agents?
The Double-O section?
Isn't it all rather quaint?
Well, I suppose I see a
different world than you do.
And the truth is that
what I see frightens me.
I'm frightened because our enemies
are no longer known to us.
They do not exist on a map.
They're not nations.
They are individuals.
Look around you.
Who do you fear?
Can you see a face? A uniform?
A flag? No.
Our world is not more
transparent now.
It's more opaque.
It's in the shadows.
That's where we
must do battle.
So, before you declare us
irrelevant, ask yourselves,
how safe do you feel?
I've just one more
thing to say.
My late husband was a
great lover of poetry.
And, um...
I suppose some of it sunk in,
despite my best intentions.
And here today I remember
this, I think from Tennyson:
"We are not now that strength,
"which in old days Moved
earth and heaven;
; "That which we are, we are.
"One equal temper
of heroic hearts,
"Made weak by time"
"and fate,"
"but strong in will."
"To strive, to seek,"
"to find"
"and not to yield."
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Go, go, go, go!
Move!
Move! Go! Move!
(SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE)
Are you kidnapping me?
That would be one way
of looking at it.
Too many people are
dying because of me.
If he wants you, he'll
have to come and get you.
We've been one step behind
Silva from the start.
It's time to get out in
front, change the game.
And I'm to be the bait?
All right. But just us.
No one else.
Q? I need help.
I'm tracking the car.
Where are you going?
I've got M. We're
about to disappear.
What?
I need you to lay a trail of
breadcrumbs impossible to follow
for anyone except Silva.
Think you can do it?
I'm guessing this isn't
strictly official.
Not even remotely.
So much for my promising
career in espionage.
I'm not hiding in there, if
that's your brilliant plan.
We're changing vehicles.
Trouble with company cars
is they have trackers.
Oh, and I suppose that's
completely inconspicuous.
Get in.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
It's not very
comfortable, is it?
? Are you gonna
complain the whole way.
Oh, go on then, eject me.
See if I care.
Where are we going?
Back in time.
Somewhere we'll
have the advantage.
It's a fine line.
Make the breadcrumb too
small and he might miss it.
Too big and Silva
will smell a rat.
But do you think even Silv a
will be able to spot that?
He's the only one who could.
Sir.
Oh.
What are you doing?
We're just... monitoring.
Creating a false tracking
signal for Silva to follow.
Well, sir, um... Well, no.
Excellent thinking.
Get him isolated.
Send him on the A9.
It's the direct route.
You can monitor his
progress more accurately
and confirm it with
the traffic cameras.
But what if the PM finds out?
Then we're all buggered.
Carry on.

It's nice to see you, too.

Pleased to meet you, Emma.
Mr. Kincade.
, You're a tad late.
They've sold the place
when they thought
you were dead.
It seems they were wrong.
What are you doing here?
Some men are
coming to kill us.
But we're gonna
kill them first.
. Then we'd better get ready.
Do we still have a gun room?
Ah.
They sold the lot to a collector
from Idaho or some such place.
They were shipped
out weeks ago.
There's just...
your father's old
hunting rifle.
We couldn't let that go.
And this is what we've got.
There might be a couple of sticks
of dynamite from the quarry.
But if all else fails,
sometimes the old
ways are the best.
So who is it we're
supposed to be fighting?
No "we" in it, Kincade.
This is not your fight.
Try and stop me, you
jumped-up little shit.

Now, remember what I taught you.
Don't let it pull to the left.
I'll do my best.
What did you say you
did for a living?
Emma!
I brought you some things.

It's a beautiful old house.
She is.
And like all great ladies, she
still has her secret ways.

Yeah, from Reformation times.

is the place to come.

died, he hid in here for two days.
When he did come out...
he wasn't a boy anymore.
Eh. Must get on.
I fucked this up, didn't I?
No.
You did your job.
I read your obituary of me.
And?

one or two close shaves.
Morning, 007.
Good morning, Tanner.
He'll see you now.
? How's the arm, sir.
What? Oh, it's fine.
It'll get better.
All pretty shocking for

So, 007... Lots to be done.
Are you ready to
get back to work?
With pleasure, M.
With pleasure.
Where are you going?
I won't be long.
Welcome, Signor Sciarra.
I trust you had a pleasant journey.
Do you have it?
Yes. It's over there.
When do we blow the stadium?
This evening at six.
And the flight out of here?
All arranged.
And then what?
Then I visit The Pale King.
A toast, my friend.
To Death!
Bottoms up.
Meet me in the square!
I've been here before
But always hit the floor
I've spent a lifetime running
And I always get away
But with you
I'm feeling something
That makes me want to stay
If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?
How do I live?
How do I breathe?
When you're not here
I'm suffocating
I want to feel love
run through my blood
Tell me is this
where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all

A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid
If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

How do I breathe?

Start anywhere you like.
Take your time, 007,
but in five minutes
the head of
the Joint Security Service
is going to walk
through that door,
and I've got to explain to him
how one of our agents decided to
potter off to Mexico, all on his own,
and cause
an international incident.
With all due respect, sir,
it could've been worse.
Worse? You blew up
half a bloody block.
Well, better half a block than
a whole stadium full of people.
You had no authority.
None.
As you know,
we're in the middle of the biggest shakeup
in the history of
British intelligence.
The ink's barely dry
on this merger with MI5
and already they're itching
for a chance to scrap
the double-0 program forever.
And you've just given them one.
You're right, sir.
You have got a tricky day ahead.
This is an official question.
Mexico City.
What were you doing there?
It was just a coincidence.
I was taking some overdue holiday.
Okay. Fine.
As of this morning,
you are officially grounded.
I'm standing you down from
all operations indefinitely.
Very good, sir.
007?
Sir?
I don't know what
you're playing at,
but whatever it is,
it has to stop.
Now.
So sorry. Am I interrupting?
Not remotely.
007, I'd like you
to meet Max Denbigh,
head of the Joint
Security Service.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, 007.
I've heard a lot about you.
Most of it good.
Congratulations
on your new appointment.
Thank you.
I suppose we should
call you C now.
No, no. "Max," please.
No, I think I'll call you C,
C.
As you wish.
Well, my door is always open,
007, for my employees.
This merger's gonna be
a whole new chapter for us.
We're going to bring British
intelligence out of the Dark Ages
into the light.
That all sounds lovely.
That'll be all, 007. Report to Q
tomorrow for medical, thank you.
Very good, sir.
James?
Moneypenny.
So? How was
the meeting?
Very good, thank you.
Here.
Forensics finally released this.
What is it?
It's personal effects
they recovered from Skyfall.
Perfect. You can
bring it to me later.
What do you mean?
My place, 9:00.
Evening.
Come in.
Have you just moved in?
No.
Well,
I like what you've done with the place.
Your delivery.
Thank you.
Would you like a drink?
No, thanks.
I'm not staying.
That's a shame.
What's going on, James?
There's not one person at MI6
who isn't talking about it.
Talking about what, exactly?
That what you did in Mexico
was one step too far.
That you're finished.
And what do you think?
I think you're just
getting started.
I don't know what you mean.
All right.
I think you've got a secret.
And it's something
you won't tell anyone.
Because you don't trust anyone.
If anything happens to me, 007,
I need you to do something.
Find a man called Marco Sciarra.
Kill him.
And don't miss the funeral.
Jesus.
Where did you get it?
In my mailbox
just after she died.
Well, she was never
short of surprises.
She wasn't gonna let death
get in the way of her job.
I've been tracking
Sciarra ever since.
And what have you found?
Nothing significant yet.
When's the funeral?
Three days. In Rome.
If you think M's signing off on that,
you're insane.
He won't let you
out of his sight.
Yes, it's a bit of a problem.
Listen.
Could you do a little
quiet digging for me?
I heard a name in Mexico.
"The Pale King."
You want me to be your mole.
Yes.
And what makes you think
you can trust me?
Instinct.
Poor old girl.
Rigged for demolition in a week.
Cheaper to knock her down
than to rebuild.
Still.
Time waits for no man
and all that.
Anyway, all the money's
been spent on this,
the New Centre for
National Security.
So that's C's new digs.
You've met him, have you?
Yesterday.
What do we know about him?
Classic Whitehall mandarin.
Wrote a dossier last year
on how the double-0 program
was obsolete,
how drones could do
all our dirty work abroad.
Went to school with
the Home Secretary.
Of course, he did.
This merger's
just the start of it.
In three days,
there's a security conference in Tokyo
to decide the New World Order.
If C gets his way,
he'll have unlimited access
to the combined intelligence
streams of nine countries.
Including us.
Quite.
Well, a lot's happened
while you were away.
A train bombing in Hamburg and an
industrial explosion in Tunisia.
It's not great timing for us.
It's all rather
playing into C's hands.
M, well, let's say
he's feeling the pressure.
Yeah, I've noticed.
Now, this way, 007.
Be careful.
It's a trifle slippery.
Q wasn't exactly feeling
at home in Whitehall,
what with the new merger,
so he set up shop here,
away from prying eyes, as it were.
I hear he's got something
rather special planned for you.
I can hardly wait.
Ah, 007.
- Q.
- Please excuse the mess.
Everything's a little
bit up in the air,
what with the changes and all.
Couple of things to get through.
Shall we get started?
Just relax.
That's it. Lovely.
Now, you may feel a small...
Christ!
...prick.
What is it?
Cutting-edge
nanotechnology.
Smart Blood.
Microchips in your bloodstream.
Allows us to track
your movements in the field.
You see those readouts?
We can monitor your vital signs
from anywhere on the planet.
Well, that sounds marvelous.
Call it a post-Mexico
insurance policy.
By direct order of M.
I completely understand.
Good.
Right. Well, I've just, um,
got one last thing for you
and you can be on your way.
Magnificent, isn't she?
Zero to 60 in
three point two seconds.
Fully bulletproof.
A few little tricks up her sleeve.
It's a shame, really.
She was meant for you,
but she's been
reassigned to 009.
But you can have this.
Does it do anything?
It tells the time.
Might help with your
punctuality issues.
M's idea?
Precisely.
Oh, one word of warning.
The alarm is rather loud.
If you know what I mean.
I think I do.
Oh, yes. That old thing is
taking quite a bit of time.
Mind you, there wasn't
much left to work on.
Only a steering wheel.
I believe I said, "Bring it back in one
piece," not, "Bring back one piece."
Anyway, enjoy
your downtime, 007.
- Q?
- Yes?
Well, now you know exactly
where I am all of the time.
Will you do something for me?
What do you have
in mind, exactly?
Make me disappear.
May I remind you that
I answer directly to M.
I also have a mortgage.
And two cats to feed.
Well, then I suggest
you trust me,
for the sake of the cats.
Well, it's lovely to
see you, 007. Lovely.
Um, now, I meant to tell you,
the Smart Blood program is obviously
still in its developmental phase.
So we may experience the odd drop in
coverage during the first 24 hours...
48 hours after administration,
but after that it
should work perfectly.
I'll send you a postcard.
Please, don't.
Morning.
What's that?
Oh, it's just something from an admirer.
It's not your birthday, is it?
No, sir.
That was last week.
Morning.
009 has arrived to pick up the DB10, sir.
He's waiting upstairs.
Oh, good.
Yes, fine.
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry for your loss.
You knew my husband?
All too briefly.
What do you do?
Life insurance.
A little late for that.
For your husband, yes.
But what about you?
Me?
I hear the life expectancy of
some widows can be very short.
How can you talk like this?
Can't you see I'm grieving?
No.
What a lovely view.
You're wasting your time.
There are 100 more
that will come after me.
All you buy me is five minutes.
Excellent.
Time for a drink.
You killed him,
didn't you?
My husband.
He was an assassin.
Trust me, he won't
take it personally.
You signed my death warrant.
I was respected.
Loyal to a man you hated.
He trusted my silence.
With him gone, I'm a dead woman.
I can trust nobody.
I know the feeling well.
Well, I can tell you
that I don't trust you.
Well, then you have
impeccable instincts.
If you don't leave now,
we'll die together.
I can think of worse ways to go.
Then you're
obviously crazy, Mister...
Bond.
James Bond.
These people,
if you just knew
what they could do.
The power they have.
Did your husband ever mention
"The Pale King?"
No.
The organization,
they hardly ever meet.
But because of what
happened to my husband,
they meet tonight.
Why?
To choose a replacement.
Where?
The Palazzo Cardenza.
Midnight.
Sounds like fun.
I might drop by.
He was obsessed.
He spent more time
with them than with me.
Then the man was a fool.
Leaving your number?
I've called an American friend of mine.
Felix.
He'll contact his embassy
and get you out of here.
You'll be safe.
Don't go, James.
If you go there,
you're crossing over to a
place where there is no mercy.
I have to go.
Identify yourself, asshole.
Who are you?
I'm Mickey Mouse. Who are you?
...pharmacy sites
has provided
an excellent new sales platform.
We have adapted many of them into
clearinghouses for unapproved drugs.
In addition to which,
the latest figures show
that we presently control
70% of antimalarial vaccines,
34% of H.I.V.,
and 40% of all oncological drugs
across Sub-Saharan Africa.
But we face challenges
from the WHO
in their campaign against our
counterfeit pharmaceuticals.
We have now identified the
key individuals to target.
We expect the same
success as we had
against the Council
on Human Trafficking.
Since the board's resignation...
..we have placed 160,000 migrated females
into the leisure sector.
The impending completion of
the Global Surveillance initiative...
...will mean our capability
is second to none...
...and now is the moment
for aggressive expansion.
The news is only good...
Don't let me interrupt you.
The news is only good...
Our increased surveillance capability...
...means government
intelligence agencies...
...are easily counteracted.
We are winning.
Thank you, Doctor.
Now, on to the matter at hand.
After the success of our
attacks in Hamburg and Tunisia,
the aborted attack
in Mexico City
and the death of our valued colleague,
Marco Sciarra,
leaves one of his duties
outstanding.
Signor Guerra,
The Pale King must be terminated.
Will you make
the journey to Altaussee?
Of course.
My loyalty to this organization is total.
I will protect it with my last breath.
There will be no more...
...amateurs.
No more shows of weakness.
Does anyone challenge Signor
Guerra for this position?
Welcome.
State your credentials for
succeeding Signor Sciarra.
It's funny.
All that excitement in Mexico
City rang a distant bell.
And now,
suddenly, this evening,
it makes perfect sense.
Welcome, James.
It's been a long time.
But, finally, here we are.
What took you so long?
Cuckoo.
Ciao, Mickey Mouse.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
No.
Moneypenny.
Bond?
Listen, Moneypenny.
Hamburg, Tunisia,
Mexico City, they're all linked.
It's one organization
coordinating multiple attacks.
So, she was right.
Of course, she was.
- I ran that check.
- Who is it?
Oh, my boss had his
credit card stolen.
It's nothing.
Why don't you go back to sleep.
Don't be long.
- Who was that?
- No one.
No, it wasn't.
It's just a friend.
At this time of night?
It's called life, James.
You should try it sometime.
The Pale King. It looks like
you've had dealings with him before.
Quantum.
Of course.
Mr. White!
That's him.
Last unconfirmed sighting,
Altaussee in Austria, four months ago.
Hold that thought.
You still there?
Yeah.
Run another name, will you?
Okay. Go.
A man called
Franz Oberhauser. He's...
And check his files
before and after his death.
After his death?
What are you talking about?
Please, just do it.
Okay, Q, give me something.
That's more like it.
Here goes nothing.
Good evening.
Do not let them tell you
we need less surveillance.
We need more. Much more.
I say again, the Nine Eyes
committee would have full access
to the combined intelligence
streams of all member states.
More data, more analysis,
less likelihood of
a terrorist attack.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for the security
services of the world to unite.
Alone, we are weak.
Together, we're a global power.
An unelected one.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We will now vote
on the resolution.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please cast your vote.
The vote is eight
to one in favor.
However, as you know,
we cannot proceed
unless by unanimous vote.
The Nine Eyes motion
is therefore not passed.
Democracy.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
This evening's session is adjourned.
Yes, sir.
Please, tell me 007
is in London.
Oh, yes.
Um, I'll just take
a look now, sir.
Because if he isn't,
you're in deep shit.
You've got precisely 10 seconds.
I have him, sir.
He appears to be in Chelsea.
Well, I want eyes on him
when I get back, understood?
I completely understand,
sir.
Do me a favor.
Make it quick.
Upstairs, Mr. White.
I always knew death would
wear a familiar face,
but not yours.
To what do I owe
this pleasure, Mr. Bond?
I was at a meeting recently
and your name came up.
I'm flattered London is
still talking about me.
It wasn't MI6.
It was Rome.
Your team, not mine.
Ah.
Last month,
I found thallium in my cell phone.
It's done its job.
I have a few weeks. Maybe less.
So, here we are, Mr. Bond,
two dead men
enjoying the evening.
What did you do?
I disobeyed him.
I followed him
as far as I could.
He changed.
Oh, I see.
You grew a conscience.
Our game is our game.
But this?
Women, children...
Well, the thallium would suggest
that he doesn't like you
very much anymore.
And clearly
the feeling is mutual.
So why don't you tell me
how to find him again?
Oh, come on.
Tell me where he is.
He's everywhere.
Everywhere!
He's sitting at your desk,
he's kissing your lover,
he's eating supper with your family!
You're protecting someone.
Your wife.
She left long ago.
Your son?
Your daughter.
You won't find her.
She's clever.
She's smarter than me.
She knows how to hide.
I can protect her if
you tell me where he is.
I can keep her alive.
Yeah.
You have my word.
Your word?
The word of an assassin!
That's my word.
L'Amricain.
You save her,
she can lead you to L'Amricain.
She knows L'Amricain.
Try the Hoffler Klinik.
You're a kite dancing in a hurricane,
Mr. Bond.
So long.
I can't deny I'm impressed you
got H.M.G. to cough up for all this.
Good God, the government couldn't
afford this kind of facility.
No, it was benefactors mostly,
from the private sector.
When it goes online,
this building will be
the most sophisticated
data gathering system
in history.
The world's digital ghost,
available 24/7.
George Orwell's worst nightmare.
I'm glad you like it.
My commiserations
on losing the Nine Eyes vote.
Must have been a blow.
Not really.
Only a matter of time
before the South Africans
see the light.
And you know what they say,
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Day and a half maybe.
Look, Max,
I know surveillance is a fact of life.
It's how you use the
information that concerns me,
and who is using it.
This is what we need to do
to keep the people safe.
Double-0 program
is prehistoric.
Come on, M. You can't really tell
me that one man in the field
can compete with all of this,
running around out there
with his license to kill.
Have you ever had
to kill a man, Max?
Have you?
To pull that trigger,
you have to be sure.
Yes, you investigate,
analyze, assess, target.
And then you have
to look him in the eye.
And you make the call.
And all the drones, bugs,
cameras, transcripts,
all the surveillance
in the world
can't tell you what to do next.
A license to kill
is also a license not to kill.
I didn't want to
have to do this,
but it looks like you still
can't control your agents.
Bond? I ran that check.
Looks like you've had dealings
with him before. Quantum.
Of course. Mr. White!
Last unconfirmed sighting,
Altaussee in Austria.
Run another name, will you?
So maybe there's
something to be said
for total surveillance
after all.
You watch MI6 agents?
We watch everyone.
Please, take a seat.
I'll be with you
in just a moment.
Please excuse me,
Mr. Bond.
My name is
Dr. Madeleine Swann.
Our job today is to
analyze your needs,
both psychological and physical.
Hmm, sounds pretty
straightforward.
I hope you don't mind.
The view can be distracting.
I hadn't noticed.
I see you filled out
most of the paperwork.
Just a few questions to complete
your evaluation, if I may.
Do you exercise?
When I have to.
Do you consider your employment
to be psychologically stressful?
Sometimes.
How much alcohol do you consume?
Too much.
Some broader questions.
As a child, would you say you
were close to your parents?
My parents died
when I was young.
Really? How old?
Old enough to remember.
How, if I may ask?
It was a climbing accident.
So who brought you up?
Someone else.
Humor me.
How does one train at Oxford and
the Sorbonne become a consultant,
spend two years with
Mdecins Sans Frontires
and end up here?
Forgive me,
but anyone might think
you were hiding from something.
You're paying a lot of money to be here,
Mr. Bond.
Who's asking the questions,
you or me?
Of course. Carry on.
I see you left this
final question blank.
What is your occupation?
Well, that's not the sort of
thing that looks good on a form.
And why is that?
I kill people.
Small world?
Where is he?
Your father's dead.
Two days ago.
How do you know?
Because I was there.
Did you kill him?
I didn't have to.
He did it himself.
And you came all the way
just to tell me this?
That my father's dead?
I came to tell you that your life
is in danger and I need your help.
Why?
I made a deal with him to protect you.
You're lying.
Why would he trust you?
Because he knew that I
needed something in return.
And what was that?
To find L'Amricain.
This interview is over.
Dr. Swann...
You have 10 minutes to leave the building.
Then I'm calling security.
Thank you,
Dr. Swann.
Can I get you something, sir?
Vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.
I'm sorry,
we don't serve alcohol.
I'm really starting
to love this place.
He'll have the prolytic
digestive enzyme shake.
Certainly.
If you've come for the car,
I parked it
at the bottom of the Tiber.
Well, not to worry, 007.
It was only a 3,000,000 prototype.
Why are you here, Q?
Oh, I just fancied a break,
to be honest.
I've been a tad stressed
at work recently.
What with C's people
crawling all over us
and the fact that M wants my
balls for Christmas decorations.
Get to the point.
The point, 007,
is that Franz Oberhauser
is dead.
Dead and buried.
And unless you come back
with me right now,
my career and Moneypenny's
will go the same way.
Do you understand?
All hell is breaking loose out there and...
I saw him.
You thought you saw him.
We've been through the records.
He died in an avalanche
with his father 20 years ago.
Yes. I know that.
But I saw him.
He's not someone
I'll ever forget.
So you have a lead?
I have a name.
L'Amricain.
Well, that narrows it down.
Look, I'm sorry, 007,
but time's up.
My whole career
is on the line here.
Either you come back in and do
this through proper channels,
or I go directly to M.
Do one more thing for me.
Then you're out.
Find out what you can from this.
I really, really
hate you right now.
Thank you, Q.
Monsieur?
Now? Please?
Where are you staying?
The Pevsner. Room 12.
One hour.
Here you are, sir.
One prolytic digestive enzyme shake.
Do me a favor, will you?
Throw that down the toilet.
Cut out the middleman.
No! Stay.
What do you want?
What are you doing?
Can't any of you speak?
Come on!
Argh, don't touch me!
Hey!
You need to take a breath and calm down.
You're in shock.
Get away from me!
Just get away!
Did it cross your mind
that you led them to me?
I haven't got time for this.
You need to tell me everything
you know about L'Amricain.
Go to hell!
I gave your father my word!
And why should I trust you?
Because my father did?
Because right now,
Dr. Swann,
I'm your best chance
of staying alive.
Dr. Swann, Q.
Q, Dr. Swann.
Hello.
Enchanted.
Bond, we need
to talk. Alone.
She knows.
But, Bond...
She knows.
What have you got?
I owe you an apology, 007.
You are onto something.
Oberhauser is still alive.
The ring proves it.
And it seems they were
all part of one organization.
Le Chiffre, Quantum, Sciarra,
your friend Mr. Silva.
And do you know
who links them all?
Him.
Exactly.
This organization,
do you know what it's called?
- No.
- Spectre.
Its name is Spectre.
How does she know that?
Because my father
was part of it.
Then I think that
you ought to see this.
You're looking at pictures
from South Africa right now
of what appears to be
a huge explosion.
Q, go back to London.
M's gonna need your help.
And keep tracking me.
I will.
And, Bond, you have
to find L'Amricain.
He's our only link
to Oberhauser.
It's not a person.
It's a place.
Thank you.
This is where they spent
their wedding night.
They came back every year.
Then they brought me
with them, too.
He kept coming back,
even after the divorce.
Well, then I'm sorry.
What for?
Ah-ha!
What is it?
It's your inheritance.
Want some?
No, thank you.
You don't know
what you're missing.
This can't be it.
Well, here's to your father.
I promised myself I would never
be hurt by that man again.
I cut off all contact.
I didn't want anything to do
with him or his sick life.
And then, with his dying breath
he sends me you.
Ironic, no?
You shouldn't be so hard on him.
The man I just met should
have been dead weeks ago.
The only reason his heart
was still beating was you.
I'll mourn my father
in my own time, Mr. Bond.
And, now, I'm going to bed.
Oh.
Don't think for one moment this
is where I fall into your arms,
seeking solace
for my dead daddy.
You sit there.
Keep watch.
That's what you're good at.
Come anywhere near me
and I'll kill you.
I don't doubt it.
Look. There are two of you.
Two Jameses.
Lucky me.
What am I doing here?
To liars...
...and killers.
To liars...
...and killers...
...everywhere.
Who sent you?
Who are you working for?
Now, where did you go?
Of course.
What is it?
Nothing.
What's this?
It's coordinates.
Your father was scanning for
a particular satellite phone.
He was looking for someone.
He was looking for him.
And he sent me here
to finish the job.
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.
I like you alive.
I can look after myself.
That's beside the point.
I might not be coming back.
I know.
But I want to understand
what happened to my father.
So, where was he going?
Nowhere.
Thank you so much. Thanks.
All the very best.
What's going on?
The meeting was brought forward.
Did you not get the message?
No, we didn't.
Shortest meeting I can remember.
South Africans on board,
I take it?
Yeah, well, who can blame them?
Nine Eyes is now
officially sanctioned.
The new system goes live
in less than 72 hours.
It's a major step forward.
Global intelligence cooperation
changes everything.
As you said before.
Look.
They've asked me
to head the new committee.
Yes? And?
And I should tell you I've
spoken with the Home Secretary.
And in light of the new
information I've given him,
he's decided to close down the double-0
program with immediate effect.
You don't know
what you're doing.
It's not personal.
It's the future.
And...
You're not.
You're a cocky little bastard,
aren't you?
I'll take that as a compliment.
I wouldn't.
This isn't over yet.
Would you press this for me?
Thank you. Yes, sir.
Pick it up.
I hate guns.
I promised him I'd protect you.
The first thing to do is to teach
you how to protect yourself.
What if I shoot you by mistake?
Wouldn't be the first time.
Pick it up.
I said, I hate guns.
SIG 226.
Front sight.
Rear sight. Hammer.
You just point it.
You squeeze the trigger.
You try not to close your eyes.
Please, try it.
I don't have to
teach you anything, do I?
A man once came to our house
to kill my father.
He didn't know I was upstairs
playing in my bedroom.
Or that Papa kept
a Beretta Nine-millimeter
under the sink with the bleach.
That's why I hate guns.
I think we'll skip
hand-to-hand combat.
Good evening, sir.
Sorry to interrupt your supper,
but we have some news.
Evening, sir.
Using the Smart Blood,
I've tracked Bond
to a point here in North Africa.
See, every known map
registers it as empty desert.
Exactly. But if you look at the satellite
blowup, you can clearly see this.
We can't help him.
But, sir, we know
where he's heading.
C is watching everything we do.
We're only handing them
more information.
Sir, we can't just desert Bond.
We have to.
We only make him weaker.
But, sir,
we know exactly where he is.
Yes, I know, but if we can track him,
so can others.
Delete all
the Smart Blood files.
Everything.
He's on his own.
You shouldn't stare.
Well, you shouldn't
look like that.
May I get you an apritif?
I'm not sure.
It gets me into trouble.
Makes me do crazy things.
Well, we can't have that.
So, I'll have
a vodka martini, dirty.
Make that two.
I have a question.
Well, what's that?
Why, given every
other possible option,
does a man choose the
life of a paid assassin?
Well, it was that
or the priesthood.
I'm serious.
Is this really what you want?
Living in the shadows?
Hunting? Being hunted?
Always looking behind you?
Always alone?
But I'm not alone.
Answer the question.
I'm not sure I ever
had a choice.
Anyway, I don't stop
to think about it.
What would happen if you did?
Stop?
Yes.
I don't know.
Your drinks, sir.
Could you leave
them there, please.
You know, I think you're wrong.
I am?
We always have a choice.
I'll drink to that.
Shit.
What do we do now?
This might be a long wait.
Are you having second thoughts?
Too late now.
What's that?
That is a 1948 Rolls-Royce
Silver Wraith.
Please.
I'm scared, James.
Good afternoon,
Mr. Bond, Dr. Swann.
I want you to know just how excited
we all are to finally meet you.
Well,
it's a pleasure to be here.
Your host invites
you both to rest,
relax, and join him
for drinks at 4:00.
- Tell our host we won't be late.
- Wonderful.
Before we show you to your rooms,
just one more thing.
Oh.
You be careful with that.
It's loaded.
Thank you.
This is a very special place.
He has requested
you enter it alone.
Of course.
Champagne?
Maybe later.
Certainly.
I think
we're meant to be impressed.
Touch it.
You can touch it if you want.
Do you know what it is?
It's a meteorite.
Yes, exactly.
The Kartenhoff.
The oldest in human possession.
The very meteorite
which made this crater.
Think about it.
So many years up there,
alone, silent,
building momentum until it chose
to make its mark on Earth.
A huge, unstoppable force.
Except it did stop, didn't it?
Right here.
I can't tell you how much I've
been looking forward to this.
All of us here, together.
A reunion.
I'm so glad you came,
too, dear Madeleine.
You were just a girl
when I saw you first.
I came to your home once
to see your father.
I don't remember that.
But I do.
Shall we?
What is this place?
Information.
Information is all,
is it not?
For example,
you must know by now that the
double-0 program is officially dead.
Which leads me to
speculate exactly why you came.
So, James, why did you come?
I came here to kill you.
And I thought you
came here to die.
Well, it's all
a matter of perspective.
Speaking of perspective.
Is this live?
Live and direct. 16:20 GMT.
What an uncanny coincidence.
The French have a saying,
"It's the fate of glass to break."
Well, maybe it's the fate
of spies to just disappear.
But with any luck,
we leave something behind.
In the meantime,
I'm sure C will keep you all busy.
Thank you all.
That's touching,
don't you think?
Well, James,
it looks like you're all alone.
Not much more than a voyeur,
are you?
Too scared to join in.
I don't think
you quite understand.
Oh, I think I do.
You set cities on fire and
watch innocent people burn,
so you can convince
governments to join
an intelligence network
you've paid for.
Not that complicated.
I'm guessing our little friend,
C, he's one of your disciples.
You could say that.
And what does he get out of it?
Nothing.
He's a visionary, like me.
Visionaries.
Psychiatric wards
are full of them.
Whereas you couldn't see
what's right in front of you.
You came across me so many
times and yet you never saw me.
Le Chiffre, Greene, Silva.
All dead.
Yeah, that's right.
A nice pattern developed.
You interfered in my world,
I destroyed yours.
Or did you think
it was coincidence
that all the women in
your life ended up dead?
Vesper Lynd, for example.
She was the big one.
Has he told you about her?
And then, of course,
your beloved M.
Gone forever.
Me.
It was all me, James.
It's always been me.
The author of all your pain.
You're a brave woman, my dear.
Now I understand why
my father lost his mind.
He didn't lose his mind,
he was just weak.
But at least he understood
what he was up against.
You see,
they failed to comprehend the crucial fact,
that a terrible event can
lead to something wonderful.
Since you mention your father,
I'll show you.
She's clever.
She's smarter than me.
She knows how to hide.
I can protect her if you
tell me where he is.
I can keep her alive.
Yeah.
You have my word.
No, no, no. Turn this off.
Your word?
The word of an assassin!
Turn this off.
This is important.
I said turn it off!
I want you to
understand something.
That's my word.
Madeleine?
Look at me.
Don't look at him,
Madeleine. Look at me.
L'Amricain.
You save her,
she can lead you to L'Amricain.
She knows L'Amricain.
Try the Hoffler Klinik.
You're a kite dancing in a hurricane,
Mr. Bond.
So long.
The things that
bring people together.
Out of horror, beauty.
Torture is easy,
on a superficial level.
A man can watch himself
being disemboweled
and derive great horror
from the experience,
but it's still
going on at a distance.
It isn't taking
place where he is.
As you know all too well, dear Madeleine,
a man lives inside his head.
That's where
the seat of his soul is.
Now, James and I were
both present recently
when a man was
deprived of his eyes.
And the most
astonishing thing happened.
Didn't you notice?
He wasn't there anymore.
He'd gone even though
he was still alive.
So in this brief moment
between life and death,
there was nobody
inside his skull.
Most odd.
So, James.
I'm going to penetrate
to where you are.
To the inside of your head.
Now, the first probe
will play with your sight,
your hearing
and your balance,
just with the subtlest
of manipulations.
Well, get on with it then.
Nothing can be as painful
as listening to you talk.
All right.
Let's begin.
Why are you doing this?
You probably know
that James here
lost his parents
when he was young.
But did you know
that it was my father
who helped him through
this difficult time?
Over the course of two winters
he taught him to ski,
and climb, and hunt.
He soothed the wounds of the
poor little blue-eyed orphan.
Asked me to treat
him as a brother.
My little brother.
They formed quite an attachment.
So,
you killed him.
Yes, I did.
You know what happens
when a cuckoo
hatches inside
another bird's nest?
Yes.
It forces the other eggs out.
Yes.
Well, this cuckoo made me realize
my father's life had to end.
In a way, he's responsible
for the path I took.
- So, thank you.
- Cuckoo.
Do you know any other
birdcalls, Franz?
Hello, pussy.
Franz Oberhauser died
20 years ago, James.
In an avalanche,
alongside his father.
The man you are talking to now,
the man inside your head,
is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
Catchy name.
My mother's bloodline.
If the needle finds the correct
spot in the fusiform gyrus,
you'll recognize no one.
Of course,
the faces of your women
are interchangeable,
aren't they, James?
You won't know who she is.
Just another passing face
on your way to the grave.
He dies not knowing who you are.
The daughter of an assassin.
The only one who could
have understood him.
Shame.
I love you.
Do those blue eyes
still recognize you?
I'd recognize you anywhere.
The watch.
One minute.
One minute.
Did he say something?
Tempus fugit.
- What?
- Tempus fugit.
I can't hear you, James.
I said,
doesn't time fly?
In there!
Let's go home.
It's not over yet.
I've never even
heard of Hildebrand.
That is the general
idea with safe houses.
Exactly how safe is this, sir?
We're about to find out.
It's safe.
Better wait here.
I'm M.
Madeleine Swann.
Pleased to meet you.
So, what do you
have for me, 007?
The recently deceased head of Spectre,
Ernst Stavro Blofeld,
and his chief of intelligence,
your new best friend, C.
About to take control of his very
own global surveillance system
that he built right
here under our noses.
Then we'd better move.
The system goes online at midnight.
If that happens,
Spectre will have control of everything.
So, you and I will
have a quiet word with C
while Q hacks into the system
and stops it going online.
It won't be easy.
He'll find a way.
He always does.
It's good to have you back, 007.
Sir.
James, I can't.
I'll come back for you
when it's all over.
No, I can't.
No, you can't
stay here, or you...
I can't go back to this life.
And I'm not going to ask you to change.
This is who you are.
You're saying good-bye.
Yes.
Take care.
You're a good man, James.
Are you in yet, Q?
A few layers of impenetrable
security still to go,
but I think
I'm getting somewhere.
They've seen us! Reverse!
Go!
Get him in the building!
Move. Move!
Go back and find M, now!
We need them both.
Not a good feeling
being watched, is it?
Don't tell me you're
responsible for this.
No, but my Quartermaster is.
And he's extremely talented.
Well, bravo.
But in case you hadn't realized it,
you two are out of a job.
So you're trespassing.
I'm afraid you've got the
wrong end of the stick, Max.
We're going to stop this
system going online.
And then I'm going
to bring you in.
On what grounds exactly?
Poor taste in friends.
Take a look at the world.
Chaos.
Because people like you,
paper-pushers
and politicians,
are too spineless to do
what needs to be done.
So I made an alliance to put
the power where it should be.
And now you want to throw it away
for the sake of "democracy."
Whatever the hell that is.
How predictably moronic.
But then isn't that
what M stands for?
"Moron."
And now we know
what C stands for.
"Careless."
Come on.
No, no, no!
You're a hard man
to kill, Blofeld.
Ouch.
I do hope that
doesn't hurt too much.
My wounds will heal.
What about yours?
Look around you,
James. Look.
This is what's
left of your world.
Everything you ever stood for,
everything you believed in, a ruin.
Why are we here?
Did you miss me?
No.
But I know someone who does.
Where is she?
That's for you to find out.
In three minutes,
this building will be demolished.
I can get out easily.
Now, you have a choice.
Die trying to save her or
save yourself and
live with the pain.
You're bluffing.
Am I?
I've really put you through it,
haven't I?
That's brothers for you.
They always know
which buttons to press.
Madeleine!
Come on.
Come on.
Yes!
Let's go.
After you.
Why can't you just face it, M?
You don't matter anymore.
Maybe I don't.
But something has to.
Dead.
- Any word on Bond?
- No.
But I can hazard a guess.
Madeleine!
Madeleine!
Do you trust me?
Do I have a choice?
Not anymore.
Come on!
Good-bye, James Bond.
Brace, brace, brace!
Sir, this is a terrorist alert.
Mallory, double-0 section.
Stand them down.
Echo team, hold fire.
Stand down.
Finish it.
Finish it.
Out of bullets.
And besides,
I've got something better to do.
Under the Special
Measures Act of 2001,
I am detaining you on behalf
of Her Majesty's Government.
Bond?
What are you doing here?
Good morning, Q.
I thought you'd gone.
I have.
There's just one thing I need.
Madeleine?
You want to eat again?
You eat too much because you're depressed.
Madeleine!
Yes?
Madeleine!
Yes, Mama?
I'm thirsty, my angel.
I'm coming.
Do you want your medicine?
Yes, my darling.
Do you want to play a game?
I'm waiting for Papa to come home.
What do you think Papa does?
He's a doctor.
He heals people.
Your papa, he kills people.
Non.
Is that who you love? Murderers?
Maman.
Maman.
Maman. Maman.
Leave me be. Go play.
Maman!
Leave me alone!
Maman!
Is Mr. White home?
No. He's gone.
My name is Lyutsifer Safin.
Your husband killed my family.
I told you, he's gone.
I know. This will hurt him more.
You okay?
Yes.
Let's go.
How's the view?
It's growing on me.
Can you go faster?
We don't need to go faster.
We have all the time in the world.
- Buonasera, signore.
- Buonasera.
You can't help
looking over your shoulder.
- What?
- No one is coming.
- I wasn't looking over my shoulder.
- Yes, you were.
No. Are we going to
have a row about this?
What are they burning?
Secrets. Wishes.
Letting go of the past.
Getting rid of old things,
in come the new.
Je taime.
Je taime.
Where did you go to?
Today, by the water. Hmm?
Tell me.
I'll tell you
if you tell me about Vesper.
Is that why we're here?
- She's buried at the acropolis.
- I know where she's buried.
Can you forgive her? For us?
I left her behind a long time ago.
As long as we're looking over
our shoulder, the past is not dead.
You have to let her go,
even if it's hard.
You mean, um,
if we're to have a future?
Mm-hmm.
So, I do this, and then...
I'll tell you all my secrets.
Okay.
I'm going to go and do this,
and then I'm going to come back
for breakfast.
Thank you.
And then you're going to tell me
where we're going next.
Home.
Buongiorno.
I miss you.
Madeleine?
Madeleine?
Blofeld sends his regards.
You know...
Madeleine,
she is a daughter of Spectre.
She's a daughter of Spectre.
Your baggage is already down,
Mr. Bond.
As your wife requested.
You were right.
Letting go is hard.
James.
What happened?
What happened?
How did they know I was here?
- What are you talking about?
- Madeleine, how did they know I was here?
- I have no idea what you're...
- Spectre. How did they know?
What are you talking about?
James!
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
We're leaving.
There is something
I need to tell you.
I bet there is.
James!
Pick it up. Pick it up!
If's Blofeld, my love.
Your father would be so proud of you.
Your sacrifice will be our glory.
- I don't understand.
- Bravo.
Hello?
- Let the sheep out, kid.
- Why?
Because otherwise I'll kill you.
James, why?
Why would I betray you?
We all have our secrets.
We just didn't get to yours yet.
James. James, listen to me.
I'd rather die
than you think I'm tr...
James!
James!
Do something. James!
Say something, James!
Please.
Okay.
Come on.
So...
this is it?
This is it.
How will I know that you're okay?
You won't.
You'll never see me again.
I should've known
I'd leave alone
Just goes fo show
That the blood you bleed
Is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life
But life is far away from fair
Was I stupid fo love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious fo everybody else
That I'd fallen for a lie?
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time fo die
let it bun
You're no longer my concern
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time fo die
No time fo die
No time fo die
We're in.
Proceed.
Please remember to back up
all data by 10:00 p.m. this evening
aue to planned server maintenance.
You okay?
You know the SL5, the weaponized smallpox
I was using this morning?
Have you seen it?
I- I put it in the bloody...
Valdo, you haven't seen
a tub of smallpox, have you?
This was a good soup,
now it is waste,
even if it is joke.
Idiot.
There is more complexity
in my tomato soup
than in both of your brains combined.
Valdo, that is so unkind. It's so...
One day I will put Ebola
in your tea.
And then I will watch
as your faces sweat blood,
and I will be laughing.
- Nice. Keep your hair on.
- Wow.
He's got a terrifying imagination,
hasn't he?
Dr. Obruchev.
They are coming.
Who?
Spectre.
Safin.
Do not try to stop them.
This is what
we've been waiting for.
They will ask you to enter Bio Security
Level-4 fridge and remove the weapon.
No one must see what you are doing.
They will not kill you.
They think they need you.
They will not kill me?
Transferring the files
as we speak.
Now... Now it's done.
What do I do with it?
Swallow it. Goodbye.
Swallow the...
Yes, I like animals!
Bye-bye.
For goodness' sake!
Danger. Illegal access detected.
Secure all biohazardous materials
immediately.
Move! Follow!
No! No!
Caution. Unauthorized
personnel located in this sector.
Please, we're scientists.
We're unarmed.
We're unarmed. What do you want?
Valdo Obruchev.
Uh-huh. Hello.
Open the Bio Security Level-4 fridge.
- And...
- Give me the weapon.
What weapon?
We have...
Heracles.
- It requires double authentication.
- Which one?
Him.
Hardy. Hardy! Don't let them.
Don't let them.
Don't let them, please.
No!
Warning, facility lockdown in progress.
All exits are now sealed.
Warning, facility lockdown in progress.
All exits are now sealed.
Oh, what is...
It's a safety belt? This?
Wow.
I- l cannot.
There is no elevator!
Magnets.
Sir, I've just received
the most unusual...
I've seen it.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Sir, what's the Heracles project?
This lab isn't on the books.
No, it's not.
- There were casualties.
- It was a gas leak.
Shall I alert the PM?
It was a gas leak. I'll handle it.
Moneypenny.
Where's 0077?
Well, isn't this a surprise, Felix?
James.
Who's the blond?
Logan Ash, State Department.
It's really nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.
I mean, I'm a huge fan.
- Babylon.
- Police boy.
I need a favor, brother.
You didn't get the memo?
I'm retired.
I wouldn't ask if you were still
in Her Majesty's Service.
And what does that mean?
Our elected leaders aren't playing nice
in the sandbox.
James.
Is there somewhere quiet
where we can talk in private?
Quiet? Yeah.
I was hoping
you could pick up a package.
- Five.
- Four.
Where's the package?
Short trip. Cuba.
You love it there.
Oh, I love it there?
Valdo Obruchev.
You're gonna say
you never heard of him.
Never heard of him.
- Two.
- Three.
Ah.
It's a good life.
You never heard of him? Didn't he defect
during your tenure at MI6?
Obruchev was kidnapped three days ago
from a secret MI6 lab in London.
Two days ago, his mug pinged
on a facial-recognition sweep
in Santiago de Cuba.
He's leaving out the best part.
Spectre.
I have a contact there,
says they're gathering.
Coincidence?
Come on. It'll be like old times.
- Three.
- Two.
You're really
the only guy for the job.
You're the guy.
It's my round.
Hi.
- Scotch.
- Yeah, man.
Where'd you find
the Book of Mormon?
Political appointee.
Not my choice.
Seems intelligence
isn't central anymore.
He smiles too much.
Help us get this
into the right hands.
- What, and you're the right hands?
- I'm not just a pretty face.
I stopped trusting pretty faces
a long time ago, Felix.
Yeah, I heard. Bad luck.
- Bad judgment.
- Yeah.
Harder to tell the good from bad,
villains from heroes these days.
I need you, James.
You're the only one I trust with this.
I'm not screwing around.
I wanna get back to my family,
tell them I saved the world again.
Don't you?
Nice to see you again, Felix.
- At least take my number.
- I've got your number.
In trouble?
Constantly.
Need a ride?
Sure. Why not?
Hold on.
- What's your name?
- Nomi.
- Yours?
- James. Call me James.
- What do you do, Nomi?
- I'm a diver.
What do you dive for?
I have a thing for old wrecks.
Well, then you've come
to the right place.
After you.
Hmm.
Nice house.
Thank you.
Is that the bedroom?
Yes, itis.
Well, that's not the first thing
I thought you'd take off, but...
Yeah.
You seem like a man
who's gagging for some action, Mr. Bond.
Shall we cut to the chase?
- I'm here as a professional courtesy.
- Well, you're not very courteous, are you?
You've broken my car...
It's Commander Bond,
but you know that.
Double-07?
- Two years.
- Very young.
- High achiever.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
The world's moved on since you retired,
Commander Bond.
- Perhaps you didn't notice.
- No, can't say I had.
And in my humble opinion,
the world doesn't change very much.
You would say that.
Look, this all seems like heaven,
this little bubble or whatever.
But it's so obvious
you're a man who only has time to Kill,
nothing to live for.
So, Valdo Obruchev is off-limits.
You get in my way,
I will put a bullet in your knee.
The one that works.
You need to ask yourself
a few more questions.
MI6, CIA chasing after the same man,
not communicating with each other,
that's not good.
- Mmm.
- You know what?
Tell M hello, but...
I don't work for him anymore.
Tell him yourself.
By the way,
I'm not just any old double-0.
I'm 007.
You probably thought
they'd retire it.
It's just a number.
Yeah.
See you in Cuba?
How's it going, Q7?
Several large files seem to have been
wiped from Obruchev's hard drive.
He was working on
some pretty advanced algorithm...
Can you retrieve the files?
Trying.
Get me everything you can
and then destroy the drive.
If I knew more about
what this was, I could...
Thank you, Q. That's all.
Yes. One minute.
The PM is calling again.
007. Tell them something.
Anything.
M, darling. Couple of things.
- Bond.
- I met your new 007.
She's a disarming young woman.
So, Obruchev.
You kept him on the payroll, didn't you?
Stay out of it.
This has nothing to do with you.
It does. It's Spectre.
Mallory...
what have you done?
- Double-0 trouble?
- The CIA have the advantage.
Get me Blofeld.
Sir, he only speaks
to his psychiatrist.
I know.
The live feed's what I want.
They stay straight in the middle.
And then they bring him up.
He's like this every day,
mad as a bag of bees.
- It's crowning day.
- Good.
What is it?
It's nothing.
It's clean. It's clean as can be.
Everyone just wants a party.
Yeah, I want them both fo hear me.
Itll be a surprise.
Felix...
I'm in.
He's in.
There's a young lady in Santiago
I want you to meet.
Paloma?
- You're late.
- L...
Vamos.
Um, something about a hat?
Paris, uh...
Huh? What hat?
I forget things
when I get nervous.
This is the biggest job
I've ever had. Come.
This your room?
It's a wine cellar.
Okay, come here.
Don't you think we ought to get to know
each other just a little bit before we...
Oh!
No, no, no, no.
Um, no, I'm sorry.
- All right.
- You do it.
Thank you.
Do you mind?
This is going to go brilliantly.
I know.
I've done three weeks' training.
- Que?
- Let's get a drink.
Good idea.
Two vodka martinis,
shaken, not stirred.
SJ, senor.
So I can hear you.
What shall we drink to?
Felix?
To Felix.
Remind me to get him a cigar.
Vamos?
- Sure.
- Okay.
Will this sample
be enough for you?
If he has used it, yes.
It is now progressing.
Oops. Sorry.
Terrible, terrible gloves.
So slippery.
Forgive me.
How much longer?
Aha!
To happy new future for Spectre.
Now it is ready.
You go that way.
I'll go this way.
What is this?
Spectre bunga bunga?
You ever been to a party like this?
How do you think I got this job?
Don't get distracted, now.
Remember, we're looking
for our Russian scientist.
I'm seeing a lot of Spectre agents.
Yes.
And it looks like all of them.
Wow.
Friend of yours?
Cyclops.
We ran into each other in Italy.
That was an eye-opening experience.
They're wearing earpieces.
Scanning.
It'll be all clear.
It'll be clean.
It's good. It's as good as can be.
- It's my party.
- Ah. Found it.
Celebrate me, my birthday,
my crowning day.
Who's the birthday boy?
Um, Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
Is he here?
- No, he's...
- Make your way.
Follow the music.
He's in London in prison.
How do you know for sure?
Because I put him there.
Feel my warm embrace.
Experience a delicious surprise.
Let us shepherd humanity
with our new power.
I've spotted him,
our little Russian scientist.
Have you got him?
- I got him.
- Stay with him.
But I see you from my little eye,
and my little eye says hi.
Now, see, now...
we emerge from the shadows
as gods on Mount Olympus.
Here's fo the end of our pariah.
Oh, my burden, my brother...
James Bond.
Goodbye, James.
You're popular tonight.
You can't run. It's too late.
It's already crawling under your skin.
Don't be alarmed. It's harmless fo us.
Just to him. So delicious.
Sir!
It is working.
It is working. Only Spectre are dying.
Hello.
Are you for my esco...
Huh?
No?
Go!
- Thank you. I'll take this.
- No!
- What was that?
- Get him!
Time to go. Let's go!
It's clear.
Huh?
May I cut in?
Go get him.
I'll hold them off.
Cover the exits!
Paloma.
Don't let them get away!
Have you got them?
Nearly.
No!
Down!
Get them!
Don't let them get away!
Paloma, I know you're busy,
but the curtain's about to come down
on this one.
I can get a car.
Where do you need it?
I'll be right there.
Stay down!
Move!
Huh?
Come on!
Three weeks' training, really?
More or less.
We're still gonna need that car.
- Salud.
- Salud.
- Where are you taking me?
- I'm taking you back to Mother, darling.
Mother? Oh, no, no, no.
Oh. There you are.
Oh! No!
Stay there! You okay?
I'm great.
I'm gonna borrow
your plane. Sorry.
It's a shortcut.
This is my stop. Goodbye.
- You were excellent.
- You too.
Next time, stay longer.
- I will.
- Hey.
- A cigar for Felix.
- Thank you. Come on.
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
Come on, let's go.
No, no, no, sir.
I am not getting on that.
Well, that's a shame
because we don't have a choice.
Let's go. Come on.
Okay, okay,
what have we got here?
Sir, I just saved your life, okay?
Please remember that.
So, could you please tell me
what the hell is going on?
Where are you taking me?
Somewhere safe.
At least make it look hard.
Thanks, Felix.
You walked me into a trap. Get in.
What trap?
Spectre's dead. Sit.
- Who's dead?
- All of them.
Good.
What is this?
Explain it to me.
I don't have the words
to describe to someone like you.
Try one.
It's... perfect.
A perfect what?
What? Assassin.
- Thank you, Bond. Your mission's done.
- Why didn't it kill me?
You don't have to
answer those questions.
- Why Spectre?
- Bond, please stop asking these questions.
Quiet!
Speak up.
Because you were never
the intended target.
He was a target? Why?
I changed the DNA
like we decided.
Now the plan is complete
and I'm confused.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who is "we"?
- Did M make you build this?
- He is not allowed to do this.
He is out of line here, Felix.
- Did M order you to kill Spectre?
- Ash.
- Don't answer that!
- Is M behind this?
- He is out of line!
- Felix!
Ash, shut your mouth!
M. M helped me build it.
But please,
he does not have the vision
- for how to use it.
- Well, who does? Who does?
Blofeld? How did he know
I was going to be there?
Whoa!
I'm with Safin. You understand?
Yes. I am Dr. Obruchev.
I know who you are.
I don't know about you...
but I got a feeling in my gut
Ash might not be on our side.
We need to have a conversation
about the company you keep.
I'm with you.
That's a lot of blood.
So, where are we going?
Get in the plane, Doctor.
This might be my last mission.
What do you think?
I think you're just looking
for an excuse not to help me.
There you go.
Paloma, she gave me
a cigar for you to smoke,
and you are gonna smoke it.
Nice, but maybe you should
hold on to that for now.
You just stay put.
Keep the pressure on that.
I'm gonna find us a way out.
I'll be over here.
You know, Felix,
we really need to stop meeting...
- Whoa.
- Shit.
I was such a big fan of his.
Felix!
This doesn't look good.
Come on, Felix.
We've been in worse than this. Let's go.
It's like back when I was a kid
on that shrimp boat.
You're from Milwaukee.
Am 1? I thought I made that up.
He got me.
Just let me go.
Let me go.
You got this?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Make it worth it.
James...
it's a good life, isn't it?
The best.
Felix.
Felix.
Felix.
- Name?
- Bond.
James Bond.
How's retirement?
Quiet.
Hi. Where's Obruchev?
I thought you two
would get along.
Report, 007.
Thank you.
00... 7.
That must bother you.
Where is he?
He left me... for somebody else.
It's...
- So, you lost him?
- You can go in.
- Thank you.
- Thank y...
Alone, I'm afraid.
Oh. Does that bother you?
- I get why you shot him.
- Yeah, well,
everyone tries at least once.
Has this desk got bigger?
Or have you got smaller?
I can't pretend there weren't
some sorry faces when you left us, Bond,
but you fell so far off the grid
that we thought you must be dead.
Now, learning that you...
were, in fact, alive and well and...
working for the CIA, well...
Well, that really was a blow.
Well, they just asked so nicely.
It's a shame
that you haven't lost your touch.
We wouldn't be in this mess.
This is your mess.
Blofeld tried to kill me in Cuba,
but someone hijacked his plan.
And whoever stole your weapon
used it to wipe out Spectre instead.
Now your weapon is on the run
and nobody seems to know who has it.
So you can imagine
why I've come back to play.
We're looking into it.
I can identify the man
that took Obruchev.
And what do you want
in return, Bond?
Blofeld.
- Impossible. He's in Belmarsh.
- Yes.
He ran a Spectre meeting in Cuba
from Belmarsh.
- How?
- No.
How? No one has access.
No one.
Why didn't you shut it down?
Why didn't you shut Heracles down?
I answer to the interests
of my country, not you.
And to Felix Leiter?
I certainly don't answer
to Felix Leiter.
Perhaps because he's dead.
I'm sorry.
I had a lot of respect for Leiter.
Look, if you have information,
I'd be happy to receive it.
Get me into Belmarsh.
No. Blofeld's the only member of Spectre
still breathing. I can't risk that.
Oh, but you will risk developing
a DNA-targeting weapon
with a corrupt scientist for ten years?
There was nothing to suggest
that Obruchev was working for anyone else.
- I had him down.
- My God, you're thirsty at the moment.
You have no right
to speak to me that way.
You have no right to make insinuations
about my judgment.
If you've nothing left to give,
you are irrelevant.
You've done your bit
and we thank you for your service, again.
Goodbye.
Moneypenny, send in 007.
You can go, Bond.
It's definitely the same desk.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
Go to Belmarsh.
I want everything that Blofeld listens to,
looks at and touches scanned.
Scan every corner of that cell.
Scan the whole prison.
In fact, scan the whole damn man.
Sir. I'll bring my gloves.
James, uh...
what are you doing for dinner?
So, you're not dead?
Hello, Q. I've missed you.
Mmm! That smells great.
Were you expecting somebody?
Um... No. What... Excuse me.
Oh. This is the first time I've...
He'll be here in 20 minutes.
I can't take my focus off...
I need you to tell me
what's on that.
No, I need to lay the table.
You know,
they come with fur these days.
I want to be very clear
that I am not authorized to help you.
- And I have sworn...
- It's to do with Heracles.
I presume M doesn't know
that this is happening.
No, but there's something going on, Q.
We need to find out what it is.
Well, it's never 9:00 to 5:00, is it?
Thank you.
- Um, Bond?
- Yes?
Do you know where this has been?
Everywhere, I should imagine.
Into the sandbox.
Oh. Thank you.
Um, it's a database.
Don't touch that, please.
What's the data?
It's DNA. Multiple individuals.
What was M working on?
Something he should have
shut down years ago.
- Oh, hello.
- What?
There's more. Hidden files.
I was asked to recover what I could
from Obruchev's hard drive
just after the explosion,
and I have
a pretty good feeling that...
this is what was missing.
Yeah. A complete disk.
So, Obruchev is working for someone
who managed to kill all of Spectre?
Not all of them.
Blofeld.
Can you show me the other files?
Mm-hmm.
Wait, this can't just be Spectre.
Oh, my God.
There are thousands.
Who are they?
They're in categories.
I'm gonna need more time to organize...
There have been, uh, breaches
round the world of databases
holding DNA information.
- We've been tracking them.
- Ours?
I can't imagine they're leaving us out,
whoever they are.
Well, Blofeld will know who they are.
Q, you need to get me into Belmarsh.
Well, there's only one person
he'll speak to.
Who? M says no one has access.
- Really?
- Did he?
What's that?
Can I just have one nice evening, please,
before the world explodes?
Who has access? Who?
- Morning.
- Morning.
New patient. He's weird.
You can't say that.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I wasn't expecting a new patient.
Sorry if I surprised you.
No. I like surprises.
You're very attractive
for a psychotherapist.
Must be dangerous
for your clients.
They are usually more of a danger
to themselves.
Foxgloves.
Beautiful.
- Did you choose them?
- Yes.
I found them friendly.
You know if you eat them,
they can cause your heart to just...
stop.
Then I'll make sure not to.
Do you know a lot about flowers?
My father had a garden.
He taught me.
He died when I was young,
but my interest...
remained.
It's difficult to lose a parent.
Especially at a young age.
Yes,
death has a particular effect
on children...
doesn't it?
What effect did it have on you?
Profound.
But I saved a life once.
I think that had
more of an effect.
Why is that?
Saving someone's life
connects you to them forever,
the same as taking it.
They belong to you.
I'm not very good
at talking about myself,
so I brought a memory box.
I thought it might interest you.
Sometimes objects can be
more evocative than memories.
I never forgot your eyes
under the ice.
They needed me.
It is a shock to see them
SO many years later.
They still need me.
I am rather taken by them.
What do you want?
Just a favor.
You owe me.
You murdered my mother.
And your father killed
my entire family.
Parents.
I need you to visit someone for me,
wearing this.
It's harmless to you.
You are the only one who can do it.
No.
Why would I do anything for you?
Because I...
am a man willing to kill
the person you love most.
I've already lost
everyone I've ever loved.
There is nothing
you can threaten me with.
That is very sad to hear, Madeleine.
But it is not true...
is it?
Madeleine Swann, really?
Well, yes.
We took your information seriously,
but that was five years ago.
Nothing came up.
Well, she's very smart
and very good at hiding things.
She's a useful asset.
She's the only psychiatrist
he agreed to speak to.
I had to exercise my judgment...
Your judgment is the problem.
That weapon was designed
to save lives
and to eradicate collateral damage
for our agents.
A clean, accurate shot every time.
But it had to be off the books.
There are enough holes
in our national security.
If the world knows what this can do...
- They'd kill for it.
- Mmm.
Look...
if it's an error, it's on my shoulders,
fair and square.
I've dedicated my life
to defending this country.
I believe in defending
the principles of this...
Of this.
But we used to be able to
get into a room with the enemy.
We could look him in the eye.
And now, the...
the enemy is just floating
in the ether.
We don't even know
what they're after.
Blofeld.
We managed to access
a database of their targets.
"We"?
Oh, for fuck's sake.
I see.
And after Blofeld,
what do they want?
Well, it's hard to say.
I mean, I would imagine world leaders,
innocent civilians,
freedom, you know,
that sort of thing.
Oh, good, well, just the usual.
Just the usual.
Blofeld was communicating with his agents
in Cuba through a bionic eye...
which we've now retrieved.
You're welcome.
Spectre's destruction's
going to have huge consequences.
Whoever did this is going to be
very dangerous and very powerful.
We need all the information
that we can gather.
Sir.
Sir.
Bond.
So the rumors are true.
- You look well.
- Tanner.
Sir, there's been a development.
They were just dropping,
one right after the other.
It was disturbing, to say the least.
Wait till you see
what it looks like up close.
- Uh, Bond's in the office.
- What?
Oh, Bond.
My God, I haven't seen you in, uh...
How is your retirement?
Shut up, Q.
I know he's staying with you.
- And you're not in the clear either.
- What happened?
He's been reinstated as a double-0.
- Double-0 what?
- What have you got?
Q has studied the blood samples I gathered
from the victims of the funeral.
Just look at this.
What are we looking at?
This is the funeral of one of
the dead Spectre agents from Cuba.
And here are
the members of their family
who made physical contact
with the corpse.
We found Heracles
in the blood samples of all of them.
Now, that's some good work, Nomi.
Thank you, sir.
Double-0 what?
- What are they?
- They're... They're nanobots.
Right.
Microscopic bio-robots
that can enter your system
by the slightest contact with your skin.
Programmed with DNA
to target specific individuals.
Heracles was...
It was designed to be
the most efficient weapon in our arsenal.
Passing through people harmlessly
before reaching its intended target.
But Obruchev
modified the nanobots
so they can kill anyone
related to the target.
Anyone?
Well, since it's DNA-based,
with further modifications, yes.
Families, certain genetic traits.
Single-nucleotide variants
and polymorphisms
that could target a range
from individuals
to whole ethnicities.
- You infect enough people...
- And the people become the weapon.
It was never intended to be
a weapon of mass destruction.
It was in...
I need to call the prime minister.
Tanner, quarantine the families
from the funeral.
Yes, sir.
And, Q, hack into Blofeld's
bionic eye. See what you can find.
You've got your wish.
Go to Blofeld
and see what you can get out of him.
And find that cockroach Obruchev.
Sir.
We don't have a trail.
Logan Ash. State Department.
Ex-State Department.
Find him, you'll find Obruchev.
Um... Good luck.
Thanks.
I'll be outside when you're done
with your important preparation.
I'll be just a moment.
It's fine.
Blofeld's eyeball unlocked.
Accessing received media stream.
I know you and she have a history,
but we've kept a close eye
on her over the years.
She's been very compliant.
If Bond does anything weird in there,
you'll be doing me a huge favor,
so don't make it
too easy for him, okay?
Okay.
He's the most valuable asset
this country has.
I know you and he have a history,
but don't let him
get in your head.
If you feel yourself
losing control...
Oh, Tanner, relax.
I'm not gonna lose...
control.
Dr. Swann, good afternoon.
Mr. Bond.
Six-seven.
Special cell two now locked off.
Segregation unit secure.
This is where we leave you.
Good luck.
Just get us a name.
Must be nice to catch up
with an old friend so regularly.
We're closer than ever.
That was awkward.
Does he have that effect on all women?
Fifty-fifty. It's unpredictable.
Isolated in HSU.
You're shaking.
It's not an ideal situation.
Open the door.
Open the door.
Don't.
What is it?
James, you don't know what this is.
Don't make me do this.
Please.
Right. Open the doors.
- Open the door.
- Open it.
What...
Where are you going?
Home.
- I'll get her.
- Wait.
- He won't talk without her.
- Just wait.
Special delivery.
James.
Hello, Blofeld.
Perhaps you can help me.
Cuba was quite the party.
- Happy birthday, by the way.
- Thank you.
I'm trying to piece together
what happened.
I mean, there you were,
or here you were,
with the world's most powerful people,
your friends, all in one room,
a noose around my neck,
and your hands on
the most valuable weapon in existence.
It's like a...
It was like a testimony
to your greatness.
A celebration
of all that is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
Yeah, James.
Yeah.
But then it all went wrong,
didn't it?
My sweet James,
what do you want?
Your enemies are closing in, Blofeld.
And the biggest twist here
is that if you tell me who they are,
I could save your life.
Mmm, my avenging angel.
My chaser of lost causes.
Now you even chase mine.
But you're asking
the wrong question.
Yeah, Cuba was a disappointment,
but we all cry on our birthday.
You need fo ask yourself,
why are we here?
Accessing media file 472.
Hmm. Looking sharp, Bond.
476, 477, 478.
Logan Ash.
A pleasure fo meet you.
Oh, my God, that's him.
I am sorry for your loss.
I believe you know
who [I represent and work for?
We have an opportunity for you.
You keep coming back to me.
I thought I'd never see you again,
- but fate draws us back together.
- Yes. Q's got eyes on Logan Ash.
- Go.
- Yep. Let me know what happens.
Now your enemy is my enemy.
How did that happen?
Well, you live long enough...
Yeah.
Look at us.
Two old men in a hole trying to work out
who's playing tricks on us.
She still loves you.
Did you know that?
And you broke her heart.
And she betrayed you.
She is irrelevant.
Mmm, I wouldn't be
so quick to dismiss.
You said it yourself,
she's very good at hiding things.
And when her secret
finds its way out, and it will,
it'll be the death of you.
Just give me a name.
- Madeleine.
- Oh...
Please, just... Please, no games.
Madeleine.
Do you know what?
The two of you should come see me.
A little couples therapy.
I simply have to see your face
when she tells you the truth.
Just tell me who they are,
Blofeld...
and then I'll leave.
I'll leave you on your own.
No, I don't want you to leave.
We're just getting reacquainted.
Oh, all right. Come.
You were unusually patient.
I need to give you something
so that you didn't have to make
all this way for nothing. Come.
Careful, Bond.
It was me.
You destroyed Spectre?
No.
Vesper's grave.
Madeleine didn't do a thing.
It was all me.
I knew you'd come visit it.
I just needed to wait for the bon moment.
She led you straight there
from the goodness of her heart.
And then you left her for me.
It doesn't matter.
Oh, but it does.
She still does, doesn't she?
My poor little cuckoo.
You were always
SO very, very sensitive.
This isn't working.
Keep going.
All this wasted time,
the life you could have had.
And the reason all of this
is so beautiful, so exquisitely beautiful,
is that you're coming to me
looking for answers,
whereas the one person
who knows it all is she.
It's Madeleine.
She holds the secrets you need.
All of them.
I didn't need to kill you.
I'd already broken you.
I wanted to give you
an empty world...
like the one you gave me.
It's enough
to almost make me regret it.
Almost.
Die.
Mmm?
Die, Blofeld. Die.
Jesus. Open the door.
Bond!
Bond!
Bond!
Open the door. Bond!
Cuckoo.
- What the hell are you thinking?
- Yes, I know how to interrogate an asset.
This interrogation is over.
Tanner, don't lecture me!
Bond, you have violated
the most important rule
in the whole bloody playbook.
Don't move.
I'm gonna need those, I'm afraid.
He's dead.
It's a good thing you're not actually
related, or you'd be dead too.
- How do I get this off?
- You don't. You can't.
Nanobots aren't just for Christmas.
Once Heracles is in your system,
it's there forever.
- Did they find the car?
- We traced it, but she abandoned it.
They searched her flat.
She hasn't been home.
- Is she one of them?
- I don't know.
James, do you have any idea
where she might have gone?
No. I don't know her at all.
Is that for me?
No.
Then why did you come?
Because you told me to.
I didn't think
you would remember.
I remember everything.
You need to tell me
who gave you the poison, Madeleine.
Is he dead?
Yes, he's dead.
Good.
He told me you didn't betray me.
I understand
you're not built to trust people.
Neither are you.
Then we were fools for trying.
I wanted to.
I don't know
if you wanted me to come here...
or why you tried to kill Blofeld,
or who gave you the poison to do it,
or how long
you've been working for them,
but I do know...
that for what felt like
five minutes of my life,
I wanted everything with you.
And it's not because
I didn't trust.
It was just that feeling.
Now I've come here to find out
who gave you the poison...
but I'm not going to leave here
without you knowing
that I have loved you...
and I will love you,
and I do not regret a single moment
of my life that led me to you...
except when I put you on that train.
Do you know
the worst thing about you?
My timing?
Don't.
My sense of humor?
Don't.
What?
You look...
You look incredible.
This is Mathilde.
Um...
Hello. I'm James.
Sir, we've located Logan Ash.
007 wants a word.
Well done, 007.
Thank you, sir.
Permission for a capture or Kill.
Have we cleared this with the Americans?
Granted. And thank you for asking.
By the book, sir.
Your predecessor was less deferential.
To be fair,
Commander Bond gave me the lead.
Well, I'm glad to see you two
getting along.
Sir.
Have you located Dr. Swann?
Nothing, I'm afraid, sir.
Thank you.
If you hear anything,
what do you do?
I hide.
Very good.
- Bonne nuit.
- Bonne nuit.
- Dites bonne nuit monsieur.
- Bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit.
She's not yours.
But the...
Okay, the blue eyes, the...
She's not yours.
Okay.
I have something to show you.
Another child?
What is it with your dad
and secret rooms?
Talk to me.
I wanted to bring you here before.
To tell you everything.
Blofeld ordered my father
to assassinate this family.
The boy survived.
His name is Lyutsifer Safin.
When I was a little girl,
he came here to kill my father...
but he found me
and my mother instead.
He spared my life.
And now he's back.
- And what does he want?
- Revenge?
Me?
Who were they?
Spectre's poisoners.
My father held a banquet for them,
used their own recipe in the dessert.
Dioxin.
They would have suffered horribly.
Scarred him for life.
The family had an island.
They called it the Poison Garden.
Oh, so...
Blofeld took it from them
and kept running it,
and now this Safin
has taken it back.
Q, find one Lyutsifer Safin.
Whereabouts unknown
and no recent photographs,
but I'm gonna send you
some images of him as a boy.
And a picture of an island.
So, you know, do your best.
And I'm gonna need a plane
to get there, a big one.
I'll send you my location shortly.
You're going to find him?
There are a thousand reasons
why we need to find this man.
You just gave me a reason
to kill him.
I'm hungry.
How is it?
Not bad.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Bond.
Did you find the island?
Yes, it's part of a chain
in disputed waters
between Japan and Russia.
There's a chemical plant
aating back to the Second World War.
Seems fo have had quite a history.
Sir, Japanese intelligence have reported
suspicious activity on the island.
Q, bring up the satellite images
I just sent through.
These were taken
over the last few days.
If that is Safin there...
Then Heracles is there too.
Where do you need
this plane, Bond?
Hang on, Q.
Did 007 manage to locate Logan Ash?
She's closing in on him.
I'll send you her location.
I thought she was following
Logan Ash, not me.
What? She is.
James, where are you?
Put her in the back.
There you are.
In you get. Watch your head.
Where are we going?
We're going on
an adventure, darling. Hang on.
Q, I am gonna need
that plane, quickly.
I'm near @rland NATO base.
You think you can get it to me?
Right, yes. We'll be there.
Thank you.
Maman...
A mosquito bit me.
It's okay.
Dou Dou, do you like mosquitoes?
Maman...
Do mosquitoes have friends?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
Hang on.
James.
Mathilde!
They're above us!
Get out of here!
James!
You stay here.
I'll be back soon.
Anybody comes through that door,
you shoot them.
Unless it's me.
You be quiet, okay?
Stay really quiet.
Hey!
Go! Go!
There! Run him over!
Nice moves, Bond.
You won't be able to stop him...
so, why don't you
help me out, brother?
I had a brother.
His name was Felix Leiter.
Need a ride?
Where have you been?
Chasing after your lead.
Ash?
Dead.
They took Dr. Swann.
And her daughter.
I didn't know she had a daughter.
Did M get my plane?
Our plane.
I'm coming with you.
Thank you, 007.
Hello, Q.
Bond.
Sorry to get you out of bed.
The objectives of this mission
are threefold.
Confirm the presence of Heracles.
Kill Obruchev and Safin.
Get Dr. Swann and her daughter
off the island.
And, Bond, I hope they're there.
Thank you, sir.
Sir.
Permission for Commander Bond
to be redesignated as 007.
It's just a number.
Very well.
Agreed.
Good luck.
Bond, your watch.
It contains a limited-radius
electromagnetic pulse.
It'll short any circuit
in a hardwired network
if you get close enough.
Mm-hmm.
And how strong is it?
It's fairly strong.
"Fairly strong." What's that mean?
We haven't had the chance
to test it properly. Just be careful.
Right, this is Q.DAR.
It will map the space
as you move through it.
Don't touch that.
And smart blood will track you...
Whoops... and your vitals.
Bond, you don't mind a shot or two
whilst at work?
- Shall we?
- Well, I haven't had a drink
for three or four hou...
- Hours.
- Wow.
Doesn't sound like you.
Ow!
Good.
I assume you know
how the stealthy bird works.
No, no idea.
Gravity.
Welcome back, Mr. Safin.
Welcome to your family.
How are you progressing?
So, so good, Mr. Safin.
So, so good.
My request?
Svetlana?
Continue.
What is that?
Insurance.
A simple hair falls from your head,
and now I have your life in my hands.
And yours.
How damaged you must be
to threaten a little girl.
You're any less damaged?
You love a killer.
You bore his child
despite his rejection.
You've hidden and lied
your whole life.
You will do anything...
To survive.
You understand me
the same way I understand you.
Move.
My father's garden.
It was his toxic treasure.
Let me show her.
Give her to me.
No.
I can protect her.
Mathilde.
Remember what I told you.
Don't touch anything. Okay?
Mathilde.
It's a poison garden...
but it's perfectly safe.
Shh.
My father made this.
He loved his plants so much,
he would sing to them.
I want to show you
one of my favorites.
Some of these plants
are very dangerous,
but not all of them
are for hurting people.
I have plants that can do
all sorts of things.
Mathilde!
No.
This one makes you
do as you're told.
So you never misbehave,
and you're always good.
You mustn't misbehave, Mathilde.
And neither must your mother.
Ever.
- Do you like it here?
- No.
Well, you will learn to.
I grew up here, and you will too.
Such a beautiful child.
Perhaps we should have some tea.
- No.
- Make her see the light.
No. No, you can't separate us!
- Mathilde!
- Maman!
Remember what I told you!
I'll come looking for you!
Okay?
Don't worry.
You have me.
As soon as you have a line of sight
on the island, drop alfitude,
stay below radar.
You ever flown
one of these things before?
Nope.
Don't forget fo release the chute,
and open the wings.
Gravity isn't always your friend.
Look for a concrete structure
on the west side of the island.
That's your best bet for getting in.
Coming up for air, Q.
Right, good.
You should be entering
a World War II-era sub pen.
Doesn't seem fo get much activity,
but look out for cameras anyway.
Use your watch, Bond.
- What's going on?
- It's the equipment.
The cameras are down.
The whole lower sector.
I'll restart the system.
Okay.
Ah. There you go.
Sir, they're in.
Yes, we have it.
You should be able to see
the chemical plant's architecture.
Which one's Bond?
He's the psi.
He's the trident thingy.
Give us the layout.
Right.
You're at the edge
of a toxic merry-go-round.
The main activity should be
fowards the central hub,
which is directly above you.
Bond.
Bond, there's something...
There's something big up ahead.
I can't work out what it is. It's...
These walls must be thick.
Bond.
Bond? 007, do you read me?
- We've lost them.
- They've entered a blind spot, sir.
I can't work out
what it is they've walked into.
Well, just get them back.
Well, will you look
at those doors.
This was a missile silo.
Right.
Let's go.
Everybody, over there.
In the corner. Now.
- What? How?
- Move!
Move! On the ground!
Alarm.
Down, boy.
What are you doing?
You cannot explode laboratory, please.
This is suicide mission.
Come on.
You will never leave this island alive.
That was the farm.
And this is the factory.
They're mass-producing it.
Nomi, come and look at this.
Well, look, you cannot stop it, mister.
We have big plan, you know.
- We have big numbers.
- What is it?
It's a simulation.
They're not just attacking individuals...
They're going to kill millions.
It will not fit in a suitcase
this time, lady.
He's really getting on my nerves.
Well, shut him up.
Ow!
My nose.
We have to destroy
this whole facility.
There is no need for violence.
Mr. Safin, they use explosives.
Shut up.
Mr. Bond...
you have something of mine
and I have something of yours.
Why don't you come up
and we can talk about it?
Like adults.
Safin. Where is he?
If I don't come back...
blow it all to shit.
We don't have
enough explosives for that.
Yeah, but they don't know that.
He said you must drink.
For your health.
Do you trust him?
He made me kill your last master.
Why do you think
he let you join him?
I think he wants you to drink.
I want him
to give me my daughter back.
He said if you behave,
you'll see her. Drink.
Do you know what this flower does?
It makes you blind.
Just a drop of this in your eye,
and you'll never see again.
Losing one eye is a tragedy.
Losing two...
- No games.
- This is not a game.
Welcome.
On the floor.
Your sidearm.
Careful.
She is light as a feather.
All right!
Please, sit.
It's going to be all right.
Promise you,
it's going to be all right.
James Bond.
History of violence.
License to kill.
Vendetta with Ernst Blofeld.
In love with Madeleine Swann.
I could be speaking to my own reflection.
We've made slightly different choices.
No.
We've just developed different methods
for the same goal.
Only your skills die with your body.
Mine will survive long after I'm gone.
And life is all about
leaving something behind.
Isn't it?
Doesn't have to be ugly.
You leave my baby alone,
I leave yours.
What do you think?
I think you're right.
Thank you.
I think we are the same.
We both know what it feels like
to have everything taken from us
before we're even in the fight.
It would have been nice to have a chance,
you know, don't you think?
Just... we all should get a chance.
But this thing that you're building,
it puts everyone,
the whole world on a battlefield.
Nobody gets a chance.
The thing that no one wants to admit
is that most people want things
to happen to them.
We tell each other lies about
the fight for free will and independence,
but we don't really want that.
We want to be told how to live
and then die when we are not looking.
People want oblivion,
and a few of us are born
to build it for them.
So, here I am, their invisible god...
sneaking under their skin.
You know that history isn't kind
to those who play God.
And you don't?
We both eradicate people
to make the world a better place.
I just want to be a little...
tidier.
Without collateral.
I want the world to evolve,
yet you want it to stay the same.
Let's face it...
I've made you redundant.
No.
Not as long as there are people
like you in the world.
And with all due respect to the enormity
of your tidy achievements,
all you're really doing is standing
in a very long line of angry little men.
I'm not angry, just passionate.
Disable your explosives,
get off my island,
and you can take
this precious little angel with you.
And Madeleine?
- She stays.
- You know I can't do that.
Ah. That is a shame.
She really hoped you would.
She knows
it's her only path to survive.
You have her tell me that.
What mother wouldn't sacrifice herself
for her own child?
Is that what happened to yours?
My mother lay at my feet
as I watched her die.
Wait! Wait. Wait.
I'll do whatever you want.
Yes, you will.
I apologize.
I'm sorry.
Simple choices, Mr. Bond.
Like do you want to die
in front of your daughter?
Or do you want your daughter
to die in front of you?
No. No. No. No. No.
I am sorry.
I'm sorry.
Look at your father, Mathilde.
This is power.
I'm sorry.
I'm truly, truly sorry.
James!
Where is she?
The first shipment is on the dock
ready for pickup, Doctor.
Very good.
My Dou Dou.
If you don't want
my protection, then...
off you go.
Move. Our first buyers are arriving.
Sir, I've just detected
some suspicious activity.
Several high-speed transports
are headed fowards the island.
Origin unknown. Still no sign of 007.
Come on, Bond. Where the hell are you?
This is hopeless situation, lady. Please.
Bond.
Bond.
The party is larger
than the reservation.
Look, lady, please,
please just let me go.
There was never gonna be
a way out.
Stop this nonsense.
You don't have a chance, anyways.
Hey. Hey.
I have a good vial for your people,
good for West African diaspora.
It can be a good thing.
Whoal
You know, I do not need laboratory
to exterminate your entire race
from the face of the Earth.
- Do you know what time it is?
- What?
Time to die.
No!
Move! Move!
They dropped down to a lower level.
There has to be a stairwell down.
Maman!
Maman!
I lost my little Dou Dou.
Mathilde. Mathilde.
I looked for you all over.
Where were you?
I hid like you told me.
I love you.
Me too. I love you.
We should go.
Yeah.
It's Q. Do you read me?
Come in, 007. It's Q.
Traffic. We have traffic.
I think we just got buzzed.
Those are two Russian MiGs.
Traffic. TCAS, you have control.
I understand,
and I'm doing the best that I can.
Just please wait.
Sir, I've got the Navy,
the Japanese, the Russians,
all breathing down my neck,
demanding to know why we've got
a C-17 circling a disputed island.
Don't tell them anything just yet.
Ah. Just in time.
Nomi, you know...
Madeleine, Mathilde, they're my...
- Hey.
- Hi.
Q. Q, are you there?
Yes, Bond.
Do we have any Royal Naval vessels
in the immediate vicinity?
Uh, yes. Why?
We are gonna need
an immediate strike on this location.
This whole island,
it's a manufacturing plant for Heracles.
We don't have clearance
for missile strikes, do we?
Mm-mmm.
Bond, there's something else
you should know.
Several unidentified ships
are headed your way.
They're coming after Heracles.
How far out?
Uh, 20 minutes.
Q, patch me through.
- 007.
- M.
Our operation is attracting
a lot of international attention.
We're seeing what we can do.
Come on.
Let's go.
It's going to get
very cold out there, so...
I want you to have this.
That'll keep you warm.
I have to finish this. For us.
I know.
I'll just be a minute.
I've got them.
This might come in handy.
Thank you.
Q, talk to me.
Our uninvited guests
are 15 minutes away.
Bond, M here.
The situation is diplomatically complex.
We don't have a choice.
Fire on my mark.
If we launch,
the Russians, the Japanese
and even the Americans will want answers.
Well, don't give them any.
Rational minds, Bond.
I'm trying fo save this
from escalating to all-out war.
Mallory, if we don't do this,
there will be nothing left to save.
Fire on my mark.
007, there's another problem.
That room you were just in.
Yes, I know, I know,
I've got to open the blast doors.
Otherwise our missiles will bounce off it
like they've hit a trampoline.
Yes, I know, I know.
Find the control room.
It should be in a tower
just above the blast doors.
The missiles will take
about nine minutes from launch.
Do you think you can do it
before the ships arrive?
Plenty of time, plenty of time.
Bond. Bond, do you read me?
Yeah.
Yeah, Q.
- I read you.
- Sounds like you're in a rugby scrum.
I just showed someone your watch.
Really blew their mind.
Right, good.
Now, did you find the control room?
Well, my Russian is a little rusty,
but I think so, yeah.
Okay, Q.
I've done some research.
Old schematics...
Q, I am gonna need some...
Yes?
Bond?
Hello?
- Power.
- Power?
Right, the infrastructure
must go back to the 1950s,
so it's going to be an overly complicated
and intricate switching system.
Now, the order in which you engage it
will need to be extremely precise.
You're looking for a control panel.
There should be a counterweight clutch.
So, listen very carefully, 007.
The first thing you need fo do...
Got it.
I think.
Yep, that's it. Launch the missiles.
- Not until you're clear.
- Q, tell M to launch the missiles now.
Okay. Okay, okay.
Understood.
M, Bond says fire.
HMS Dragon here.
Admiral.
Sir.
M here.
What are my instructions?
You have permission to launch.
Roger. Launching the strike.
Missiles airborne. Nine minutes out.
No.
No. No, no!
Quite a mess you've made.
Like an animal.
Now we are both poisoned
with heartbreak.
Two heroes in a tragedy
of our own making.
Anyone we touch, we are their curse.
A stroke to their cheek...
a kiss...
would kill them instantly.
Yes...
Madeleine.
Yes, Mathilde.
You made me do this, you see.
This was your choice.
Q. Q, are you there?
Bond, there you are.
Are they safe, Q?
Yes, they're safe.
Bond, have you left the island?
There's a slight problem
with the blast doors.
Won't take a sec.
No, no, no. Bond...
The missiles have already launched.
Just get out of there.
Q, how dol I...
how do I destroy this?
If the silo doors are open,
- the missiles will deal with it
- No. No, no.
If you get it on you,
how do you get it off?
You know as well as I do
that you can't.
It's permanent.
Its eternal.
Which is why we have fo destroy it.
For Christ's sake, James,
Just get off the island.
It's harmless
unless you're near fo the target.
Yeah. Well, that's not gonna work.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
It's for Madeleine.
It's all right, Q.
It's all all right.
Would you put Madeleine on, please?
Yes, of course. How stupid of me.
Nomi, come in.
Can you put Madeleine on?
Madeleine.
- James.
- Madeleine.
I'm here.
Where are you?
Is it done?
- James?
- Yes. Yes, he's dead.
Are you both there?
Yes.
Good. You're safe. That's good.
Have you left?
No. Um...
I'm not gonna make it.
What?
No.
- You promised.
- Madeleine.
Just get off that island.
I know you can do this.
Everything's good now.
There's no one left to hurt us.
Madeleine...
you have made...
the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
She's perfect.
Because she came from you.
Oh, God. The vial.
You've been poisoned.
Yes.
There must be a way.
There must be a way.
We just need more time.
If we only had more time.
You have all the time in the world.
I love you.
I love you too.
She does have your eyes.
I know.
I know.
Very hard to know what to say,
but I thought we should gather
and remember.
And I...
I thought this was appropriate.
"The function of man is to live,
not to exist.
I shall not waste my days
trying to prolong them.
I shall use my time."
To James.
- James.
- James.
James.
James.
Right. Back to work.
Mathilde.
Quoi?
I'm going to tell you a story...
about a man.
His name was Bond.
James Bond.
We have all the time
In the world
Time enough for life
To unfold
All the precious things
Love has in store
We have all the love
In the world
If that's all we have
You will find
We need nothing more
Every step of the way
Will find us
With the cares of the world
Far behind us
We have all the time
In the world
Just for love
Nothing more, nothing less
Only love
Every step of the way
Will find us
With the cares of the world
Far behind us, yes
We have all the time
In the world
Just for love
Nothing more, nothing less
Only love
Only love
