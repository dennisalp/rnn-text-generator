Born of cold and winter air
And mountain rain combining.
This icy force both foul and fair.
Has a frozen heart worth mining.
So cut through the heart.
Cold and clear.
Strike for love and strike for fear.
See the beauty sharp and sheer.
Split the ice apart
And break the frozen heart.
- Hup, ho
Watch your step.
Let it go.
Hup, ho
Watch your step,
Let it go.
- Beautiful.
- Powerful.
- Dangerous.
- Cold.
Ice has a magic
Can't be controlled.
Stronger than one.
Stronger than ten.
Stronger than a hundred men!
Oh!
Born of cold
And winter air
And mountain rain combining.
This icy force both foul and fair
Has a frozen heart worth mining.
Cut through the heart.
Cold and clear.
Strike for love and strike for fear.
There's beauty and there's danger here.
Split the ice apart.
Beware the frozen heart.
Come on, Sven.
Elsa. Psst!
Elsa!
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up!
Anna, go back to sleep.
I just can't.
The sky is awake, so I'm awake.
So, we have to play.
Go play by yourself.
Do you want to build a snowman?
Come on, come on, come on!
Do the magic!
Do the magic!
Oh...
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.
This is amazing!
Watch this!
Hi, I'm Olaf, and
I like warm hugs.
I love you, Olaf!
Olaf...
Tickle bumps!
Oh!
Hang on!
Catch me!
Gotcha!
Again!
Wait!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Slow down!
Whoo!
Anna!
Anna!
Mama! Papa!
No, no...
You're okay, Anna. I got you.
Elsa, what have you done?
This is getting out of hand.
It was an accident.
I'm sorry, Anna!
- Oh. She's ice cold.
- I know where we have to go.
Ice?
Faster, Sven.
Sven!
Please! Help! It's my daughter.
It's the king.
- Trolls?
- Shush!
I'm trying to listen.
Cuties. I'm going to keep you.
Your Majesty.
Born with the powers, or cursed?
Born.
And they're getting stronger.
Here, here.
You are lucky it wasn't her heart.
The heart is not so easily changed.
But the head can be persuaded.
Do what you must.
I recommend we remove all magic.
Even memories of magic,
to be safe.
But don't worry.
I'll leave the fun.
She will be okay.
But she won't
remember I have powers?
It's for the best.
Listen to me, Elsa.
Your power will only grow.
There is beauty in it...
But also great danger.
You must learn to control it.
Fear will be your enemy.
No!
We'll protect her.
She can learn to control it.
I'm sure.
Until then...
We'll lock the gates.
We'll reduce the staff.
We will limit her contact with people,
and keep her powers
hidden from everyone.
Including Anna.
Ah.
Elsa?
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on, let's go and play.
I never see you anymore.
Come out the door.
It's like you've gone away.
We used to be best buddies
And now we're not.
I wish you would tell me why.
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman.
Go away, Anna.
Okay, bye
The gloves will help.
See? Conceal it.
Don't feel it.
Don't let it show.
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Or ride our bike around the halls?
I think some company is overdue.
I've started talking
To the pictures on the walls.
Hang in there, Joan.
It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms.
Just watching the hours tick by.
I'm scared.
It's getting stronger!
Getting upset only makes it worse.
Calm down.
No! Don't touch me!
Please, I don't want to hurt you.
See you in two weeks!
Do you have to go?
You'll be fine, Elsa.
Your Highness.
Elsa?
Please, I know you're in there.
People are asking where you've been.
They say "Have courage"
And I'm trying to.
I'm right out here for you.
Just let me in.
We only have each other
It's just you and me.
What are we gonna do?
Do you wanna build a snowman?
All ashore!
Welcome to Arendelle!
Watch your step, please.
The gates will be opening soon.
Why do I have to wear this?
Because the queen has come of age.
It's Coronation Day!
That's not my fault.
What do you want, Sven?
"Give me a snack."
What's the magic word?
"Please."
Uh! Uh-uh-uh. Share.
I can't believe they're
finally opening up the gates!
- And for a whole day!
- Faster, Percy!
Arendelle, our most
mysterious trade partner.
Open those gates so I may unlock your
secrets and exploit your riches.
Did I say that out loud?
Oh! Me sore eyes can't wait to
see the queen and the princess.
I bet they are absolutely lovely.
I bet they are beautiful.
Princess Anna?
- Princess Anna?
- Huh? Yeah?
Oh. Sorry to wake you, ma'am.
No, no, no, you didn't.
I've been up for hours.
Who is it?
Still me, ma'am.
The gates will open soon.
Time to get ready.
Of course.
Ready for what?
Your sister's coronation, ma'am.
My sister's corneration.
It's Coronation Day!
- It's Coronation Day!
- Ooh!
The window is open!
So's that door!
I didn't know they did that anymore.
Who knew we owned
8,000 salad plates?
For years I've roamed these empty halls.
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
Finally They're opening up the gates!
There'll be actual,
real, live people.
It'll be totally strange.
But wow!
Am I so ready for this change!
'Cause for the first time in forever.
There'll be music.
There'll be light.
For the first time...
In forever...
I'll be dancing through the night.
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy.
But I'm somewhere in that zone.
'Cause for the first time in forever
I won't be alone.
I can't wait to meet everyone!
What if I meet The One?
Tonight Imagine me gown and all.
Fetchingly draped against the wall.
The picture of sophisticated grace. Oh!
I suddenly see him standing there.
A beautiful stranger.
Tall and fair.
I wanna stuff some
chocolate in my face!
But then we laugh and talk all evening.
Which is totally bizarre.
Nothing like the life
I've led so far.
For the first time in forever...
There'll be magic,
There'll be fun.
For the first time in forever...
I could be noticed by someone.
And I know it is totally crazy
To dream I'd find romance.
But for the first time in forever...
At least I've got a chance!
Don't let them in.
Don't let them see.
Be the good girl.
You always have to be.
Conceal.
Don't feel.
Put on a show.
Make one wrong move
And everyone will know.
But it's only for today.
It's only for today.
It's agony to wait.
Tell the guards to open up...
The gate.
The gate.
For the first time in forever...
Don't let them in,
Don't let them see.
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of.
Be the good girl.
You always have to be.
A chance to change.
My lonely world.
Conceal.
A chance to find true love.
Conceal, don't feel,
Don't let them know.
I know it all ends tomorrow.
So it has to be today!
'Cause for the first time in forever...
For the first time...
In forever...
Nothing's in my way!
Hey!
I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?
Hey.
Uh...
No, no, I'm okay.
Are you sure?
Yeah. I just wasn't looking
where I was going.
But I'm great, actually.
Oh... Thank goodness.
Oh! Uh...
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.
Princess Anna of Arendelle.
"Princess"? My Lady.
Oh!
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Um...
- Whew.
Hi. Again.
Oh, boy!
This is awkward.
Not "You're awkward,"
but just because we're...
I'm awkward, you're gorgeous.
Wait, what?
I'd like to formally apologize
for hitting the princess
of Arendelle with my horse.
And for every moment after.
No! No, no. It's fine.
I'm not that princess.
I mean, if you had
hit my sister Elsa,
it would be... Yeesh!
Because, you know...
Hello.
But, lucky you,
It's just me.
"Just" you?
The bells. The coronation.
I better go.
I have to go. I better go. Uh...
Bye!
Oh, no. Oh!
Your Majesty, the gloves.
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.
Queen Elsa of Arendelle!
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.
Princess Anna of Arendelle.
Oh. Here? Are you sure?
Because I don't think
I'm supposed to...
Oh. Okay.
Hi.
"Hi" me? Oh...
Um... Hi.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
You look beautiful-ler.
I mean, not "fuller."
You don't look fuller.
But more beautiful.
Thank you.
So...
This is what a party looks like.
It's warmer than I thought.
What is that amazing smell?
Chocolate.
Your Majesty.
- The Duke of Weaseltown.
- "Weselton"!
Duke of Weselton, Your Majesty.
As your closest partner in
trade it seems only fitting
that I offer you
your first dance as queen.
One-two, and jump.
Uh...
Thank you. Only, I don't dance.
Oh...
But my sister does.
- What?
- Oh! Lucky you.
Oh, I don't think...
If you swoon, let me know.
I'll catch you.
Sorry.
Like an agile peacock.
Ow! Ow.
Speaking of, so great
to have the gates open.
Why did they shut them
in the first place?
Do you know the reason? Hmm?
- No.
- No.
All right. Hang on!
They don't call me
the "Little Dipper" for nothing!
Oh-ho!
Like a chicken with the face
of a monkey, I fly.
Let me know
when you're ready
for another round, Milady.
Well, he was sprightly.
Especially for a man in heels.
Are you okay?
I've never been better.
This is so nice.
I wish it could be
like this all the time.
Me, too.
But it can't.
- Why not?
- It just can't.
Excuse me for a minute.
I'd be honored.
Glad I caught you.
Hans.
Oop.
I often had a whole parlor
to myself to slide!
- Oh!
- Oops!
Sorry.
Your physique helps,
I'm sure, too.
Ah.
What's this?
Uh, I was born with it.
Although, I dreamed
I was kissed by a troll.
I like it.
Yeah, the whole thing.
You got it.
Okay, wait, wait.
So, you have how many brothers?
Twelve older brothers.
Three of them pretended I was
invisible, literally, for two years.
That's horrible.
It's what brothers do.
And sisters.
Elsa and I were really close
when we were little.
But then, one day,
she just shut me out,
and I never knew why.
I would never shut you out.
Okay, can I just say
something crazy?
I love crazy.
All my life has been
A series of doors in my face
And then suddenly
I bump into you.
I was thinking the same
thing, because, like...
I've been searching my whole life
To find my own place
And maybe it's the party talking
Or the chocolate fondue.
But with you...
But with you I found my place.
I see your face.
And it's nothing like
I've ever known before.
Love is an open...
Door!
Love is an open.
- Door.
- Door.
Love is an open door.
- With you. With you.
- With you. With you.
Love is an open door.
- I mean, it's crazy.
- What?
- We finish each other's...
- Sandwiches.
That's what I was gonna say!
I've never met someone
Who thinks so much like me.
Jinx! Jinx again!
Our mental synchronization
Can have but one explanation.
- You.
- And I.
- Were.
- Just.
Meant to be...
- Say goodbye.
- Say goodbye.
To the pain of the past.
We don't have to feel it anymore.
Love is an open door.
Love is an open...
- Door.
- Door.
Life can be so much more
- With you. With you.
- With you. With you.
Love is an open...
- Door.
- Door.
Can I say something crazy?
Will you marry me?
Can I say something even crazier?
Yes!
- Coming through.
- Excuse me. Oh...
- Pardon. Sorry.
- Oh!
Can we just get around you there?
Thank you. Oh! There she is.
Elsa!
I mean, Queen. Me again. Um...
May I present Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.
Your Majesty.
We would like...
Uh, your blessing...
Of our marriage.
- Marriage?
- Yes!
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
Well, we haven't worked out
all the details ourselves.
We'll need a few days
to plan the ceremony.
Of course, we'll have soup, roast
and ice cream. And then...
Wait. Would we live here?
- Here?
- Absolutely!
- Anna!
- Oh!
We can invite all 12 of your
brothers to stay with us.
What? No, no, no.
- Of course we have the room.
- Wait, slow down.
No one's brothers are staying here.
No one is getting married.
Wait, what?
May I talk to you, please? Alone.
No. Whatever you have to say,
you can say to both of us.
Fine. You can't marry
a man you just met.
You can if it's true love.
Anna, what do you know
about true love?
More than you.
All you know is how
to shut people out.
You asked for my blessing,
but my answer is no.
Now, excuse me.
Your Majesty,
if I may ease your...
No, you may not.
And I think you should go.
The party is over. Close the gates.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- What?
Elsa, no, no! Wait.
Give me my glove!
Elsa, please, please.
I can't live like this anymore!
Then leave.
What did I ever do to you?
Enough, Anna.
No, why?
Why do you shut me out?
Why do you shut the world out?
What are you so afraid of?
I said, enough!
Sorcery.
I knew there was something
dubious going on here.
Elsa.
There she is!
Yes! It is her!
Queen Elsa.
Our beautiful queen!
Your Majesty?
Are you all right?
No.
There she is! Stop her!
Please, just stay away from me.
Stay away.
Monster. Monster!
Elsa!
Elsa!
Wait, please!
Elsa, stop!
Anna!
No.
The fjord.
- Snow!
- Snow?
Yes, snow.
- Are you all right?
- No.
Did you know?
No.
Look, it's snowing.
It's snowing!
The queen has cursed this land!
She must be stopped!
You have to go after her.
Wait, no!
You! ls there sorcery in you, too?
Are you a monster, too?
No, no. I'm completely ordinary.
That's right, she is.
In the best way.
And my sister is not a monster.
She nearly killed me!
- You slipped on ice.
- Her ice.
It was an accident. She was scared.
She didn't mean it.
She didn't mean any of this.
Tonight was my fault.
I pushed her.
So, I'm the one
- that needs to go after her.
- What?
- Bring me my horse, please.
- Anna, no.
It's too dangerous.
Elsa is not dangerous.
I'll bring her back,
and I'll make this right.
I'm coming with you.
No, I need you here
to take care of Arendelle.
On my honor.
I leave Prince Hans in charge.
Are you sure you can trust her?
I don't want you getting hurt.
She's my sister.
She would never hurt me.
The snow glows white
On the mountain tonight.
Not a footprint to be seen.
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like
I'm the queen.
The wind is howling
Like this swirling storm inside.
Couldn't keep it in,
Heaven knows I tried.
Don't let them in,
Don't let them see.
Be the good girl,
You always have to be.
Conceal, don't feel,
Don't let them know.
Well, now they know.
Let it go!
Let it go!
Can't hold me back anymore.
Let it go!
Let it go!
Turn away and slam the door.
I don't care.
What they're going to say.
Let the storm rage on.
The cold never bothered me anyway.
It's funny how some distance
makes everything seem small,
And the fears that once controlled me.
Can't get to me at all.
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through.
No right, no wrong.
No rules for me.
I'm free!
Let it go!
Let it go!
I am one with the wind and sky.
Let it go!
Let it go!
You'll never see me cry.
Here I stand...
And here I'll stay.
Let the storm rage on.
My power flurries through the air
Into the ground.
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals
All around.
And one thought crystallizes
Like an icy blast.
I'm never going back.
The past is in the past.
Let it go!
Let it go!
And I'll rise like the break of dawn.
Let it go!
Let it go!
That perfect girl is gone.
Here I stand...
In the light of day.
Let the storm rage on!
The cold never bothered me anyway.
Elsa!
Elsa!
Elsa, it's me, Anna,
your sister who didn't mean
to make you freeze the summer.
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
Of course, none of it
would have happened
if she had just told me her secret.
She's a stinker.
Whoa!
Oh, no. No, no, no!
Come back!
No, no, no!
Okay.
Snow. It had to be snow.
She couldn't have
had tropical magic
that covered the fjords
in white sand and warm...
Fire!
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.
Ooh. "And sauna"!
- Yoo-hoo.
- Hmm?
Big summer blowout.
Half off swimming suits, clogs,
and a sun balm of my
own invention, yah?
Oh. Great.
For now, um, how about boots?
Winter boots and dresses?
That would be in our
winter department.
Oh. Um...
I was just wondering.
Has another young woman...
The queen perhaps,
I don't know,
passed through here?
The only one crazy enough
to be out in this storm
is you, dear.
You and this fellow.
Yoo-hoo.
Big summer blowout.
Carrots.
Huh?
Behind you.
Oh! Right. Excuse me.
Oh. A real howler in July, yes?
Wherever could it be coming from?
The North Mountain.
North Mountain.
That will be 40.
Forty? No, 10.
Oh, dear, that's no good.
See, this is from our winter stock,
where supply and demand
have a big problem.
You want to talk about
a supply and demand problem?
I sell ice for a living.
Ooh. That's a rough business
to be in right now.
I mean, that is really...
That's unfortunate.
Still 40.
But I will throw in
a visit to Oaken's sauna.
Yoo-hoo. Hi, family.
Yoo-hoo!
Ten is all I got. Help me out.
Okay. Ten will get you
this and no more.
Okay, just tell me one thing.
What was happening
on the North Mountain?
Did it seem magical?
Yes!
Now, back up while I deal
with this crook, here.
What did you call me?
Okay, okay. I'm out.
Whoa!
Bye-bye.
No, Sven,
I didn't get your carrots.
But I did find us a place to sleep.
And it's free.
I'm sorry about this violence.
I will add a quart of lutefisk,
so we have good feelings.
Just the outfit and the boots, yah?
Uh...
Reindeers are better than people.
Sven, don't you think that's true?
"Yeah, people will beat you
And curse you and cheat you.
Every one of them's bad,
except you".
Aw. Thanks, buddy.
But people smell better
than reindeers.
Sven, don't you think I'm right?
"That's once again true
For all, except you".
You got me.
Let's call it a night.
"Good night".
Don't let the frostbite...
Bite.
Nice duet.
It's just you.
What do you want?
I want you to take me up
the North Mountain.
I don't take people places.
Let me rephrase that.
Hey.
Take me up the North Mountain.
Please.
Look, I know how to
stop this winter.
We leave at dawn.
And you forgot the
carrots for Sven.
Oops, sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...
We leave now. Right now.
Whew!
Hang on! We like to go fast.
- I like fast.
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Get your feet down.
This is fresh lacquer.
Seriously,
were you raised in a barn?
Ugh!
- No, I was raised in a castle.
- Hmm.
So, uh, tell me,
what made the queen
go all ice-crazy?
Oh. Well...
It was all my fault.
I got engaged,
but then she freaked out,
because I'd only just met him,
you know, that day.
And she said she wouldn't
bless the marriage, and...
Wait. You got engaged
to someone you just met that day?
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad,
and so she got mad,
and then she tried to walk away,
and I grabbed her glove...
Hang on!
You mean to tell me you got engaged
to someone you just met that day?
Yes. Pay attention.
But the thing is, she wore
the gloves all the time,
so I just thought, maybe
she has a thing about dirt.
Didn't your parents ever
warn you about strangers?
Yes, they did.
But Hans is not a stranger.
Oh, yeah? What's his last name?
"Of the Southern Isles."
- What's his favorite food?
- Sandwiches.
- Best friend's name?
- Probably John.
- Eye color?
- Dreamy.
- Foot size?
- Foot size doesn't matter.
Have you had a meal with him yet?
What if you hate the way he eats?
What if you hate the
way he picks his nose?
Picks his nose?
And eats it.
Excuse me, sir.
He is a prince.
- All men do it.
- Ew.
Look, it doesn't matter.
It's true love.
- It doesn't sound like true love.
- Are you some sort of love expert?
No. But, uh,
I have friends who are.
You have friends
who are love experts?
I'm not buying it.
- Stop talking.
- No, no, no. No, no.
- I'd like to meet these...
- No, I mean it.
Sven, go.
Go!
- What are they?
- Wolves.
Wolves?
- What do we do?
- I got this.
You just...
Don't fall off, and don't get eaten.
But I want to help!
- No.
- Why not?
Because I don't trust
your judgment.
Excuse me?
Who marries a man she just met?
It's true love!
Whoa!
Whoa. Whoa!
Christopher!
It's "Kristoff"!
Ow!
Duck!
You almost set me on fire!
But I didn't.
Get ready to jump, Sven!
You don't tell him what to do.
- Hey!
- I do!
Jump, Sven!
Phew!
But I just paid it off.
Uh-oh. No. No.
No!
Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Grab on!
Pull, Sven. Pull!
Whoa.
I'll replace your sled,
and everything in it.
And I understand if you don't
want to help me anymore.
Of course I don't want to help
her anymore. In fact,
this whole thing has ruined me
for helping anyone ever again.
It's this way?
"She'll die on her own."
- I can live with that.
- Here we go.
"But you won't get
your new sled if she's dead."
I think, actually, it's up.
Sometimes, I really don't like you.
Hold up! We're coming.
You are?
I mean, sure.
I'll let you tag along.
Arendelle.
It's completely frozen.
But it will be fine.
Elsa will thaw it.
Will she?
Yeah. Now, come on.
This way to the North Mountain?
More like this way.
I never knew winter
could be so beautiful.
Yeah.
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
But it's so white.
You know, how about a little color?
I'm thinking maybe some
crimson, chartreuse.
How about yellow?
No, not yellow.
Yellow and snow?
No go.
Am I right?
- Hi.
- You're creepy.
- Whoa!
- I don't want it.
- Back at you.
- Please don't drop me.
- No.
- Come on, it's just a head.
All right.
We got off to a bad start.
Ew, ew, ew, the body!
Wait, what am I
looking at right now?
Why are you hanging off
the earth like a bat?
All right, wait one second.
Oh. Uh...
Oh!
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Now, I'm perfect.
Well, almost.
It was like my whole life
got turned upside down.
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry!
- Head rush!
- I was just... Are you okay?
Are you kidding me?
I am wonderful!
I've always wanted a nose.
So cute.
It's like a little baby unicorn.
But... Hey! Whoa!
Oh.
I love it even more.
All right, let's start this thing over.
Hi, everyone.
I'm Olaf.
And I like warm hugs.
Olaf?
That's right. Olaf.
And you are?
Oh. Um...
I'm Anna.
And who's the funky-looking
donkey over there?
- That's Sven.
- Uh-huh.
And who's the reindeer?
Sven.
Oh, the... Oh. Okay.
That makes things easier for me.
Aw, look at him
trying to kiss my nose.
- I like you, too.
- Olaf.
- Did Elsa build you?
- Yeah. Why?
Do you know where she is?
- Fascinating.
- Yeah. Why?
Do you think you could
show us the way?
Yeah. Why?
How does this work? Ow!
Stop it, Sven.
I'm trying to focus, here.
- Yeah. Why?
- I'll tell you why.
We need Elsa to bring back summer.
- Summer?
- Mmm-hmm.
Oh. I don't know why,
but I've always loved
the idea of summer.
And sun, and all things hot.
Really?
I'm guessing you don't have
much experience with heat.
Nope.
But sometimes I like
to close my eyes,
and imagine what it would be
like when summer does come.
Bees will buzz,
Kids will blow dandelion fuzz
And I'll be doing
Whatever snow does in summer.
A drink in my hand.
My snow up against the burning sand.
Probably getting gorgeously tanned.
In summer.
I'll finally see a summer breeze.
Blow away a winter storm.
And find out what happens
to solid water...
When it gets warm.
And I can't wait to see.
What my buddies all think of me.
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be.
In summer!
The hot and the cold
are both so intense.
Put them together
It just makes sense.
Winter's a good time
To stay in and cuddle.
But put me in summer and I'll be a...
Happy snowman!
When life gets rough.
I like to hold on to my dream.
Relaxing in the summer sun
Just letting off steam.
Oh, the sky...
Will be blue...
And you guys will be there, too.
When I finally do
What frozen things do
In summer!
- I'm gonna tell him.
- Don't you dare.
In summer!
So, come on! Elsa's this way.
Let's go bring back summer!
I'm coming!
Somebody's gotta tell him.
No, no. You've got
the bark facing down.
The bark needs to be face-up.
- Bark down is drier.
- Bark up!
- Bark down!
- Papa!
Cloak? Does anyone need a cloak?
Arendelle is indebted to you,
Your Highness.
The castle is open.
There is soup and hot
glogg in the great hall.
Here, pass these out.
Prince Hans!
Are we expected
to just sit here and freeze
while you give away all
of Arendelle's tradable goods?
Princess Anna has given her orders.
And that's another thing!
Has it dawned on you that your
princess may be conspiring
with a wicked sorceress
to destroy us all?
Do not question the princess.
She left me in charge
and I will not hesitate
to protect Arendelle
from treason.
Treason?
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa, boy. Easy.
Easy.
It's Princess Anna's horse.
So, where is the princess?
- Where could she be?
- Where is she?
Princess Anna is in trouble.
I need volunteers to go
with me to find her.
- I'll go.
- I volunteer.
I volunteer two men, My Lord.
Be prepared for anything.
And should you
encounter the queen,
you are to put an
end to this winter.
- Do you understand?
- Hmm.
So, how exactly are you
planning to stop this weather?
Oh. I am gonna talk to my sister.
That's your plan?
My ice business is riding on
you talking to your sister?
Yep.
So, you're not at
all afraid of her?
- Why would I be?
- Yeah.
I bet she's the nicest,
gentlest, warmest person ever.
Oh. Look at that.
I've been impaled.
What now?
Mmm...
It's too steep.
I've only got one rope and you
don't know how to climb mountains.
Says who?
Hmm?
What are you doing?
I'm going to see my sister.
You're gonna kill yourself.
I wouldn't put my foot there.
- You're distracting me.
- Or there.
How do you know
Elsa even wants to see you?
All right.
I'm just blocking you out
because I gotta concentrate, here.
You know,
most people who disappear
into the mountains
want to be alone.
Nobody wants to be alone.
Except maybe you.
I'm not alone.
I have friends, remember?
You mean, the love experts?
Yes, the love experts.
Ah...
Please tell me I'm almost there.
Does the air seem a bit
thin to you up here?
Hang on.
Hey, Sven?
Not sure if this is gonna
solve the problem,
but I found a staircase
that leads exactly
where you wanted to go.
Ha-ha! Thank goodness.
Catch!
Thanks. That was like a
crazy trust exercise.
Whoa.
Now, that's ice.
I might cry.
Go ahead. I won't judge.
All right, take it easy, boy.
Come here.
I got you.
Okay.
You stay right here, buddy.
Flawless.
Knock.
Just knock.
Why isn't she knocking?
Do you think she knows
how to knock?
Huh. It opened.
That's a first.
Oh. You should probably
wait out here.
- What?
- The last time I introduced her to a guy,
she froze everything.
But, but... Oh, come on!
It's a palace made of ice.
Ice is my life!
Bye, Sven.
You, too, Olaf.
- Me?
- Just give us a minute.
Okay.
One, two,
- three...
- Four...
Whoa.
Elsa?
It's me, Anna.
Anna.
Whoa. Elsa, you look different.
It's a good different.
And this place...
It's amazing.
Thank you.
I never knew what I was capable of.
I'm so sorry about what happened.
If I'd have known...
No, no, no. It's okay.
You don't have to apologize,
but you should probably go.
Please.
But I just got here.
You belong down in Arendelle.
So do you.
No, Anna, I belong here.
Alone.
Where I can be who I am
without hurting anybody.
Actually, about that...
- Sixty!
- Wait. What is that?
Hi! I'm Olaf and
I like warm hugs!
Olaf?
Yeah. You built me.
Remember that?
And you're alive?
Um... I think so.
He's just like the one
we built as kids.
Yeah.
Elsa, we were so close.
We can be like that again.
- Catch me!
- Slow down!
Anna!
No.
We can't. Goodbye, Anna.
Elsa, wait.
No, I'm just trying
to protect you.
You don't have to protect me.
I'm not afraid.
Please don't shut me out again.
Please don't slam the door.
You don't have to keep
Your distance anymore.
'Cause for the first time in forever...
I finally understand.
For the first time in forever...
We can fix this hand in hand.
We can head down
this mountain together.
You don't have to live in fear.
'Cause for the first time in forever...
I will be right here.
Anna.
Please go back home.
Your life awaits.
Go enjoy the sun
And open up the gates.
- Yeah, but...
- I know.
You mean well
But leave me be.
Yes, I'm alone.
But I'm alone and free.
Just stay away
And you'll be safe from me.
Actually, we're not.
What do you mean, you're not?
I get the feeling you don't know.
What do I not know?
Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep...
Deep snow.
What?
You kind of set off an
eternal winter everywhere.
Everywhere?
Well, it's okay,
you can just unfreeze it.
No, I can't. I don't know how.
Sure you can. I know you can.
'Cause for the first time in forever...
Oh, I'm such a fool!
I can't be free!
You don't have to be afraid.
No escape from the storm inside of me.
We can work this out together.
I can't control the curse!
We'll reverse the storm you've made.
Anna, please you'll only make it worse!
- Don't panic.
- There's so much fear!
We'll make the sun shine bright.
You're not safe here!
We can face this thing together.
No!
We can change this winter weather.
And everything will be all right.
I can't!
Anna!
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
I'm fine.
Who's this?
Wait, it doesn't matter. Just...
You have to go.
No, I know we can
figure this out together.
How?
What power do you have
to stop this winter?
To stop me?
Anna, I think we should go.
No, I'm not leaving
without you, Elsa.
Yes, you are.
Stop! Put us down!
Go away.
Heads up!
Watch out for my butt!
It is not nice to throw people!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, feisty-pants.
Okay, relax.
- Just calm down! Calm down!
- Okay! All right!
- I'm okay.
- Just let the snowman be.
- I'm calm.
- Great.
Oh! Come on!
Oh. Look, see?
Now, you made him mad.
I'll distract him. You guys go.
No, no! Not you guys!
This just got
a whole lot harder.
Look out!
Run! Run!
What are you doing?
I got him!
Whoa! Stop!
It's a 100-foot drop.
It's 200.
Ow!
- What's that for?
- I'm digging a snow anchor.
Okay. What if we fall?
There's 20 feet of fresh
powder down there.
It'll be like landing on a pillow.
Hopefully.
Okay, Anna. On three.
- Okay.
- One...
You tell me when. I'm ready to go.
- Two...
- I was born ready! Yes!
Calm down.
Tree!
What the... Whoa!
That happened.
Man, am I out of shape.
There we go. Hey, Anna!
Sven! Where did you guys go?
We totally lost
Marshmallow back there.
Hey! We were just
talking about you.
All good things, all good things.
No!
This is not making much
of a difference, is it?
Olaf!
Hang in there, guys!
Go. Go faster!
- Wait, what?
- Hey!
Ow!
Kristoff!
Don't come back!
We won't.
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.
Olaf!
I can't feel my legs!
I can't feel my legs!
- Those are my legs.
- Ooh!
Hey, do me a favor,
grab my butt.
Oh. That feels better.
Hey, Sven! He found us.
Who's my cute little reindeer?
Don't talk to him like that.
You're tickling me.
Here.
Whoa!
Are you okay?
Thank you.
- How's your head?
- Ah! Ooh!
It's fine. Uh...
Uh, I'm good.
I've got a thick skull.
I don't have a skull.
Or bones.
So, uh... So, now what?
Now what?
Now what?
Oh...
What am I gonna do?
She threw me out.
I can't go back to Arendelle
with the weather like this.
And then there's your ice business.
Hey, hey.
Don't worry about my ice business.
- Worry about your hair!
- What?
I just fell off a cliff.
You should see your hair.
No, yours is turning white.
White? It's... What?
It's because she struck you,
isn't it?
Does it look bad?
- No.
- You hesitated.
No, I didn't.
Anna, you need help, okay?
Come on.
Okay! Where are we going?
To see my friends.
The love experts?
- Love experts?
- Uh-huh.
And don't worry,
they'll be able to fix this.
How do you know?
Because I've seen
them do it before.
I like to consider myself
a love expert.
Get it together.
Control it.
Don't feel. Don't feel.
Don't feel.
Don't feel!
Look, Sven, the sky is awake.
- Are you cold?
- A little.
Uh...
Wait. Come here.
Huh?
Ooh.
So, uh, about my friends. Well...
I say "friends"...
They're more like family.
Anyway, when I was a kid,
it was just me and Sven.
Until they, you know,
kinda took us in.
- They did?
- Yeah.
I don't want to scare you.
They can be a little
inappropriate and loud.
Very loud.
They are also stubborn at times,
and a little overbearing.
And heavy.
Really, really, heavy.
But you'll get it.
They mean well.
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.
Okay, then.
Meet my family.
Hey, guys.
They're rocks.
You are a sight for sore eyes.
He's crazy.
Rocko's looking sharp, as usual.
Clay, whoa...
I don't even recognize you.
You lost so much weight.
I'll distract him while you run.
Hi, Sven's family!
It's nice to meet you.
Because I love you,
Anna, I insist you run.
I understand
you're love experts. Ooh!
Why aren't you running?
Uh...
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go.
- Go.
- No, no, no. Anna, wait.
Kristoff!
Whoa!
Hey!
Kristoff's home!
- Kristoff's here!
- Kristoff's home!
- Wait, "Kristoff"?
- Uh-huh.
Ah, let me look at you.
Take off your clothes,
I wash them.
No! No, I'm going to
keep my clothes on.
Look, it's great to see you all,
but where's Granpabbie?
He's napping.
But look, I grew a mushroom.
- I...
- I earned my fire crystal.
I passed a kidney stone.
Kristoff, pick me up.
You're getting big.
Good for you.
Trolls. They're trolls!
He's brought a girl!
A girl!
- Whoa!
- Is that a real girl?
She's like a little cupcake.
What's going on?
I've learned to just roll with it.
Let me see.
Bright eyes, working nose,
strong teeth!
Yes, yes. She'll do
nicely for our Kristoff.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, um, no.
- No.
- You've got the wrong idea.
No. That's not why I
brought her here.
Right. We're not... I'm not...
What's the issue, dear?
Why are you holding back
from such a man?
Is it the clumpy way he walks?
- What?
- Or the grumpy way he talks?
- Oh, no.
- Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped
Weirdness of his feet?
Hey!
And though we know he washes well.
He always ends up sort of smelly.
But you'll never meet a fella
Who's as sensitive and sweet.
That's nice, but...
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- So, he's got a few flaws
Like his peculiar brain, dear.
His thing with the reindeer.
That's a little outside
of nature's laws.
This is not about me!
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper.
But this we're certain of.
You can fix this fixer-upper up.
- With a little bit of love.
- Um...
Can we please
just stop talking about this?
We've got a real,
actual problem, here.
I'll say. So, tell me, dear...
Is it the way that he runs scared?
Or that he's socially impaired?
Or that he only likes
To tinkle in the woods?
I did not need to know that.
Are you holding back your fondness
Due to his unmanly blondness?
Or the way he covers up
That he's the honest goods?
He's just a bit of a fixer-upper.
He's got a couple of bugs.
- No, I don't!
- His isolation is confirmation
- Of his desperation for healing hugs.
- Aw.
So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper.
But we know what to do.
The way to fix up this fixer-upper.
Is to fix him up with you.
Whoa!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Enough!
She is engaged to
someone else, okay?
So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper.
That's a minor thing.
Her quote "engagement"
Is a flex arrangement.
And by the way, I don't see no ring.
So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper.
- Hey! Whoa, watch it!
- Her brain's a bit betwixt.
Get the fiance out of the way
And the whole thing will be fixed.
We're not saying you can change him
'Cause people don't really change.
We're only saying that love's a force.
That's powerful and strange.
People make bad choices
If they're mad or scared or stressed.
But throw a little love their way.
Throw a little love their way
And you'll bring out their best.
True love brings out the best.
Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper.
That's what it's all about.
- Father!
- Sister!
- Brother!
- We need each other to raise us up
And round us out.
Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper.
But when push comes to shove.
The only fixer-upper fixer
That can fix a fixer-upper is...
True, true...
True...
Love!
Love, love, love.
Love.
True love.
True...
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff
to be your trollfully wedded...
- Wait, what?
- You're getting married.
Love!
Anna?
She's as cold as ice.
There is strange magic here.
- Granpabbie.
- Come, come. Bring her here to me.
Anna, your life is in danger.
There is ice in your heart
put there by your sister.
If not removed, to solid ice
will you freeze, forever.
What? No.
But you can remove it, right?
I cannot
I'm sorry, Kristoff.
If it was her head,
that would be easy.
But only an act of true love
can thaw a frozen heart.
An act of true love?
A true love's kiss, perhaps?
- Something's wrong.
- Are you all right?
Anna, we've got to
get you back to Hans.
Hans.
Pull us out, Sven.
Olaf, come on!
I'm coming!
Let's go kiss Hans!
Who is this Hans?
We are here to find
Princess Anna.
Be on guard, but no harm
is to come to the queen.
Do you understand?
Yes, Your Grace.
The queen.
Go, go! Come on!
There!
Up there!
Come on!
We got her.
No. Please.
Go around. Toss it.
Stay away!
Look out!
Fire! Fire!
Get her!
Ah!
Come on!
Grab his arm.
Aim...
This way, this way!
Whoa!
Queen Elsa!
Don't be the monster
they fear you are.
Oh, no. What have...
What have I done?
Why did you bring me here?
I couldn't just let them kill you.
But I'm a danger to Arendelle.
Get Anna.
Anna has not returned.
If you would just stop the winter.
Bring back summer, please.
Don't you see?
I can't.
You have to tell them to let me go.
I will do what I can.
Just hang in there.
Come on, buddy, faster!
Oh, boy!
Whoa! I'll meet you
guys at the castle!
Stay out of sight, Olaf.
I will!
- Hello!
- It's alive!
It's Princess Anna!
Are you gonna be okay?
Don't worry about me.
Anna!
- You had us worried sick.
- My Lady.
Get her warm. And find
Prince Hans, immediately.
We will. Thank you.
Make sure she's safe.
Oh, you poor girl,
you're freezing.
Oh, let's get you inside now
and get you warm.
I'm going back out
to look for Princess Anna.
You cannot risk going
out there again.
If anything happens to her...
If anything happens
to the princess,
you are all Arendelle has left.
He's in here.
Prince Hans.
Anna.
You're so cold.
- Hans, you have to kiss me.
- What?
- Now! Now!
- Slow down.
We'll give you two some privacy.
What happened out there?
Elsa struck me with her powers.
You said she would
never hurt you.
I was wrong.
Anna.
She froze my heart,
and only an act of true
love can save me.
A true love's kiss.
Oh, Anna.
If only there was someone
out there who loved you.
What?
You said you did.
As thirteenth in line in
my own kingdom,
I didn't stand a chance.
I knew I would have to marry
into the throne somewhere.
What... What are you talking about?
As heir, Elsa was
preferable, of course.
But no one was getting
anywhere with her.
- But you...
- Hans!
You were so desperate for love,
you were willing
to marry me just like that.
I figured after we married,
I would have to stage
a little accident for Elsa.
- Hans!
- No. Stop.
But then, she doomed herself,
and you were dumb
enough to go after her.
Please.
All that's left now
is to kill Elsa,
and bring back summer.
You're no match for Elsa.
No, you're no match for Elsa.
I, on the other hand,
am the hero who is going to save
Arendelle from destruction.
You won't get away with this.
Oh...
I already have.
Please, somebody, help.
Please. Please.
It's getting colder by the minute.
If we don't do something soon,
we'll all freeze to death.
Prince Hans.
Princess Anna is...
Dead.
What?
What happened to her?
She was killed.
By Queen Elsa.
No!
Her own sister.
At least we got to say
our marriage vows
before she died in my arms.
There can be no doubt now.
Queen Elsa is a monster,
and we are all in grave danger.
Prince Hans,
Arendelle looks to you.
With a heavy heart,
I charge Queen Elsa
of Arendelle with treason.
And sentence her to death.
Hurry up!
She's dangerous.
- Move quickly.
- Careful.
- It won't open!
- It's frozen shut.
Put your back into it!
Come on! Push!
What is it, buddy?
Hey, watch it.
What's wrong with you?
I don't understand you
when you talk like that.
Stop it! Put me down!
No, Sven!
We're not going back.
She's with her true love.
What the...
Anna!
Come on! Come on, boy.
Help.
Anna!
Oh, no.
Olaf?
Olaf. Get away from there.
Wow!
So, this is heat.
I love it.
Ooh! But don't touch it.
So, where's Hans?
What happened to your kiss?
I was wrong about him.
It wasn't true love.
But we ran all the way here.
Please, Olaf, you can't stay here.
You'll melt.
I am not leaving here until
we find some other act
of true love to save you.
Do you happen to have any ideas?
I don't even know what love is.
That's okay, I do.
Love is
putting someone else's
needs before yours.
Like, you know, how Kristoff brought you
back here to Hans and left you forever.
Kristoff loves me?
Wow, you really don't know
anything about love, do you?
Olaf, you're melting.
Some people are
worth melting for.
Just maybe not
right this second.
Don't worry, I've got it.
We're gonna get through... Oh, wait.
Hang on,
I'm getting something.
It's Kristoff and Sven!
They're coming back this way.
They... They are?
Wow! He's really moving fast.
I guess I was wrong.
I guess Kristoff doesn't love you
enough to leave you behind.
Help me up, Olaf. Please.
No, no, no! You need to
stay by the fire and keep warm.
I need to get to Kristoff.
Why?
Oh, I know why!
There's your act of
true love right there!
Riding across the fjords like a
valiant, pungent reindeer king!
Come on!
Look out!
Oh!
Uh... Back this way.
We're trapped.
Oh...
Whoa!
Slide, Anna!
We made it!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Come on, buddy, faster.
Kristoff!
Keep going!
Kristoff!
Come on!
No.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Sven... Sven!
Good boy.
Kristoff.
- Kristoff...
- Anna...
Anna!
Elsa! You can't run from this!
Just take care of my sister.
Your sister?
She returned from the mountain
weak and cold.
She said that you
froze her heart.
No.
I tried to save her,
but it was too late.
Her skin was ice.
Her hair turned white.
Your sister is dead.
Because of you.
No.
Kristoff.
Anna!
Elsa?
No!
Anna!
Oh. Anna!
No, no!
Please, no.
Anna?
Anna?
Oh, Elsa.
You sacrificed yourself for me?
I love you.
"An act of true love
will thaw a frozen heart."
"Love will thaw."
Love. Of course.
Elsa?
Love!
I knew you could do it.
Hands down, this is the
best day of my life.
And, quite possibly, the last.
Oh, Olaf! Hang on, little guy.
Oh, Oh, Oh!
My own personal flurry!
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Anna?
But she froze your heart.
The only frozen heart
around here is yours.
Wonderful!
Setting course, sir.
I will return this
scoundrel to his country.
We shall see what his 12 big
brothers think of his behavior.
Arendelle thanks you, milord.
This is unacceptable.
I am a victim of fear.
I've been traumatized.
Ah! My neck hurts.
Is there a doctor that I could see?
And I demand to see the queen!
Oh. I have a message
from the queen.
"Arendelle will henceforth
and forever
no longer do business of
any sort with Weaseltown."
"Weselton."
- It's Weselton!
- Let's go.
Come on, come on, come on!
Okay, okay, here I come.
- Pole!
- Whoops! Sorry.
Okay, Okay.
Here we are. Oh!
I owe you a sled.
- Are you serious?
- Yes!
And it's the latest model.
No, I can't accept this.
You have to. No returns.
No exchanges. Queen's orders.
She's named you the Official
Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.
- What? That's not a thing.
- Oh, sure it is.
And it even has a cup holder.
Do you like it?
Like it? I love it!
Whoa.
I could kiss you!
I could. I mean,
I'd like to. I'd...
May I? We me.
I mean, may we?
Wait, what?
We may.
Mmm.
Summer!
Ooh...
Hello.
Are you ready?
Ice!
Ooh! Whoo-hoo...
Swing me.
Ooh...
I like the open gates.
We are never closing them again.
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,
but you know I don't skate.
Come on! You can do it!
Look out.
Reindeer coming through.
I got it, I got it.
I don't got it, I don't got it.
Hey, guys!
That's it, Olaf.
Glide and pivot.
And glide and pivot.
Go.
If you find my free work useful, consider buying me a coffee please....
Oh!
If you find my free work useful, consider buying me a coffee please....
Once upon a time
in a faraway land...
a young prince
lived in a shining castle.
Although he had everything
his heart desired...
the prince was spoiled,
selfsh and unkind.
But then,
one winter's night...
an old beggar woman
came to the castle...
and offered him
a single rose...
in return for shelter
from the bitter cold.
Repulsed by her
haggard appearance...
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away.
But she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances...
for beauty is found within.
And when he dismissed her again,
the old woman's ugliness melted away...
to reveal
a beautiful enchantress.
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late...
for she had seen that
there was no love in his heart.
And as punishment, she transformed him
into a hideous beast...
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle and all who lived there.
Ashamed of
his monstrous form...
the beast concealed himself
inside his castle...
with a magic mirror as
his only window to the outside world.
The rose she had offered...
was truly an enchanted rose...
which would bloom
until his 21 st year.
If he could learn
to love another...
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell...
then the spell
would be broken.
If not,
he would be doomed...
to remain a beast
for all time.
As the years passed...
he fell into despair
and lost all hope...
for who could ever learn
to love a beast?
Little town
It's a quiet village
Every day
like the one before
Little town
full of little people
Waking up to say
There goes the baker
with his tray like always
The same old
bread and rolls to sell
Every morning
just the same
Since the morning
that we came
- To this poor provincial town
- Good morning, Belle.
- Morning, monsieur.
- Where you off to?
The bookshop. I just fnished
the most wonderful story...
- about a beanstalk and an ogre and...
- That's nice.
Marie, the baguettes!
Hurry up!
Look, there she goes
The girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted
Can't you tell
- Never part of any crowd
- 'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl
that Belle
- Bonjour
- Good day
How is your family
- Bonjour
- Good day
How is your wife
- I need six eggs
- That's too expensive
There must be more
than this provincial life
- Ah, Belle!
- Good morning.
- I've come to return
the book I borrowed.
- Finished already?
Oh, I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new?
Not since yesterday.
That's all right.
I'll borrow this one.
That one?
But you've read it twice!
Well, it's my favourite!
Far-off places...
daring sword fghts, magic spells,
a prince in disguise.
If you like it all that much,
it's yours.
- But, sir!
- I insist.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Look, there she goes
That girl is so peculiar
I wonder if
she's feeling well
- With a dreamy, far-off look
- And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle
to the rest of us is Belle
Oh
Isn't this amazing
It's my favourite part
Because you'll see
Here's where
she meets Prince Charming
But she won't
discover that it's him
Till chapter three
Hey-hey!
Hey-hey-hey!
Now it's no wonder
that her name means beauty
Her looks have got
no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different
from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us
is Belle
Wow! You didn't
miss a shot, Gaston!
- You're the greatest hunter
in the whole world!
- I know.
No beast alive stands
a chance against you...
- and no girl, for that matter.
- It's true, Lefou.
And I've got my sights
set on that one.
- The inventor's daughter?
- She's the one!
- The lucky girl I'm going to marry.
- But she...
- The most beautiful girl in town.
- I know, but...
That makes her the best!
- And don't I deserve the best?
- Well, of course! I mean, you do!
Right from the moment
when I met her, saw her
Right from the moment
when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous
and I fell
Here in town
there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans
to woo and marry Belle
Look, there he goes
Isn't he dreamy
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong
and handsome brute
- Bonjour
- Good day
- You call this bacon
- What lovely grapes
- Some cheese
- Ten yards
- Excuse me
- I'll get the knife
- Please let me through
- This bread, it's stale
- Those fish, they smell
- Madame's mistaken
There must be more than
this provincial life
Just watch, I'm going
to make Belle my wife
Look, there she goes, a girl
who's strange but special
A most peculiar
mademoiselle
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is
a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle
- Hello, Belle.
- Bonjour, Gaston.
Gaston, may I have
my book, please?
How can you read this?
There's no pictures!
Well, some people
use their imagination.
Belle, it's about time you got
your head out of those books...
and paid attention
to more important things.
Like me.
The whole town's
talking about it.
It's not right
for a woman to read.
Soon she starts
getting ideas and thinking.
- Gaston, you are positively primeval.
- Why, thank you, Belle.
What do you say you and me
take a walk over to the tavern...
- and take a look at my trophies?
- Maybe some other time.
- What's wrong with her?
- She's crazy.
- He's gorgeous!
Please, Gaston, I can't.
I have to get home to help my father.
Goodbye.
That crazy old loon!
He needs all the help he can get.
Don't talk about
my father that way!
Yeah! Don't talk about
her father that way!
My father is not crazy.
He's a genius!
- Papa?
- How on earth did that happen?
- Doggone it!
- Are you all right, Papa?
L-I'm a... I'm about ready
to give up on this hunk of junk.
- You always say that.
- I mean it this time!
I'll never get this
boneheaded contraption to work!
Yes, you will, and you'll win
frst prize at the fair tomorrow.
- Hmph!
- And become a world-famous inventor.
- You really believe that?
- I always have.
Well, what are we waitin' for?
I'll have this thing fxed in no time.
Hand me that... the... the...
the dog-legged clincher there.
So, did you have a good time
in town today?
I got a new book.
Papa, do you think I'm odd?
My daughter? Odd?
Where would you get
an idea like that?
Oh, I don't know. It's just that
I'm not sure I ft in here.
There's no one I can really talk to.
What about that Gaston?
H-He's a handsome fella.
He's handsome, all right,
and rude and conceited and...
- Oh, Papa, he's not for me.
- Well, don't you worry...
'cause this invention's gonna be
the start of a new life for us.
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.
- It works!
- It does?
- It does!
- You did it!
You really did it!
Hitch up Philippe, girl.
I'm off to the fair!
Goodbye, Papa.
Good luck!
Goodbye, Belle.
Take care while I'm gone.
We should be there by now.
We should be there by now.
Maybe we missed a turn.
I guess I should've taken...
Wait a minute.
No. Let's go this way.
Come on, Philippe, it's a short cut.
We'll be there in no time.
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?
We better turn around.
Whoa. Whoa, boy.
Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.
Oh! Oh!
Look out! No!
Oh! Oh!
Look out! No!
Whoa!
Whoa, boy!
Back up, back up, back up!
Good boy! Good boy.
That's good, that's... Back up!
Steady, steady, now.
Steady.
Steady. No, Philippe!
Philippe?
Oh.
Help!
Is... Is someone there?
Help!
Oh!
Wha... Oh!
Hello?
Hello!
Poor fellow must have
lost his way in the woods.
Keep quiet.
Maybe he'll go away.
Is someone there?
Not a word, Lumiere.
Not one word!
L-I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse...
and... and I need a place
to stay for the night.
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.
Shh!
O-O-Ow! Ow! Ow!
Of course, monsieur,
you are welcome here.
Who said that?
Over here.
- Where?
- Hello.
Incredible!
Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.
Splendid! Just peachy!
- How is this accomplished?
- Put me down at once!
Stop that! Hee-hee-hee.
Stop that, I say!
Sir, close that at once!
- Do you mind?
- L-I beg your pardon?
It's... It's just that I've
never seen a clock that...
Oh, you are soaked
to the bone, monsieur.
Come.
Warm yourself by the fre.
- Thank you.
- No, no, no!
You know what the master will do
if he fnds him here.
I demand that you stop
right there!
Oh, no, no!
Not the master's chair!
Oh, no, no!
Not the master's chair!
I'm not seeing this!
I'm not seeing this!
Well, hello there, boy.
- Oh, what service!
- All right!
This has gone far enough.
I'm in charge here...
Ah, would you like a spot of tea, sir?
It'll warm you up in no time.
No! No tea. No tea!
His mustache tickles, Mama!
Oh! Hello!
Uh-oh.
There's a stranger here.
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.
He was cold and wet, so...
Master, I'd like to take
this moment to say...
I was against this from the start.
It was all his fault.
I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No, no...
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
L-l-I was lost in the woods and...
- You are not welcome here!
- L-l-I'm sorry.
- What are you staring at?
- N-Nothing.
So, you've come to stare
at the beast, have you?
Please, I meant no harm!
L-I just needed a place to stay.
- I'll give you a place to stay!
- No, no, please! No! No!
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get
the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?
Yep, this is her lucky day.
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.
First I better go in there
and propose to the girl.
And you, Lefou, now, when
Belle and I come out that door...
Oh, I know! I know!
L-I strike up the band!
- Not yet!
- Sorry.
Oh!
Gaston,
what a pleasant surprise.
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.
You know, Belle,
there's not a girl in town who
wouldn't love to be in your shoes.
This is the day...
This is the day
your dreams come true.
This is the day
your dreams come true.
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?
Plenty!
Here. Picture this.
A rustic hunting lodge,
my latest kill roasting on the fre...
and my little wife
massaging my feet...
while the little ones
play on the floor with the dogs.
- We'll have six or seven.
- Dogs?
No, Belle.
- Strapping boys like me.
- Imagine that.
- Do you know who that
little wife will be?
- Let me think.
- You, Belle.
- Gaston, I'm...
I'm speechless.
I really don't know
what to say.
- Say you'll marry me.
- I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...
but I just don't deserve you!
So, how'd it go?
I'll have Belle for my wife.
Make no mistake about that.
Touchy!
Is he gone?
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.
Me, the wife of that
boorish, brainless...
Madame Gaston
Can't you just see it
Madame Gaston
his little wife
No, sir, not me
I guarantee it
I want much more than
this provincial life
I want much more than
this provincial life
I want adventure
in the great wide somewhere
I want it more
than I can tell
And for once
it might be grand
To have someone understand
I want so much more
than they've got planned
Philippe! What are you
doing here? Where's...
Philippe! What are you
doing here? Where's...
Where's Papa? Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?
Oh, we have to fnd him.
You have to take me to him.
What is this place?
Philippe, please, steady.
Steady.
Papa!
Couldn't keep quiet,
could we?
Just had to invite him to stay,
didn't we?
Serve him tea,
sit in the master's chair.
- Pet the pooch!
- I was trying to be hospitable.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
Papa? Papa?
Are you here?
Mama, there's a girl
in the castle.
Now, Chip, I'll not have you
making up such wild stories.
Really, Mama.
I saw her.
- Not another word. Into the tub.
- But... What...
A girl!
I saw a girl in the castle!
See, I told ya!
Irresponsible, devil-may-care,
waxy eared, slack-jawed...
Papa?
Did you see that?
- It's a girl!
- I know it's a girl.
Don't you see? She's the one!
The girl we have been waiting for!
- She has come to break the spell!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Papa?
Papa?
Hello?
Is someone here?
Wait!
I'm looking for my father. L...
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.
L-Is anyone here?
- Belle?
- Papa!
- H-H-How did you fnd me?
- Oh, your hands are like ice.
- We have to get you out of there.
- Belle, I want you to leave this place.
- Who's done this to you?
- No time to explain.
- You must go. Now!
- I won't leave you.
- What are you doing here?
- Run, Belle!
- Who's there? Who are you?
- The master of this castle.
I've come for my father.
Please let him out.
- Can't you see he's sick?
- Then he shouldn't have trespassed here!
But he could die.
Please, I'll do anything.
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.
Oh, there must be some way
I can... Wait!
- Take me instead.
- You?
You would take his place?
Belle, no! You don't know
what you're doing!
If I did,
would you let him go?
Yes, but you must promise
to stay here forever.
Come into the light.
No, Belle!
I won't let you do this!
- You have my word.
- Done!
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.
- Wait!
- Belle!
- Wait!
No! Please spare my daughter.
Please!
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.
Let me out.
Please let me out!
Let me out!
Please! Please!
- Master?
- What?
Uh, since the girl is going to be
with us for quite some time...
I was thinking that you might want
to offer her a more comfortable room.
Then again, maybe not.
You didn't even let me
say goodbye.
I'll never see him again.
- I didn't get to say goodbye.
- I'll show you to your room.
My room?
But I thought...
- You wanna... You wanna
stay in the tower?
- No.
Then follow me.
- Say something to her.
- Huh? Oh.
I, uh, hope you like it here.
The castle is your home now,
so you can go anywhere you like
except the west wing.
- What's in the west...
- It's forbidden!
Now, if you need anything,
my servants will attend you.
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!
Who does she think she is? That girl
has tangled with the wrong man.
- No one says no to Gaston!
- Darn right!
Dismissed! Rejected!
Publicly humiliated!
Why, it's more
than I can bear.
- More beer?
- What for? Nothing helps.
- I'm disgraced.
- Who, you? Never!
Gaston, you've got to
pull yourself together.
Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston
Looking so
down in the dumps
Every guy here'd
love to be you, Gaston
Even when taking
your lumps
There's no man in town
as admired as you
You're everyone's
favourite guy
Everyone's awed
and inspired by you
And it's not very hard
To see why
No one's
Slick as Gaston
No one's quick as Gaston
No one's neck's as
incredibly thick as Gaston
For there's no man in town
half as manly
Perfect
A pure paragon
You can ask any
Tom, Dick or Stanley
And they'll tell you whose team
they prefer to be on
No one's
Been like Gaston
a kingpin like Gaston
No one's got a swell cleft
in his chin like Gaston
As a specimen
yes, I'm intimidating
My, what a guy
that Gaston
Give 5 hurrahs
Give 12 hip-hips
Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips
No one
Fights like Gaston
Douses lights like Gaston
In a wrestling match
nobody bites like Gaston
For there's no one
as burly and brawny
As you see
I've got biceps to spare
- Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny
- That's right!
And every last inch of me's
covered with hair
- No one hits like Gaston
- Matches wits like Gaston
In a spitting match
nobody spits like Gaston
I'm especially good at expectorating
- Ptooey!
- Ten points for Gaston
When I was a lad
I ate four dozen eggs
Every morning
to help me get large
And now that I'm grown
I eat five dozen eggs
So I'm roughly the size
of a barge
No one
Shoots like Gaston
Makes those beauts like Gaston
Shoots like Gaston
Makes those beauts like Gaston
Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston
I use antlers in all
of my decorating
My, what a guy
Gaston
- Help! Someone help me!
- Maurice?
Please! Please, I need your help.
He's got her... He's got her
locked in the dungeon!
- Who?
- Belle. We must go.
Not... Not a minute to lose.
Whoa! Slow down, Maurice.
Who's got Belle
locked in a dungeon?
A beast!
A horrible, monstrous beast!
- Is it a big beast?
- Huge!
- With a long, ugly snout?
- Hideously ugly!
- And sharp, cruel fangs?
- Yes, yes! Will you help me?
All right, old man.
We'll help you out.
You will? Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!
You will? Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!
Crazy old Maurice.
He's always good
for a laugh.
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?
Crazy old Maurice. Hmm.
Lefou, I'm afraid
I've been thinking
- A dangerous pastime
- I know
But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father
And his sanity's
only so-so
Now, the wheels in my head
have been turning
Since I looked at
that loony old man
See, I promised myself
I'd be married to Belle
See, I promised myself
I'd be married to Belle
And right now
I'm evolving a plan
- If l...
- Yes?
- Then we...
- No, would she?
- Guess!
- Now I get it!
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
No one
Plots like Gaston
Takes cheap shots like Gaston
Plans to persecute harmless
crackpots like Gaston
So his marriage
we soon will be celebrating
My, what a guy
Gaston
Will no one help me?
- Who is it?
- Mrs Potts, dear.
I thought you might like
a spot of tea.
But you're...
You're a...
- Oh! Careful.
- This is impossible!
I know it is,
but here we are.
I told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't I?
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.
Slowly now.
- Don't spill.
- Thank you.
Wanna see me
do a trick?
- Chip!
- Oops, sorry.
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.
- We all think so.
- But I've lost my father...
my dreams, everything.
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out all right in the end.
You'll see.
Oh, listen to me...
Jabberin' on while there's
a supper to get on the table.
- Chip?
- Bye!
Well, now, what shall we
dress you in for dinner?
Oh, let's see what I got
in my drawers.
Oh, how embarrassing!
Ahem.
Ah, here we are!
You'll look ravishing
in this one!
That's very kind of you,
but I'm not going to dinner.
Ah, but you must!
Ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem.
Dinner is served.
What's taking so long?
I told her to come down.
- Why isn't she here yet?
- Oh, try to be patient, sir.
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom all in one day.
Master, have you thought
that perhaps...
this girl could be the one
to break the spell?
Of course I have!
I'm not a fool.
Good!
So, you fall in love with her...
she falls in love with you,
and poof!
The spell is broken.
We'll be human again by midnight.
Oh, it's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.
But the rose has already
begun to wilt.
Oh, it's no use.
She's so beautiful and I'm...
Well, look at me!
Oh, you must help her
to see past all that.
I don't know how.
Well, you can start by
making yourself more presentable.
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.
Ah, yes. When she comes in,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.
Come, come.
Show me the smile.
- But don't frighten the poor girl.
- Impress her with your rapier wit.
But be gentle.
- Shower her with compliments.
- But be sincere.
And above all,
you must control your temper!
Here she is!
Good evening.
Well, where is she?
Who? Oh, ha ha ha!
The girl, yes. The girl.
Well, actually,
she's in the process of...
Circumstances
being what they are...
Uh, she's not coming.
What!
Oh, dear. Your Grace!
Your Eminence!
Let's not be hasty!
- I thought I told you
to come down to dinner!
- I'm not hungry.
You'll come out or I'll... I'll...
I'll break down the door!
Master, I could be wrong,
but that may not be...
the best way to win
the girl's affections.
Please attempt
to be a gentleman.
But she is being so diffcult.
Gently, gently.
- Will you come down to dinner?
- No!
Suave, genteel.
It would give me
great pleasure...
if you would
Join me for dinner.
And we say please.
- Please.
- No, thank you.
- You can't stay in there forever!
- Yes, I can.
Fine! Then go ahead
and starve!
If she doesn't eat with me,
then she doesn't eat at all!
Oh, dear. That didn't
go very well at all, did it?
Lumiere, stand watch
at the door...
and inform me at once
if there is the slightest change.
You can count on me,
mon capitaine.
Well, we might as well
go downstairs and start cleaning up.
I ask nicely, but she refuses.
Wh-Wh-What...
What does she want me to do, beg?
Show me the girl.
But the master's really not so bad
once you get to know him.
- Why don't you give him a chance?
- I don't want to get to know him.
I don't want to have
anything to do with him.
I don't want to have
anything to do with him.
I'm just fooling myself.
She'll never see me
as anything...
but a monster.
It's hopeless.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes!
I've been burnt by you before.
Zut alors!
She has emerged!
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.
But I'm not sleepy.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
I work and I slave all day long,
and for what?
A culinary masterpiece
gone to waste!
Oh, stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn!
After all, he did say please.
But if the master
doesn't learn to control that temper,
he'll never break the...
Splendid to see you
out and about, mademoiselle.
I am Cogsworth,
head of the household.
- This is Lumiere.
- Enchant, chrie.
If there's... stop that...
anything we... please... can do...
to make your stay
more comfortable...
- I am a little hungry.
- You are?
Hear that?
She's hungry!
Stoke the fre. Break out the silver.
Wake the china.
Remember what
the master said.
Oh, pish tosh! I'm not about
to let the poor child go hungry.
All right, fne. Glass of water,
crust of bread and then...
Cogsworth,
I am surprised at you!
She's not a prisoner.
She's our guest!
We must make her feel welcome here.
Right this way, mademoiselle.
Well, keep it down.
If the master fnds out about this,
it will be our necks.
Of course, of course.
But what is dinner
without a little music?
Music?
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure...
that we welcome you tonight.
And now
we invite you to relax.
And now
we invite you to relax.
Let us pull up a chair
as the dining room proudly presents...
your dinner.
Be our guest
Be our guest
Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, chrie
and we provide the rest
Soup du jour
Hot hors d'oeuvres
Why, we only live to serve
Try the grey stuff
It's delicious
Don't believe me
Ask the dishes
They can sing
They can dance
After all, miss
this is France
And a dinner here
is never second best
Go on, unfold your menu
Take a glance and then
you'll be our guest
Oui, our guest
Be our guest
Beef ragout, cheese souffl
Pie and pudding en flamb
We'll prepare and serve with flair
a culinary cabaret
You're alone and you're scared
but the banquet's all prepared
No one's gloomy
or complaining
While the flatware's entertaining
We tell jokes, I do tricks
with my fellow candlesticks
Und it's all in perfect taste
that you can bet
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass
To be our guest
if you're stressed
It's fine dining
we suggest
Be our guest, be our guest
Be our guest
Life is so unnerving
for a servant who's not serving
He's not whole without
a soul to wait upon
Get off!
Ah, those good old days
when we were useful
- Huh?
- Suddenly those good old days are gone
- Oh!
- Ten years we've been rusting
Needing so much more
than dusting
Needing exercise
A chance to use our skills
Most days wejust
lay around the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy
You walked in and upsy-daisy
It's a guest, it's a guest
Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed
With dessert, she'll want tea
And my dear, that's fine with me
While the cups do their soft-shoein'
I'll be bubblin', I'll be brewin'
I'll get warm, pipin'hot
Heaven sakes, is that a spot
Clean it up
We want the company impressed
We've got a lot to do
Is it one lump or two
- For you, our guest
- She's our guest
- She's our guest
- Be our guest
- Be our guest, be our guest
Our command is your request
- Let's go, people. Fun's over.
Over here. Line up.
It's ten years since we've had
anybody here and we're obsessed
With your meal, with your ease
Yes, indeed, we aim to please
While the candlelight's
still glowing
Let us help you
We'll keep going
Course by course
One by one
Till you shout
Enough, I'm done
Then we'll sing you off to sleep
as you digest
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up
Be our guest
Be our guest
Be our guest
Please be our
Guest
- Bravo! That was wonderful!
- Thank you.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!
My goodness, look at the time.
Now it's off to bed, off to bed.
Oh, I couldn't possibly
go to bed now.
It's my frst time
in an enchanted castle.
Enchanted!
Who said anything about
the castle being enchanted?
- It was you, wasn't it?
- I fgured it out for myself.
I'd like to look around,
if that's all right.
- Oh, would you like a tour?
- Wait a second. Wait a second.
I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.
We can't let her go poking around in
certain places, if you know what I mean.
Perhaps you'd like to take me.
I'm sure you know everything
there is to know about the castle.
Oh, well! Actually, l...
Yes, I do.
As you can see,
the pseudo-facade was stripped away...
to reveal
the minimalist rococo design.
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.
This is yet another example
of the late neoclassic Baroque period.
And, as I always say,
if it's not Baroque, don't fx it.
Where was I?
As you were!
Now, then, if I may draw your attention
to the flying buttresses above the...
Uh, mademoiselle?
- What's up there?
- Where? There? Oh, nothing.
Absolutely nothing of interest
at all in the west wing.
Dusty, dull, very boring.
Ah, so that's the west wing!
Nice going.
I wonder what
he's hiding up there.
- Hiding? The master is hiding nothing.
- Then it wouldn't be forbidden.
That's, uh, uh... Mademoiselle would,
uh, like to, uh, uh, see something else?
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...
- Maybe later.
- Uh, the... the gardens...
or, or the...
the library perhaps?
You have a library?
- Yes! Oh, indeed.
- With books.
- Scads of books!
- Mountains of books!
- Forests of books!
- Cascades!
- Cloudbursts!
- Swamps of books!
More books than you'll ever
be able to read in a lifetime.
Books on every subject
ever studied...
by every author
who ever set pen to paper.
By every author
who ever set pen to paper.
Oh, oh.
- Why did you come here?
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- I warned you never to come here!
- I didn't mean any harm.
Do you realize
what you could have done?
Please! Stop!
- Get out!
- No!
Get out!
- Where are you going?
- Promise or no promise...
I can't stay here
another minute.
No, wait, please!
Please wait!
No!
Here, now. Don't do that.
Just hold still.
- That hurts!
- If you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!
Well, if you hadn't have run away,
this wouldn't have happened.
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing!
Well, you should learn
to control your temper!
Now, hold still.
This might sting a little.
By the way, thank you
for saving my life.
You're welcome.
I don't usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night...
but he said you'd make it
worth my while.
- I'm listening.
- It's like this.
I've got my heart set
on marrying Belle.
But she needs a little persuasion.
Turned him down flat!
Everyone knows
her father's a lunatic.
He was in here tonight raving
about a beast in a castle.
Maurice is harmless.
The point is,
Belle would do anything...
to keep him
from being locked up.
Yeah, even marry him.
So you want me to throw her father
into the asylum...
unless she agrees to marry you.
Oh, that is despicable!
I love it!
If no one will help me,
then I'll go back alone!
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care what it takes!
I'll fnd that castle
and somehow, l...
I'll get her out of there.
- Belle! Maurice!
- Oh, well.
Guess it's not gonna work after all.
They have to come back sometime.
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.
Lefou, don't move from that spot...
until Belle
and her father come home.
But... But l...
Ah, nuts!
I've never felt this way
about anyone.
I want to do something
for her, but what?
Well, there's the usual things.
Flowers, chocolates,
promises you don't intend to keep.
Ah, no, no, it has to be
something very special.
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute!
Belle?
There's something
I want to show you.
But frst,
you have to close your eyes.
It's a surprise.
- Can I open them?
- No, no. N-Not yet.
Wait here.
- Now can I open them?
- All right. Now!
I can't believe it!
I've never seen so many books
in all my life.
- You... You like it?
- It's wonderful!
- Then it's yours.
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Would you look at that!
- I knew it would work.
What? What works?
- It's very encouraging.
- Isn't this exciting?
- I didn't see anything.
- Come along, Chip.
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.
There's something sweet
and almost kind
But he was mean
and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear
and so unsure
I wonder why
I didn't see it there before
She glanced this way
I thought I saw
And when we touched
she didn't shudder at my paw
No, it can't be
I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me
that way before
New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought
That this could be
True
That he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him
That I simply didn't see
- Well, who'd have thought
- Well, bless my soul
- Well, who'd have known
- Well, who indeed
And who'd have guessed
they'd come together on their own
- It's so peculiar, wait and see
- We'll wait a see
A few days more
There may be something there
that wasn't there before
There may be something there
that wasn't there before
You know, perhaps there is something
there that wasn't there before
What?
There may be something there
that wasn't there before
- What's there, Mama?
- Shh.
I'll tell you when you're older.
Right, then, you all know
why we're here.
We have exactly 12 hours,
36 minutes and 15 seconds...
to create the most magical,
spontaneous...
romantic atmosphere
known to man or beast.
Right. Need I remind you...
that as the last petal falls
from this rose...
the spell will never be broken!
Very well. You all know
your assignments.
Half of you to the west wing,
half of you to the east wing...
the rest of you,
come with me.
Lighten up, Cogsworth,
and let nature take its course.
It's obivious there's a spark
between them.
Yes, but there's no harm
in fanning the flames, you know...
a little.
Besides, they must fall in love tonight
if we ever expect to be human again.
- Ah, human again.
- Human again.
Yes, think what that means.
I'll be cooking again
Be good-looking again
With a mademoiselle
on each arm
When I'm human again
Only human again
Poised and polished
and gleaming with charm
I'll be courting again
Chic and sporting again
Which should cause
several husbands alarm
I'll hop down off this shelf
and tout suite be myself
I can't wait to be human again
Be human again
Only human again
We'll be knick-knacks
and what-nots no more
When we're human again
Good and human again
Oh, cherie,
we'll be only top drawer
I'll wear lipstick and rouge
and I won't be so huge
Why I'll easily fit through that door
I'll exude savoir faire
I'll wear gowns
I'll have hair
It's my birth
to be human again
When we're human again
Only human again
When the world once more
starts making sense
I'll unwind for a change
Really that would be strange
Can I help it if I'm t-t-tense
In a shack by the sea
I'll sit back sipping tea
Let my early retirement commence
Far from fools made of wax
I'll get down to brass tacks
- And relax
- When I'm human again
So sweep fast
round the floor
Let's let some light in the room
I can feel I can tell
Someone might break the spell
Any day now
Shine up the brass
on the door
Alert the dustbin and broom
If it all goes as planned
Our time may be at hand
Any day now
Open the shutters
and let in some air
Put these here
and put those over there
Sweep up the years
of sadness and tears
And throw them away
We'll be human again
Only human again
When the girl finally
sets us all free
Cheeks a-bloomin'again
We're assumin'again
We'll assume our long lost
joie de vivre
We'll be playin'again
Holidayin'again
And we're prayin'its'A.S.A.P.
We will push
We will shove
They will both fall in love
And we'll finally be human again
"There never was a story
of more woe
"Than this of Juliet
and her Romeo"
- Could you read it again?
- Here, why don't you read it to me?
Uh, all right.
- I can't.
- You mean, you never learned?
I learned... a little.
It's just been so long.
Well, here, I'll help you.
- Let's start here.
- Here.
- Okay. "Twoh..."
- "Two."
"Two." I knew that.
"Two households..."
We'll be dancing again
We'll be twirling again
We'll be whirling around
with such ease
When we're human again
Only human again
We'll go waltzing
those old one-two-threes
We'll be floating again
We'll be gliding again
Stepping, striding
As fine as you please
Like a real human does
I'll be all that I was
On that glorious morn
when we're finally reborn
And we're all of us human
Again
Tonight is the night.
- I'm not sure I can do this.
- You don't have time to be timid.
You must be bold, daring.
Bold! Daring!
There will be music,
romantic candlelight...
provided by myself.
And when the moment is right,
you confess your love.
Yes, I con...
I, l... No, I can't.
- You care for the girl, don't you?
- More than anything.
Well, then you must tell her.
Voila! Oh, you look so... so...
Stupid.
Not quite the word
I was looking for.
Perhaps a little more
off the top.
Your lady awaits.
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the beast
Everjust the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Everjust as sure
As the sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Shh.
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Off to the cupboard
with you now, Chip.
It's past your bedtime.
Good night, love.
Belle?
Are you happy here with me?
Yes.
What is it?
If only I could see my father again
Just for a moment.
I miss him so much.
There is a way.
This mirror
will show you anything...
anything you wish to see.
I'd like to see my father, please.
Papa! Oh, no!
He's sick. He may be dying,
and he's all alone.
- Then you-you must go to him.
- What did you say?
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.
You mean, I'm free?
- Yes.
- Oh, thank you.
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way.
Take it with you
so you'll always have a way...
to look back and remember me.
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.
Well, Your Highness, I must say...
everything is going
Just swimmingly.
I knew you had it in you.
I let her go.
Yes, yes, splen...
You what?
How could you do that?
- I had to.
- Yes, but, but, but... but why?
Because I love her.
He did what?
- Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
- She's going away?
But he was so close.
After all this time,
he's fnally learned to love.
That's it then.
That should break the spell!
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.
Now it's too late.
Papa? Papa?
They're back.
- Belle!
- Shh.
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.
I thought I'd never see you again.
- I missed you so much!
- But the beast...
- Did you... How did you escape?
- I didn't escape, Papa.
- He... He let me go.
- That horrible beast?
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.
- Hi!
- Oh, a stowaway.
Why, hello there, little fella.
Y... Didn't think I'd see you again.
Belle, why'd you go away?
Don't you like us any more?
Oh, Chip. Of course I do.
It's just that...
- May I help you?
- I've come to collect your father.
- My father?
- Don't worry, mademoiselle.
We'll take good care of him.
- My father's not crazy!
- He was raving like a lunatic!
- We all heard him, didn't we?
- Yes!
- No, I won't let you!
- Belle?
Maurice, tell us again, old man.
Just how big was the beast?
He was... I mean,
he was... he was, uh, enormous!
I'd... I'd say at least eight,
uh, no, more like ten feet!
Well, you don't get
much crazier than that!
It's true, I tell you!
- Get him out of here!
- Let go of me!
No! You can't do this!
Poor Belle.
Oh, it's a shame about your father.
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.
I might be able to clear up
this little misunderstanding if...
- If what?
- If you marry me.
- What?
- One little word, Belle.
- That's all it takes.
- Never!
- Have it your way!
- Belle? Let go of me!
My father's not crazy
and I can prove it!
Show me the beast.
- Is it dangerous?
- Oh, no, no, he'd never hurt anyone.
Please, l-I know he looks vicious,
but he's really kind and gentle.
- He's my friend.
- If I didn't know better...
I'd think you had feelings
for this monster.
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are!
She's as crazy as the old man!
The beast will make off
with your children.
- He'll come after them in the night.
- No!
We're not safe till his head
is mounted on my wall!
I say we kill the beast!
- We're not safe until he's dead
- He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children
to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village
if we let him wander free
So it's time
to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me
Through the mist, through the woods
through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare
but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something
truly terrible inside
It's a beast
He's got fangs, razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws
for the feast
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home
Till he's dead
Good and dead
- Kill the beast
- No, I won't let you do this.
If you're not with us,
you're against us.
- Bring the old man!
- Get your hands off me!
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature!
- Let us out!
- We'll rid the village of this beast!
- Who's with me?
- I am! I am!
- I am!
- Light your torch, mount your horse
Screw your courage
to the sticking place
We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way
Through a mist, to a wood
where within a haunted castle
Something's lurking
that you don't see every day
It's a beast
One as tall as a mountain
We won't rest
till he's good and deceased
Sally forth, tally-ho
Grab your sword and your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!
I have to warn the beast.
This is all my fault.
Oh, Papa, what are we going to do?
Now, now.
We'll think of something.
We don't like what we don't understand
In fact, it scares us
And this monster
is mysterious at least
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village
and our lives
We'll kill the beast
I knew it. I knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.
Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.
- Could it be?
- Is it she?
Sacrebleu! Invaders!
- Encroachers!
- And they have the mirror!
Warn the master. If it's a fght
they want, we'll be ready for them.
Who's with me?
Take whatever booty
you can fnd.
But remember,
the beast is mine!
Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger
just increased
Raise the flag, sing the song
Here we come 50 strong
And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong
Let's kill the beast
- Pardon me, Master.
- Leave me in peace.
But, sir,
the castle is under attack!
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
- This isn't working.
- Oh, Lumiere, we must do something!
Wait! I know!
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
What shall we do, Master?
It doesn't matter now.
Just let them come.
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
Now!
Yes!
Here we go!
What the devil?
Belle, look out!
You guys gotta try this thing.
Up here, you scurvy scum.
Now!
And stay out!
Get up!
Get up!
What's the matter, beast?
Too kind and gentle
to fght back?
No!
- Belle!
- No, Gaston, don't!
Let's go, Philippe.
Come on out and fght!
Were you in love with her,
beast?
Did you honestly think
she'd want you...
when she had someone like me?
It's over, beast!
Belle is mine!
Let me go! Let me go!
Please, don't hurt me.
I'll do anything. Anything!
Get out!
- Beast!
- Belle.
Belle?
You came back.
You... You came back.
Of course I came back.
I couldn't let them...
Oh, this is all my fault.
If only I'd gotten here sooner.
Maybe it's better...
it's better this way.
Don't talk like that.
You'll be all right.
We're together now. Everything's
going to be fne, you'll see.
At least...
I got to see you one last time.
No! No!
Please! Please!
Please don't leave me.
I love you.
Belle, it's me!
It is you!
Lumiere!
Cogsworth!
Mrs Potts!
- Look at us!
- Mama! Mama!
- Oh, my goodness!
- It is a miracle!
Ah, I'amour.
Well, Lumiere, old friend.
Shall we let bygones be bygones?
Of course, mon ami.
I told you she would break the spell.
I beg your pardon, old friend, uh,
but I believe I told you.
No, you didn't. I told you!
You most certainly did not,
you pompous, paraffn-headed peabrain!
En garde,
you-you overgrown pocket watch!
- Take that!
- Stop shoving.
Are they gonna live
happily ever after, Mama?
Of course, my dear.
Of course.
Do I still have to sleep
in the cupboard?

(Flynn narrates)
This is the story of how I died.
Don't worry, this is actually
a very fun story. And the truth is, it isn't even mine.
This is the story of a girl named,
Rapunzel.
And it starts, with the sun.
Now, once upon a time, a single
drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.
And from this small drop of sun,
grew a magic, golden, flower.
It had the ability to heal the sick,
and injured.
Oh, you see that old woman,
over there?
You might want to remember her.
She's kind of important.
Well, centuries pass and a hop
skip and a bump right away there grew a kingdom.
The kingdom was ruled by a beloved
King and Queen.
And the Queen, well she was about
to have a baby,
and she got sick,
really, sick.
She was running out of time.
And that's when people usually start
to look for a miracle.
Or in this case, a magic golden flower.
Ahhh, I told you she'd
be important.
You see instead of sharing the
suns gift,
this woman, Mother Gothel,
hoarded it's healing power
and used it to keep herself
young for hundreds of years.
And all she had to do,
was sing a special song.
Flower gleam and glow,
let your power shine
Make the clock reverse,
bring back what once was mine
What once was mine
All right, you get the jist. She sings
she turns young, creepy, right?
We've found it!
Flynn: The magic of the golden flower,
healed the queen.
A healthy baby girl,
a princess was born.
With beautiful golden hair.
I'll give you a hint.
That's Rapunzel.
To celebrate her birth, the King and
Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.
For that one moment,
everything was perfect.
And then that moment ended.
Flower, gleam and glow,
let your powers shine
Make the clock re...
HUH!
Gothel broke into the castle and stole
the child, just like that...gone.
The Kingdom searched and searched,
but they could not find the Princess.
But deep within the forest
In a hidden tower.
Gothel raised the child
as her own.
...bring back what was lost, what once
was mine, what once was mine.
Gothel had found her new magic flower.
But this time she was determined
to keep it hidden.
Why can't I go outside?
The outside world is a dangerous place.
Filled with horrible, selfish people.
-You must stay here, where you're safe.
Do you understand, flower?
-Yes, Mommy.
Flynn: But the walls of that tower,
could not hide everything.
Each year on her birthday, the King
and Queen released thousands of lanterns
into the sky.
In hope that one day, their lost
Princess, would return.
HAH!
Hmm, Well I guess Pascal's
not hiding out here.
(Chuckles)
GOTCHA!
That's twenty two for me.
How about twenty three,
out of forty five?
Okay, well, what do you want to do?
Yeah, I don't think so.
I like it in here and so do you.
Oh, come on Pascal, it's
not so bad in there.
TANGLED
7a.m. the usual morning line-up
Starting the chores I sweep
'til the floors all clean
Polish and wax, do laundry and
mop and shine up.
Sweep again, and by then
it's like 7:15.
So I'll read a book,
or maybe two or three.
Id add a few new paintings
to my gallery.
I'll play guitar, and knit, and cook
and basically.
Wonder when will my
life, begin.
Then after lunch, it's puzzles,
and darts and baking.
Papier-mch, a bit of ballet,
and chess.
Pottery, and ventriloquy, candle making.
Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch.
Take a climb, sew a dress, and I'll re-read the books.
If I have time to spare, I'll paint the wall
some more, I'm sure there's room somewhere.
And then I'll brush, and brush, and brush,
and brush my hair.
Stuck in the same place
I've always been.
And I'll keep wondering, and wondering,
and wondering...
Wondering, just when will my life begin?
Tomorrow night, the lights will appear.
Just like they do on my birthday,
each year.
What is it like out there,
where they glow?
Now that I'm older. Mother
might just let me go.
Wow!
I could get used to a view like this.
-Flynn, come on.
-Hold on.
Yep, I'm used to it.
Guys I want a castle.
We do this job, you could
buy your own castle.
(Sneezes)
Oh, hay fever?
Yeah.
Huh?
Wait, wait.
Hey, wait!
Can't you picture me in a castle of
my own?
I mean, I certainly can.
Oh, the things we've seen and
it's only eight in the morning.
Gentlemen, this is a very big day.
(sighs) This is it. This is
a very big day, Pascal.
(giggles) I'm finally going to do it.
-I'm going to ask her.
-RAPUNZEL!
Let down your hair.
It's time.
I know, I know. Come on, don't
let her see you.
Rapunzel, I'm not getting any
younger down here.
Coming, mother.
Hi, welcome home, mother.
Oh, Rapunzel. How you manage to do
that every single day,
without fail, it looks absolutely
exhausting, darling.
Oh, it's nothing.
Then I don't know why it
takes so long.
(Laughs)
Oh, darling. I'm just teasing.
All right...so, mother.
As you know tomorrow is a very big day.
Rapunzel look at that mirror.
You know what I see?
I see a strong, confident,
beautiful young lady.
Oh look, you're here too.
I'm just teasing, stop taking
everything so seriously.
Okay, so mother. I was thinking tomorrow...
Flower, mother's feeling a little run down.
Would you sing for me, dear?
-Then we'll talk.
-OH! Of course, mother.
(Sings very fast)
Flower gleam and glow, Let your power shine,
Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine.
Heal what has been hurt, Change the fate's design.
Save what has been lost, Bring back what once was mine.
-Rapunzel!
-So, mother,
Earlier I ask if tomorrow was a
pretty big day, and you didn't really respond,
So I'm just going to tell you.
It's my birthday!
TADA!
No, no, no can't be.
I distinctly remember. Your
birthday was last year.
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.
Mother, I'm turning eighteen.
And I wanted to ask,
what I really want for this birthday.
Actually what I want for every birthday...
Rapunzel please, stop with the mumbling.
You know how I feel about the mumbling.
Blah, blah, blah,...blah.
It's very annoying.
I'm just teasing, you're adorable
I love you so much, darling.
Oh, I want to see the floating lights.
-What?
-Oh,...
Well I was hoping you would
take me to see the floating lights.
Oh, you mean the stars.
That's the thing
I've charted stars and they're
always constant.
But these, they appear every year
on my birthday, Mother.
Only on my birthday.
And I can't help but feel that they're,
They're meant for me.
I need see them, Mother.
And not just from my window.
In person.
I have to know what they are.
You want to go outside?
Oh, why Rapunzel.
Look at you, as
fragile as a flower.
Still a little sapling, just a sprout.
-You know why we stay up in this tower
-I know, but...
Thats right, to keep you safe,
and sound, dear.
Guess I always knew this day was coming.
Know that soon you'd want
to leave the nest.
-Soon, but not yet. Shhh..
-But
Trust me pet,
Mother, knows best.
Mother knows best,
listen to your mother.
It's a scary world
out there.
Mother knows best.
One way or another, something
will go wrong, I swear.
Ruffians, thugs, poison Ivy,
quicksand.
Cannibals, and snakes,
the plague.
Also large bugs, men with pointy teeth.
And stop, no more,
you'll just upset me.
Mother's right here,
mother will protect you.
Darling here's what I suggest.
Skip the drama,
stay with Mama.
Mother, knows best.
Mother knows best.
Take it from your mumsey.
On your own, you won't survive.
Sloppy underdressed, immature, clumsy,
Please, they'll eat you up,
alive.
Gullible, nave,
positively grubby.
Ditzy and a bit,
well, hmm vague.
Plus I believe, getting
kinda chubby.
I'm just saying,
'Cause I wuv you.
Mother understands,
Mothers here to help you.
All I have is one request.
-Rapunzel?
-Yes?
Don't ever ask to
leave this tower, again.
Yes, Mother.
Ahh, I love you very much, dear.
I love you more.
I love you most.
Don't forget it.
You'll regret it.
Motherrrrrrr.
Knows best.
Rapunzel, I'll see you
in a bit, my flower.
I'll be here.
No, no no. This is bad, this is
very, very bad, This is really bad.
They just can't get my nose right.
Who cares.
Well it's easy for you to say.
You guys look amazing.
All right, okay. Give me a boost,
and I'll pull you up.
Give us the satchel first.
Wha..? I just...
I can't believe, that after all
we've been together,
you don't trust me.
Ouch.
Now help us up, pretty boy.
Sorry, my hands are full.
What?
RYDER!
Retrieve that satchel with any force.
We got him now, Maximus.
Go!
Heyah! Come flea-bag, forward.
No.
No, stop it.
HAH!
-AHHHHH!
-WHINNEYY!
(Sniffing)
(Horse whinnies in distance)
Alone at last.
(((CLANG!!!)))
Huh?
(((CLANG!!)))
Okay, okay, I got a person
in the closet.
I got a person in the closet.
I got a person in my closet!
To weak to handle myself
out there, huh Mother?
Well, Tell that to my pan here.
Rapunzel!
Let down your hair.
One moment, Mother.
I have a big surprise.
Uh, I do too.
Oh, I bet my surprise is bigger.
I don't think you got it.
I found my parsnips. I can always make
hazel nut soup for dinner, your favorite.
Surprise!
Well mother, there's something
I want to tell you.
Oh Rapunzel, you know I hate
leaving you after a fight.
Especially when I've done
absolutely nothing wrong.
Okay, I've been thinking a lot
about what you said, earlier.
I hope you're not still talking
about the stars.
Before you answer, yes
I'm leading up to that.
Because I really thought
we dropped the issue, sweetheart.
No Mother, I'm just saying,
you think I'm not strong enough
to handle myself out there.
Oh darling, I know you're not strong
enough to handle yourself out there.
-But if you just...
-Rapunzel, we're done talking about this.
-But trust me, I...
-Rapunzel.
-...know what I'm
-Rapunzel.
-Oh, come on.
-You have no other life, Rapunzel.
You are not leaving this tower,
EVER!
Oh, great. Now I'm the bad guy.
All I was gonna say, mother
is that...
I know what I want for my
birthday, now.
And what is that?
New paint. That paint made from
the white shells you once brought me.
Well that is a very long trip,
Rapunzel.
Almost three day's time.
I just thought it was a
better idea than, stars.
You sure you'll be all right,
on your own?
I know I'm safe, as long
as I'm here.
I'll be back in three days time.
I love you very much, dear.
I love you more.
I love you most.
Okay.
AHH!
Wha..?
Is this...hair?
Struggling...struggling is pointless.
I know why you're here.
And I'm not afraid of you.
What?
Who are you, and how
did you find me?
Ah hah.
Who are you, and how
did you find me?
(Clears throat)
I know not who you are.
Nor how I came to find you.
But may I just say.
Hi!
How you doing?
The names Flynn Ryder.
How's it going, huh?
Who else knows my location,
Flynn Ryder?
-All right, Blondie.
-Rapunzel.
Gesundheit, here's the thing.
I was in a situation,
Gallivanting through the forest.
I can across your tower and...
Ho, ho no, where is my satchel?
I hid it, somewhere you'll
never find it.
It's in the pot, isn't it.
(((Clang!!)))
Ahh, would you stop that.
Now it's hidden where you'll never find it.
So, what do you want,
with my hair?
-To cut it?
-What?
-Sell it?
-No!
Listen, the only thing I want
to do with your hair,
is to get out of it.
Literally.
Wait, you don't want my hair?
Why on earth would
I want your hair?
Look, I was being chased, I saw a
tower, I climbed it, end of story.
You're, telling the truth?
YES!
Hmmm.
I know, but he's someone
that can take me.
I think he's telling the truth.
Nothing I think,
but what choice do I have?
Uh, okay Flynn Ryder,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
-Deal?
-Look this way.
Do you know what these are?
You mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess?
Lanterns...
I knew they weren't stars.
Well, tomorrow evening
they will light the night sky,
with these lanterns.
You will act as my guide,
Take me to these lanterns,
and return me home safely.
Then, and only then, will
I return your satchel to you.
That is my deal.
Yeah, no can do.
Unfortunately, the kingdom and I
are not exactly, simpatico,
at the moment. So I
won't be taking you anywhere.
Something brought you here,
Flynn Ryder.
-Call it what you will, fate, destiny.
-A horse.
So I have made the decision to
trust you.
A horrible decision, really.
But trust me, when I tell you this.
You can tear this tower apart,
brick by brick.
but without my help, you will
never find your precious satchel.
(Clears throat)
Let me just get this straight.
I take you to see the lanterns.
Bring you back home.
and you'll give me back my satchel?
I promise.
And when I promise something, I never
ever break that promise.
EVER!
All right, listen, I didn't want
to have to want to do this,
but you leave me no choice.
Here comes the 'smolder'.
This is kind of an off day for me.
This doesn't normally happen.
Fine, I'll take you to see the lanterns.
Really!
-Ooops.
-You broke my 'smolder'.
You coming, Blondie?
Look at the world so close, and I'm
half way to it
Look at it all, so big
do I even dare?
I just have to do it.
Should I? No.
Here I go.
Just smell the grass, the dirt.
Just like I dreamed they'd be.
Just feel that summer breeze.
The way it's calling me.
For like the first time ever,
I'm completely free.
I could go running, and racing,
and dancing...
and chasing, and leaping
and bounding.
hair flying, heart pounding
and splashing and reeling.
And finally feeling,
Now's when my life
begins.
I can't believe I did this.
(Mumbles) I can't believe I did this.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS!
Mother will be so furious.
That's okay, what she doesnt
know won't kill her, right?
Oh my gosh, this will kill her.
THIS IS SO FUN!
I am a horrible person,
I'm going back.
I am never going
baaaccckkk!
I am a despicable human being.
WAHHOOOOO!
Best day, ever!
(Sobbing)
(Clears throat)
You know, I can't help but notice,
you seem a little at war
with yourself, here.
-Really?
-The whole day,
Bits and pieces.
Sort of protective mother,
forbidden road trip.
This is serious stuff.
But let me ease your conscious.
This is part of growing up.
A little rebellion, a little adventure.
That's good, healthy even.
(Laughs) You think?
I know. You're way over thinking
your stress meter.
Did your mother deserve it?
Will this break her heart
and crush her soul?
Well of course.
But you just got to do it.
Break her heart?
-It can.
-Crush her soul?
Like a grape.
She would be heart broken,
you're right.
Likely, all right, oh no.
All right, I can't believe I'm
saying this, but...
I'm letting you out of the deal.
-Well...
-That's right.
But don't make me. Let's
just turn around,
and you go home, and your frog.
I get back my satchel.
You get back a mother
daughter relationship.
based on mutual trust and
viola!
We part ways as unlikely friends.
-No, I am seeing those lanterns.
-Oh, come on!
What is it going to take
to get my satchel back?
I will use this.
What is it, ruffians, thugs?
Stay calm, it can probably smell fear.
Oh, sorry.
Getting just a little bit, jumpy.
Probably be best if we avoid
ruffians and thugs, though.
Yeah, that's probably best.
Are you hungry?
I know a great place for lunch.
-Where?
-Oh, don't you worry.
You'll know it when you smell it.
(Sniffing)
Oh, a Palace horse.
Where's your rider?
Rapunzel.
RAPUNZEL!
Rapunzel, let down your hair.
Rapunzel?
Oh no!
RAPUNZEL!
I know it's around here, somewhere.
Ah, there it is.
The Snuggly duckling.
Don't worry, very quaint place,
perfect for you.
Don't want you scaring, and giving
up on this endeavor now do we?
-Well, I do like duckling.
-YAY!
Garcon, your finest table, please.
You smell that?
Take a deep breath through the nose.
Really, it's pretty bad.
What are you getting?
Because to me, it's part bad smell.
and the other part is
really bad when it smells.
I don't know why, but overall,
it smells like the color brown.
You're in luck.
That's a lot of hair.
She's growing it out, is that blood
on your moustache?
Goldie, look at this, look at
all the blood on his moustache.
Look, I'm sure thats a lot of blood.
Hey, you don't look so good, Blondie.
Maybe we should get you home.
Call it a day.
Probably better off. This is a five
star joint after all.
And if you can't handle this place, well
maybe you should be back in your tower.
Is this you?
No, no this is being mean.
Oh, it's him all right.
Gretta, go find some guards.
That reward is going to
buy me a new hook.
I can use the money.
What about me?
I'm broke.
-Boys, stop!
-We can work this out.
Hey, leave him alone.
-Please.
-Give me back my guide.
Not the nose, not the nose,
not the nose!
Put him down!
Okay, I don't know where I am,
and I need him to take me to see the lanterns,
because I've been dreaming about
them my entire life.
Find your humanity.
Havent any of you ever had a dream?
I, had a dream.
Once.
I'm malicious mean and scary.
My sneer could curdle dairy.
And violence-wise my hands
are not the cleanest.
But despite my evil look,
and my temper and my hook.
I've always yearned to
be a concert pianist.
Can't cha see me on the stage
performing Mozart.
Tickling the ivories,
'til they gleam.
Yep, I'd rather be called deadly.
For my killer show-tune medley.
Thank you.
'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream.
He's got a dream,
he's got a dream.
See, I ain't as cruel and
vicious as I seem.
Though I feel like breaking femurs.
You can count me with the dreamers.
Like everybody else,
I've gotta dream.
I've got scars and lumps and bruises.
Plus there's something here that oozes.
Let's not even mention
my complexion.
But despite my extra toes.
And my goiter and my nose.
I really want to make a love
connection.
Can't you see me with a special
little lady.
Rowing in a row boat,
down the stream.
Though I'm one disgusting blighter.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.
'Cause way down deep
inside, I gotta dream.
I gotta dream,
I gotta dream.
And I know one day
will never reign supreme.
Though my face leaves
people screaming.
There's a child behind
it dreaming.
Like everybody else,
I've gotta dream.
Tor would like to quit
and be a florist.
Gunther does interior design.
Ulf is into mime,
Attilas cupcakes are sublime.
Bruiser knits, Killer sews.
Fang does little puppet shows.
And Vladimir collects
ceramic unicorns.
What about you?
-I'm sorry me?
-What's your dream?
No, no, no. Sorry boys,
I don't sing.
I have dreams like you,
no really.
Just much less, touchy-feely.
They mainly happen somewhere
warm and sunny.
On an island that I own,
tanned and rested and alone.
Surrounded by enormous
piles of money.
-I had a dream...I had a dream.
-(Thugs) Shes got a dream.
I just want to see the floating
lanterns gleam.
And with every passing hour.
I'm so glad I left my tower.
Like all you lovely folks,
I've got a dream.
She's gotta dream, He's gotta dream.
They've gotta dream, we've gotta dream.
So our differences ain't
really that extreme. We're one big team.
Call us brutal or sadistic
and grotesquely optimistic.
'Cause way down deep inside,
we've gotta dream.
We gotta dream,
I gotta dream.
Yes everybody here has got a...
Dreeeeeeaaaaamm.
Yeah!
I found the guards.
Where's Ryder,
where is he?
I know he's in here somewhere.
Find him, turn the place
upside down!
Go, live your dream.
I will.
Your dream stinks,
I was talking to her.
Thanks for everything.
I believe this is the man
you're looking for.
You got me.
Sir, there's no sign of Ryder.
Maximus.
What he's doing?
A passage, come on men,
let's go.
Corman, make sure those
boys don't get away.
Play it safe.
We'll go get the crown.
I gotta dream,
I got some dream.
Hi, ohhh, somebody get me a glass.
'Cause I just found me a
tall drink of water.
Oh stop it, you big lug.
Where's that tunnel lead out?
Knife!
Well, that got us safe.
Didn't know you had that in you
back there.
I KNOW!
I know...
Sooo, Flynn.
Where are you from?
Whoa, whoa, sorry Blondie,
I don't do that story.
However I am becoming very
interested in yours.
Now I...I know I'm not suppose
to mention the hair.
-Nope.
-Or, the Mother.
-Uh, uh.
-Frankly I'm to scared to
ask about the frog.
-Chameleon.
-Gila monster.
Here's my question, if you want
to see the lanterns so badly,
why haven't you gone before?
Uhh, hey, well...
Uh, Flynn...
Flynn!
Who's that?
They don't like me.
-Who's that?
-They don't like me either.
-Who's that?
-Lets just assume for the moment,
that everyone here doesn't like me.
Here.
I've waited a long time for this.
Oh mama, I have got to get me
one of these.
HAH!
You should know that this is
the bravest thing I've ever done.
How 'bout two out of three?
Flynn!
Flynn, look out.
You should see your faces.
'Cause you look...
Ridiculous
Come on, Blondie.
Jump.
It's no use,
I can't see anything.
Hey, there's no point.
It's pitch black down there.
This is all my fault.
She was right, I never
should have done this.
I'm so...
I'm so sorry, Flynn.
Eugene.
What?
My real name is,
Eugene Fitzherbert.
So you might as well know.
I have magic hair that glows
when I sing.
What?
I have magic hair,
that glows when I sing.
Flower gleam and glow.
Let your power shine.
We made it.
Your hair glows.
I'm alive.
I'm alive!
Never seen that coming.
Her hair actually glows.
-Eugene...
-Why does her hair glow?
-Eugene!
-What?
It doesn't just glow.
Why is he smiling at me?
I'll kill him.
I'll kill that, Ryder.
Better off to kill him.
Get back the crown, come on.
Boys.
Perhaps you want to stop acting
like wild dogs chasing their tails,
and think for a moment.
Oh, please there's no
need for that.
Well if that's all you desire,
then be on your way.
I was going to offer you something
worth one thousand crowns,
would have made you
rich beyond belief.
And that wasn't even the best part.
Oh well, C'est la vie.
Enjoy your crown.
What's the best part?
It comes with revenge
for Flynn Ryder.
So you're being strangely cryptic as you wrap
your magic hair around my injured hand.
-(Grunts in pain)
-Sorry.
Just don't...don't freak out.
Flower gleam and glow
Let your powers shine
Make the clock reverse
Bring back what once was mine.
Heal what has been hurt.
Change the fates design.
Save what has been lost.
Bring back what once was mine.
What once was mine.
-Ahhh!
-Don't freak out.
-(Stifled)Ahhh. I'm not freaking out,
are you freaking out?
Oh that's very interesting hair.
In the back of me, why is it possessed?
It's..how long has it been doing that?
Forever, I guess.
Mother said when I was a baby
people tried to cut it.
They wanted to take it for themselves.
But, once it's cut.
It turns brown, and looses it's power.
A gift like that, it has to be protected.
That's why Mother never let me...
That's why I...I never left the...
You never left that tower.
And you're still gonna go back?
No...yes.
It's complicated.
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?
Ah yeah, well. I'll spare
you the sob story of
poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert, it's
a little bit ah...
It's a little bit of a downer.
There was this book.
A book I used to read every
night to all the younger kids.
The tales of Flynnigan Ryder.
Swashbuckling rogue,
richest man alive.
Not bad with the ladies. I...nothing
to brag about, of course.
Was he a thief too?
Ahh, well no.
Actually, he had enough
money to do whatever he wanted to do.
He could go anywhere that
he wanted to go.
And...and, for a kid,
with nothing.
I don't know, I...
It just seemed like a better option.
You can't tell anyone,
about this, okay?
It could ruin my whole reputation.
Ahh, you wouldn't want that.
Oh, the thing about a reputation,
it's all that a man has.
Um, well I should uh...
I, I should get some
more firewood.
Hey.
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert
much better than, Flynn Ryder.
Well, then you'd be the first.
But, thank you.
Well, I thought he'd never leave.
Mother?
Hello, dear.
But I...I..., was going to...
How did you find me?
Oh, it was easy really.
I just listened to the sound of
complete and utter betrayal,
and followed that.
-Mother...
-We're going home, Rapunzel.
-Now.
-You...You don't understand.
I've been on the most incredible journey.
I've seen and learned so much.
I even met someone.
Yes, the wanted thief.
I'm so proud.
-Come on, Rapunzel.
-Mother, wait.
I think
I think he likes me.
Likes you? Please, Rapunzel,
that's demented.
-But mother, I...
-This is why you never should have left.
Dear this whole romance that
you've invented,
just proves you're to naive to be here.
Why a kid like you?
Come on now, really.
Look at you, that face,
that ancient dress.
Do be a darling, come with mommy.
Mother...
-NO!
-No?
No.
I see how it is.
Rapunzel, knows best.
Rapunzel's so mature, now.
Such a clever grown up, miss.
Rapunzel knows best.
Fine, if you're so sure now.
Go ahead then give him, THIS!
How could you.
This is why he's here.
Don't let him deceive you.
Give it to him, watch, you'll see.
-I trust him.
Trust me my dear, that's
how fast he'll leave you.
I won't say I told you so...no.
Rapunzel knows best.
So if he's such a dream boat.
Go and put him, to the test.
-Mother, wait.
If he's lying, don't come
crying.
Mother, knows best.
So, hey uh,
can I ask you something?
Is there any chance that I'm going
to get super strength in my hand?
Because I'm not going to lie.
That would be stupendous.
Hey, you all right?
Oh, sorry, yes.
Just um, lost in thought,
I guess.
I mean because here's the thing.
Superhuman good looks,
I've always had 'em.
Born with it, but superhuman strength?
Imagine the possibilities, I'm just...
Patience boys. All good things
to those who wait.
Hmm, what?
Well I hope you're
here to apologize.
AHHHH!
No, no put me down.
No, no!
-Release him.
-OW!
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy boy, easy,
calm down.
Easy boy.
Easy.
That's it.
Now sit.
Sit.
Good, now drop the boot.
Drop it.
Oh, you are such a good boy.
Yes you are.
You all tired, chasing the bad
man all over the place?
Excuse me.
Nobody appreciates
you, do they?
Do they?
Come one, he's a bad horse.
Aw, he's nothing but
a big sweetheart.
Isn't that right?
Maximus.
You've got to be
kidding me.
Look, today is kinda the
biggest day of my life.
And I need, I need you
not to get him arrested.
Just for twenty four hours and then,
you can chase each other to
your hearts content.
Okay?
And it's also my birthday.
Just so you know.
(Mouths) WOW
Sorry.
Thank you.
It's the lost Princess.
Take a bow.
Hey Max.
What? I brought them.
Most of them.
Where are we going?
Well, best day of your life.
I figured you should have
a decent seat.
You okay?
I'm terrified.
Why?
I've been looking out the
window for eighteen years.
Dreaming about what it would feel
like when those lights rise in the sky.
What if it's not everything
that I dreamed it would be?
It will be.
And what if it is?
What then?
Well that's the good part,
I guess.
You get to go find a new dream.
All those days
Watching from the windows.
All those years
Outside looking in
All that time
Never even knowing
Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here
Blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here
Suddenly I see
Standing here
It's oh, so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be
And at last, I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last, I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once
Everything looks different
Now that I see you
I have something for you, too.
I should have given it to you
before, but I was just scared.
The thing is,
I'm not scared anymore.
You know what I mean?
I'm starting to.
All those days
Chasing down a daydream
All those years
Living in a blur
All that time
Never truly seeing
Things the way they were
Now she's here
Shining in the starlight
Now she's here
Suddenly I know
If she's here
It's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go
And at last, I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last, I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once
Everything is different
Now that I see you.
Now that I see you.
Is everything okay?
Huh? Oh yes.
Uh, yes of course.
I just...
I'm sorry, everything is fine.
There's just something I
have to take care of.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
It's all right, Pascal.
Ahh, there you are.
I've been searching everywhere for
you guys. Since we got separated.
Hey the sideburns are coming
in nice, huh?
You gotta be excited about that.
Anyhow, just wanted to say,
I shouldn't have split.
The crown is all yours.
I'll miss you, but I think
its for the... best.
Holding out on us again?
Hey, Ryder?
-What?
-We heard you found something.
Something much more valuable
than a crown.
We want her, instead.
I was starting to think you
ran off with the crown and left me.
He did.
What?
No.
He wouldn't
See for yourself.
Eugene?
Eugene!
Fair trade.
A crown, for the girl
with the magic hair.
How much do you think someone
will pay to stay young and healthy forever?
No, please.
NO!
NO!
Rapunzel!
Mother?
Oh, my precious girl.
Mother.
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
-How did you?
-I was so worried about
you dear.
So I followed you.
And I saw them attack you.
Let's go, let's go
before they come to.
You were right, mother.
You were right about everything.
I know darling.
I know.
Look!
The crown.
Rapunzel.
RAPUNZEL!
Wait, wait, wait.
Guys, guys.
Rapunzel!
Let's get this over with, Ryder.
Where are we going?
Oh...
There, it never happened.
Now, wash up for dinner.
I'm making hazel nut soup.
I really did try, Rapunzel.
I tried to warn you,
what was out there.
The world is dark, and selfish,
and cruel.
If it finds even the slightest
ray of sunshine.
It destroys it.
How did you know about her?
Tell me, now!
It wasn't us.
It was the old lady.
Old lady?
Wait, no, wait!
You don't understand,
she's in trouble.
Wait!
Rapunzel?
Rapunzel, what's going on up there?
Are you all right?
(Mumbles)
I'm the lost princess.
Please, speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.
I am the lost Princess.
Aren't I?
Did I mumble, Mother?
Or should I even call you that?
Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?
Why would you ask such
a ridiculous question?
It was you!
It was all, you.
Everything I did, was to protect you.
-Rapunzel.
-I spent my entire life.
Hiding from people who
would use me for my power.
-Rapunzel!
-I should have been hiding.
From you.
Where will you go?
He won't be there for you.
What did you do to him?
That criminal, is to
be hanged for his crimes.
-No.
-Now, now. It's all right.
Listen to me.
All of this is as
it should be.
NO!
You were wrong about the world.
And you were wrong about me.
And I will never let you
use my hair, again!
You want me to be the bad guy?
Fine.
Now I'm the bad, guy.
What's this?
Open up.
What's the password?
-What?
-Nope.
Open this door.
Not even close.
You have three seconds
One...
Two...
Three...
(((Clang!)))
Fry pans.
Who knew, right?
(ROARS!)
(Screams like girls)
-Head down?
-Head down.
-Thumbs in?
-Thumbs in.
-Knees apart?
-Knees apart.
Knees apart?
Why do I need to keep my...
AHHHHHHHH!
Max.
You brought them here?
Thank you.
No really, thank you.
Uh, I feel maybe this whole time
we've just misunderstanding one another.
And we really just, yeah
your right. We should go.
Max!
WHOAAAAA!
Okay Max, lets see how
fast you can run.
Rapunzel.
Rapunzel, let down your hair.
Rapunzel, I thought I'd never
see you again.
Now look what you've done,
Rapunzel.
Oh don't worry dear.
Our secret will die with him.
And as for us?
We are going where no one
will ever find you, again.
Rapunzel, really.
Enough all ready.
Stop fighting me.
NO! I won't stop.
For every minute of the rest
of my life I will fight.
I will never stop trying
to get away from you.
But, if you let me save him...
I will go with you.
(Moan) No.
No, Rapunzel.
I'll never run, I'll never
try to escape.
Just let me heal him. And
you and I will be together.
Forever, just like you want.
Everything will be
the way it was.
I promise.
Just like you want.
Just let me heal him.
In case you get any ideas
about following us.
Eugene!
Oh, I'm so sorry.
-Everything is going to okay, in a moment.
-No, Rapunzel!
-I promise, you have to trust me.
-No..
I can't let you do this.
But I can't let you die.
-But if you do this.
-Shhh.
-Then you...will die.
-Hey.
It's gonna be all right.
Rapunzel, wait...
Eugene, what...?
NOOO!
No...NO!
What have you done?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!
No, no, no,
NOOO!
No, no, no, no, Eugene.
Oh, look at me, look I'm right here.
Don't go, stay with me, Eugene.
Flower gleam and glow,
Let your powers shine
Make the clock reverse,
bring back what once was mine.
-Rapunzel...
-What?
You were my new dream.
And you were mine.
Heal what has been hurt.
Change the fates design.
Save what has been lost.
Bring back what once was mine.
What once was mine.
Rapunzel?
Eugene.
Did I ever tell you, I've
got a thing for brunettes?
(Eugene narrates)
Well, you could imagine what
happened next.
The kingdom rejoiced.
The lost Princess had returned.
The party lasted an entire week.
And, honestly I don't
remember much of it.
Dreams came true
all over the place.
That guy went on to become the
most famous concert pianist in the world.
And this guy? Well he eventually
found some to love.
As for this guy, well,
I assume he's happy.
He can't be proved otherwise.
Thanks to Maximus, crime in the kingdom
disappeared almost over night.
As did most of the apples.
Pascal, never changed.
At last Rapunzel was home,
and she finally had a real family.
She was a Princess worth
waiting for.
But above all, she led her kingdom
with all the grace and wisdom that
her parents did before her.
And as for me, well.
I started going by Eugene again.
Stopped thieving, basically
turned it all around.
But I know what the big question is.
Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?
Well I'm pleased to tell you.
After years, and years of asking,
and asking, and asking.
I finally said yes.
Rapunzel: Eugene
All right, I asked her.
Rapunzel:
Will we live happily ever after?
Yes, we will.
All right, everyone! This... is a stickup!
Don't anybody move!
Now, empty that safe!
Ooh-hoo-hoo! Money, money, money!
Stop it! Stop it,
you mean, old potato!
Quiet, Bo Peep,
or your sheep get run over!
Help! Baa!
Help us!
Oh, no, not my sheep!
Somebody do something!
Reach for the sky!
Oh, no! Sheriff Woody!
I'm here to stop you,
One-Eyed Bart.
Doh!
How'd you know it was me?
Are you gonna
come quietly?
You can't touch me, Sheriff!
I brought my attack dog
with the built-in force field
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.
- Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!
You're going to jail, Bart!
Say good-bye to the wife and later tots.
You saved the day again, Woody.
You're my favorite deputy.
# You've got a friend in me #
# You've got a friend in me #
Come on, let's
wrangle up the cattle.
# When the road looks
rough ahead #
# And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed #
- Round 'em up, cowboy!
- # Just remember
what your old pal said #
# Boy, you've got
a friend in me #
- Yee-haw!
-# Yeah, you've got a friend in me #
Hey, cowboy!
# Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am #
-# Big and stronger too #
- Come on, Woody.
-# Maybe #
# But none of them will ever
love you the way I do #
-# It's me and you, boy #
-# And as the years go by #
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
-# Our friendship will never die #
- Whoo!
-# You're gonna see #
-# It's our destiny #
-# You've got a friend in me #
- All right!
-# Yeah, you've got a friend in me #
- Score!
-# You got a friend in me #
- Wow! Cool!
- What do you think?
- Oh, this looks great, Mom!
- Okay, birthday boy-
- We saw that at the store!
I asked you for it!
- I hope I have enough places.
- Wow, look at that! That's so--
- One, two- Four. Yeah,
I think that's gonna be enough.
- Oh, my gosh, you got--
- Could we leave this up till we move?
- Well, sure!
- We can leave it up. Now go get Molly.
- Yeah!
- Your friends are gonna
be here any minute.
- Okay. It's party time, Woody.
- Yee...haw!
Howdy, little lady.
Somebody's poisoned
the water hole.
- Come on, Molly.
Oh, you're getting heavy.
- See you later, Woody.
Pull my string!
The birthday party's today?
Okay, everybody,
coast is clear!
- Ages 3 and up. It's on my box.
Ages 3 and up. I'm not supposed
to be baby-sitting Princess Drool.
- Hey, Hamm.
- Look, I'm Picasso!
- I don't get it.
You uncultured swine! What're
you lookin' at, ya hockey puck?
- Hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
- Sir! No, sir!
Okay. Hey, thank you. At ease.
Right here, Woody.
I'm red this time.
- No. S-Slink-
- Oh, well, all right.
You can be red if you want.
- N-Not now, Slink. I got some bad news.
- Bad news?
Shh, shh, shh!
- Just gather everyone up
for a staff meeting, and be happy.
- Got it.
- Be happy!
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!
- Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, Robot, podium please.
Hey.
Hey, Etch. Draw!
- Oh! Got me again.
Etch, you've been working
on that draw. Fastest knobs in the west.
Got a staff meeting, you guys.
Come on, let's go.
Now, where is that-- Oh.
Hey, who moved my doodle pad
way over here?
- How're you doin', Rex?
- Were you scared? Tell me honestly.
I was close to being scared that time.
I'm going for fearsome here,
but I just don't feel it.
I think I'm just
coming off as annoying.
Owl Oh, hi, Bo. Hi.
I wanted to thank you, Woody,
for saving my flock.
Oh, hey,
it was, uh, nothin'.
What do you say I get someone else
to watch the sheep tonight?
Oh, yeah!
Remember, I'm just
a couple of blocks away.
- Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
- Come on, come on.
Smaller toys up front.
Hey, Woody, come on.
- Ahem!
- Oh, thanks, Mike.
- Okay- Whoa, whoa. Step back.
- For crying out loud.
- Thank you.
- Hello? Check.
That better? Great.
Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf,
can you hear me? Great.
Okay. First item today:
Uh... oh, yeah.
Has everyone picked a moving buddy?
- What?
- Moving buddy? You can't be serious.
I didn't know we were
supposed to have one already.
- Do we have to hold hands?
You guys think
this is a big joke.
We've only got one week
left before the move.
I don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.
If you don't have one,
get one!
All right, next.
Uh, oh, yes.
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion
awareness meeting...
was, I think,
a big success.
And we wanna thank Mr. Spell
for putting that on for us.
- Thank you, Mr. Spell.
- You're welcome.
Okay. Uh, oh, yes.
One, uh, minor note here.
Andy's birthday party
has been moved to today.
- Wait a minute here!
What do you mean the party's today?
His birthday's not till next week!
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losin' her marbles?
Well, obviously she wanted to
have the party before the move.
- I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.
- Of course Woody ain't worried.
He's been Andy's favorite
since kindergarten.
Hey, hey.
Come on, Potato Head.
If Woody says it's all right, then,
well, darn it, it's good enough for me.
Woody has never
steered us wrong before.
Come on, guys. Every Christmas
and birthday we go through this.
But what if Andy gets
another dinosaur, a mean one?
I just don't think I could take
that kind of rejection!
Hey, listen,
no one's getting replaced.
This is Andy
we're talking about.
It doesn't matter
how much we're played with.
What matters is that we're here
for Andy when he needs us.
That's what we're
made for, right?
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff
meeting, but... they're here!
Birthday guests
at three o'clock!
- Stay calm, everyone!
Hey!
- Uh, meeting adjourned.
Ho, boy! Will you take a look
at all those presents?
I can't see a thing.
Yes, sir, we're next month's
garage sale fodder for sure.
- Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
- Oh, for crying out loud.
They're all in boxes, you idiot.
They're getting bigger.
- Wait, there's a nice
little one over there.
- Hi!
- Spell: trash can.
- We're doomed!
All right! All right!
If I send out the troops,
will you all calm down?
- Yes! Yes! We promise!
- Okay! Save your batteries.
Very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.
Sergeant, establish
a recon post downstairs. Code Red!
- You know what to do.
- Yes, sir!
All right, men.
You heard him. Code Red!
Repeat, we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!
Let's move!
Move, move, move, move!
- Yeah!
- Okay, come on, kids.
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.
All right, gangway, gangway.
And this is
how we find out...
- what is in those presents.
Okay, who's hungry?
Here come the chips!
I've got Cool Ranch
and barbecue! Ow!
What in the world-- Oh!
- I thought I told him to pick these up.
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.
G-G-Go on without me!
J-Just go!
A good soldier never
leaves a man behind.
- Okay, everybody, come on.
Everybody settle down.
Now, kids. Everybody-
You sit in a circle. No, Andy.
Andy, you sit in the middle there.
- Good. And- Which present
are you gonna open first?
- Mine!
- There they are.
Come in,
Mother Bird. This is Alpha Bravo.
- This is it! This is it!
Quiet, quiet, quiet!
- Come in, Mother Bird.
Andy's opening the first present now.
Mrs. Potato Head! Mrs. Potato Head!
Mrs. Potato Head!
Hey, I can dream,
can't I?
The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.
It's a- It's-
It's a- a lunch box.
- We've got a lunch box here.
- A lunch box?
- Lunch box?
- For lunch.
Okay, second present.
It appears to be--
- Okay, it's bed sheets.
- Who invited that kid?
Oh! Only one left.
- Okay, we're on the last present now.
- Last present!
It's a big one.
It's a--
- It's a board game!
Repeat, Battleship!
- Whew!
- Hallelujah!
- Yeah! All right!
- Hey, watch it!
Sorry there,
old spud head.
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.
So did I tell ya?
Huh? Nothin' to worry about.
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted ya for a second.
Wait a minute. Oh!
- What do we have here?
- Wait! Turn that thing back on!
Come in, Mother Bird!
Come in, Mother Bird!
Mom has pulled a surprise
present from the closet.
Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.
- Mom, what is it?
- It's a huge package.
Oh, get outta the-- One of the kids
is in the way. I can't see.
- It's a--
- Wow!
- It's a what? What is it?
- Oh, no!
- Oh, ya big lizard!
- Now we'll never know what it is!
- Way to go, Rex!
- No, no! Turn him around!
Turn him around!
- He's puttin' 'em in backwa-
Here, you're
puttin' 'em in backwards!
Plus is positive, minus is negative!
Oh, let me!
- Let's go to my room, guys!
Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!
- There!
- Juvenile intrusion!
Repeat, resume
your positions now!
Andy's coming! Everybody,
back to your places! Hurry!
Get to your places!
Get to your places!
- Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come!
Hey, look,
its lasers light up. Take that, Zurg!
Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!
- What is it?
- Can you see it?
- What the heck is up there?
- Woody, who's up there with ya?
- Woody?
- What are you doing under the bed?
- Uh, nothin'. Uh, nothin'.
I'm sure Andy was just
a little excited, that's all.
Too much cake and ice cream,
I suppose. It's just a mistake!
Well, that mistake is sitting
in your spot, Woody.
Have you been replaced? -
What did I tell you earlier?
No one is getting replaced
Now, let's all be polite and give
whatever it is up there...
a nice, big
Andy's-room welcome.
- Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
Come in, Star Command.
- Star Command, come
in. Do you read me?
Why don't they answer?
My ship!
Blast! This'll take
weeks to repair.
Buzz Lightyear mission log,
stardate 4-0-7-2.
My ship has run off course
en route to sector 12.
I've crash-landed
on a strange planet.
The impact must've awoken me
from hypersleep.
Terrain seems
a bit unstable.
No readout yet
if the air is breathable.
And there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.
- Hello!
Whoa! H-Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to.
- Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody.
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.
And also, there has been
a bit of a mix-up.
This is my spot, see,
the bed here.
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.
My ship has crash-landed
here by mistake.
Yes, it is a mistake because,
you see, the bed here is my spot.
I need to repair
my turbo boosters.
Do you people still use fossil fuel, or
have you discovered crystallic fusion?
- Well, let's see. We got double-A's.
Watch yourself!
Halt! Who goes there?
Don't shoot!
It's okay. Friends.
- Do you know these life-forms?
- Yes! They're Andy's toys.
All right, everyone,
you're clear to come up.
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.
Oh, I'm so glad
you're not a dinosaur!
Bye, bye. Thank you!
Now, thank you all
for your kind welcome!
- Say, what's that button do?
- I'll show you.
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
- Oh!
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string.
- Only it's--
- Only it sounds like a car ran over it.
Oh, yeah, but not like this.
This is a quality sound system.
Probably all
copper wiring, huh?
So, uh, where you from?
Singapore? Hong Kong?
Well, no. Actually, I-I'm stationed up
in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.
As a member of the elite
Universe Protection Unit
of the Space Ranger Corps,
I protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion...
from the evil Emperor Zurg,
sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.
I'm actually from a smaller company that
was purchased in a leveraged buyout.
You'd think they'd never seen
a new toy before.
Well, sure. Look at him. He's got more
gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah! Please be careful.
You don't want to be in the way
when my laser goes off.
Hey, a laser! How come
you don't have a laser, Woody?
It's not a laser! It's a-
It's a little light bulb that blinks.
- What's with him?
- Laser envy.
All right, that's enough!
- Look, we're all very impressed
with Andy's new toy.
- Toy?
T-O-Y. Toy!
Excuse me, l-l think the word
you're searching for is "Space Ranger."
The word I'm searching for I can't say
because there's preschool toys present.
Gettin' kinda tense,
aren't ya?
Uh, Mr. Lightyear,
uh, now, I'm curious.
What does a Space Ranger
actually do?
He's not a Space Ranger!
- He doesn't fight evil
or, or shoot lasers or fly!
- Excuse me.
- Ooh!
- Oh, impressive wingspan! Very good!
Oh, what? What?
These are plastic. He can't fly!
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy,
and I can fly.
- No, you can't.
- Yes, lean.
- You can't.
- Can.
- Can't. Can't. Can't!
- I tell you, I could fly around
this room with my eyes closed!
- Okay, then, Mr. Light Beer, prove it.
- All right, then, I will.
Stand back, everyone!
To infinity and beyond!
- Can!
- Whoa!
- Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!
- I found my movin' buddy.
- Thank you. Th-Thank you all. Thank you.
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.
Man, the dolls must really
go for you. Can you teach me that?
Golly bob howdy!
- Oh, shut up!
You know, in a couple of days,
everything will be just
the way it was. They'll see.
- They'll see.
I'm still Andy's favorite toy.

Hey, who's got my hat?
Look, I'm Woody! Howdy, howdy, howdy!
Ah-ha!Ah-ha, ha, ha!
Gimme that!
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog,
let me show you something.
It looks as though I've been
accepted into your culture.
- Your chief, Andy,
inscribed his name on me.
- Wow!
With permanent ink too!
Well, I must get back
to repairing my ship.
Don't let it
get to you, Woody.
Uh... let what? I don't, uh-
What do you mean? Who?
I know Andy's
excited about Buzz.
But you know he'll always have
a special place for you.
- Yeah, like the attic.
- All right, that's it!
- Hmm. Unidirectional bonding strip.
Mr. Lightyear
wants more tape.
Hmm?
Listen, Light Snack,
you stay away from Andy.
He's mine, and no one
is taking him away from me.
- What are you talking about?
Where's that bonding strip?
And another thing:
Stop with this spaceman thing!
- It's getting on my nerves!
- Are you saying you wanna lodge
a complaint with Star Command?
Oh-ho, okay! Ooh, well, so you wanna
do it the hard way, huh?
- Don't even think about it, cowboy.
- Oh, yeah, tough guy?
The air isn't...toxic.
How dare you open a spaceman's helmet
on an uncharted planet!
My eyeballs could've been
sucked from their sockets!
You actually think
you're the Buzz Lightyear?
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!
You're mocking me,
aren't you?
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Buzz, look, an alien!
- Where?
Yes!
- Whoa!
- Uh-oh.
- It's Sid!
- Don't move!
- I thought he was at summer camp.
- They must've kicked him out
early this year.
- Oh, no, not Sid!
- Incoming!
- Who is it this time?
- I--I can't--I can't tell.
Hey, where's Lenny?
- Right here, Woody.
- Oh, no, I can't bear
to watch one of these again.
Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.
- What's going on?
- Nothing that concerns
you spacemen; just us toys.
I'd better
take a look anyway.
- Why is that soldier
strapped to an explosive device?
That's why: Sid.
- Hmm, sure is a hairy fellow.
No, no, that's Scud,
you idiot.
- That is Sid.
- You mean that happy child?
- That ain't no happy child.
He tortures toys,
just for fun!
Well, then we've got
to do something.
What are you doing?
Get down from there!
- I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
- Yeah, sure. You go ahead.
- Melt him with your scary laser.
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!
- Lookout!
- Yes! He's gone! He's history!
- Whoo!
- I could've stopped him.
Buzz, I would love
to see you try.
Of course, I'd love
to see you as a crater.
- The sooner we move, the better.
Yeah!
To infinity and beyond!
All this packing
makes me hungry.
- What would you say to dinner
at, oh, Pizza Planet?
- Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!
Go wash your hands,
and I'll get Molly ready.
- Can I bring some toys?
- You can bring one toy.
- Just one?
- One toy?
- Hmm.
- Will Andy pick me?
"Don't count on it"?
Mmm!
Buzz! Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear.
Buzz Lightyear,
thank goodness. We've got trouble!
- Trouble? Where?
- Down there. Just down there.
A helpless toy, it's-
it's trapped, Buzz!
Then we've
no time to lose.
- I don't see anything!
- Oh, he's there!
Just, just keep looking!
- What kind of toy--
Oh! Whoa, whoa! Oh!
- Buzz!
Buzz!
I don't see him in the driveway.
- I think he bounced into Sid's yard!
- Oh! Buzz!
Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to
say something. What is it, boy?
- He's saying that this was no accident.
- What do you mean?
- I mean Humpty-Dumpty
was pushed... by Woody!
- No!
- What?
- Wait a minute.
You--You don't think I meant
to knock Buzz out the window,
do you? Potato Head?
- That's Mr. Potato Head to you,
you back-stabbing murderer!
Now, it was an accident, guys.
Come on.
Now, you, you
gotta believe me.
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?
Well, yea- N-
I don't like confrontations!
Where is your honor, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!
You don't deserve to- Hey!
You couldn't handle Buzz cutting
in on your playtime, could you, Woody?
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz
just might be Andy's new favorite toy.
So you got rid of him.
Well, what if Andy starts playing
with me more, Woody, huh?
You gonna knock me
outta the window too?
- I don't think we should
give him the chance.
- There he is, men.
- Frag him!
- Let's string him up
by his pull string!
- I got dibs on his hat!
- Would you boys stop it!
- Tackle him!
- No, no, no! W-W-Wait!
I can explain everything!
Okay, Mom, be right down.
I've gotta get Buzz.
Retreat!
Mom, do you know
where Buzz is?
- No, I haven't seen him.
- Psst!
Andy, I'm heading out the door!
- But, Mom, I can't find him!
- Honey, just grab some other toy.
Now, come on!
Oh, okay.
I couldn't find my Buzz,
know I left him right there.
Honey, I'm sure he's around
You'll find him.
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!
Buzz, the monkeys
aren't working!
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!
Oh, where could he be?
- Can I help pump the gas?
- Sure! I'll even let you drive.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, when you're 16.
- Yuk, yuk, yuk! Funny, Mom.
Aw, great. How am I gonna convince
those guys it was an accident?
Buzz!
Buzz! Ha! You're alive!
This is great!
Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved.
Andy'll find you here;
he'll take us back to the room;
and then you can tell everyone
that this was all just a big mistake.
Huh? Right?
Buddy?
I just want you to know that even
though you tried to terminate me,
revenge is not an idea
we promote on my planet.
- Oh. Well, that's good.
- But we're not on my planet, are we?
- No.
Okay, come on!
You want a piece of me?
- Owww!
- Buzz, Buzz,
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.
- Aah-ouch!
- Next stop.
- Pizza Planet! Yeah!
- Andy!
Wh-- Doesn't he realize
that I'm not there?
I'm lost!
Oh, I'm a lost toy!
Buzz Lightyear mission log.
The local sheriff and I seem to be at
a huge refueling station of some sort.
- You!
- According to my nava-computer, the-
- Shut up!
- Just shut up, you idiot!
- Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost. Andy is gone.
They're gonna move from their house
in two days, and it's all your fault!
My-- My fault? If you hadn't pushed me
out of the window in the first place--
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you...
hadn't shown up in your stupid
little cardboard spaceship
and taken away everything...
- that was important to me-
- Don't talk to me about importance!
Because of you the security
of this entire universe is in jeopardy!
What? What are
you talkin' about?
Right now, poised at
the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg...
has been secretly building
a weapon...
with the destructive capacity
to annihilate an entire planet!
I alone have information that reveals
this weapon's only weakness.
And you, my friend,
are responsible...
for delaying my rendezvous
with Star Command!
You... are... a... toy!
You aren't the real
Buzz Lightyear! You're a-
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!
You are a sad, strange little man;
and you have my pity.
- Farewell.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, ya loony!
- "Rendezvous with Star Command."
- I Driver] Hey, gas dude!
- You talkin' to me?
- Yeah, man. Can you help me?
- Pizza Planet? Andy!
- Do you know where
Cutting Boulevard is?
- Oh. no!
I can't show my face
in that room without Buzz.
- Buzz! Buzz, come back!
- Go away!
No! Buzz, you gotta
come back! I--
- I found a spaceship!
It's a spaceship, Buzz!
Come on, man, hurry up! Urn, like,
the pizzas are getting cold here!
Uh, Cutting Boulevard, huh?
- Yeah, yeah. Which way?
Now, you're sure this space freighter
will return to its port of origin...
- once it jettisons its food supply?
- Uh-huh.
And when we get there, we'll be able
to find a way to transport you home.
- Well, then, let's climb aboard.
- No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz!
- Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.
- Negative.
There are no restraining
harnesses in the cargo area.
- We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
- Yeah, bu-
- Buzz! Buzz!
That's two lefts and a right, huh?
- Thanks for the directions, okay?
- Yeah. And remember, kid-
- Buzz!
It's safer in the cockpit
than the cargo bay. What an idiot.
Next shuttle liftoff is scheduled for...
- T-minus 30 seconds and counting.
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.
The white zone is for immediate pizza-
- Sheriff!
There you are.
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.
- Great idea, Woody.
I like your thinkin'.
You are clear to enter.
- Welcome to Pizza Planet.
- Now!
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.
Jones, party
of five, your shuttle is now boarding-
Hey, Mom, can we have some tokens?
Ow! Watch
where you're going!
Sorry.
... nine, eight, seven, six,
- five, four, three,
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.
Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please?
- Andy!
- Now, we need to find a ship
that's headed for Sector 12.
Wait a minute.
No, no, no, Buzz! This way.
- There's a special ship.
I just saw it.
- You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hyperactive hyperdrive.
- And Astro, uh, turf!
- Where is it? I-I don't see the-
- Come on. That's it.
Spaceship!
All right, Buzz,
get ready. And-
- And the universe explodes!
- Okay, Buzz, when I say go,
we're gonna jump in the basket.
Buzz!
- No!
Hey, Mom, if I eat all my pizza,
- can I have some alien slime?
- This cannot be happening to me.
- A stranger.
- From the outside.
- Ooh!
- Greetings. I am Buzz Lightyear.
- I come in peace.
Before your
space journey, re-energize yourself...
with a slice of pepperoni,
now boarding at counter three.
This is an intergalactic emergency.
I need to commandeer
your vessel to Sector 12.
Who's in charge here?
The claw!
- The claw is our master.
- The claw chooses who
will go and who will stay.
- This is ludicrous.
- Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?
- Take that!
Oh, no! Sid!
- Get down!
- What's gotten into you? I wa-
- You are the one that decided
to climb into this--
Shh! The claw, it moves.
have been chosen!
Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.
Gotcha!
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!
- Yes!
Buzz! No!
- Hey!
- He has been chosen!
- He must go.
- Hey!
- What are you doing? Stop it!
Stop it, you zealots!
- Do not fight the claw.
All right!
Double prizes!
Let's go home and... play.
Sheriff, I can see
your dwelling from here.
- You're almost home.
- Nirvana is coming.
The mystic portal awaits.
Will you be quiet?
You guys don't get it, do you?
Once we go into Sid's house,
we won't be coming out.
- Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!
- Sit! Good boy.
- Hey, I got something for you, boy.
- Freeze!
- Ready, set, now!
Hannah!
Hey, Hannah!
- What?
- Did I get my package in the mail?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?
- I don't know!
- Oh, no, Hannah! Look, Janie!
- What? Hey!
- She's sick!
- No, she's not!
- I'll have to perform
one of my operations.
- No!
- No, not Sid's room. Not there.
- Hey, give it back!
Bid! Bid!
- Oh, no, we have
a sick patient here, Nurse.
- Prepare the O. R., stat!
Patient is... prepped.
No one's ever attempted
a double bypass...
brain transplant before.
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!
I don't believe that man's
ever been to medical school.
Doctor, you've done it!
Hannah!
- Janie's all better now.
Whatever she says,
it's not true!
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!
Locked.
- There's gotta be
another way outta here.
Uh, Buzz?
W-Was that you?
Hey, hi there,
little fella.
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?
J-B-B-B-Bu- Buzz!
B-B-B-B-Bu- Buzz!
- They're cannibals.
- Mayday, mayday.
- Come in, Star Command.
Send reinforcements.
Star Command, do you copy?
- I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Aw, great. Great. Yeah, and if anyone
attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.
- Hey, you guys,
I think I found him!
- Buzz, is that you?
Whiskers, will you
get outta here!
- You're interfering
with the search and rescue!
Look, they're home.
Mom, have you seen Woody?
- Where was the last place
you left him?
- Right here in the van.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone.
Woody's gone?
Yeah, boy,
the weasel ran away.
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.
Who would've thought he was capable
of such atrocities?
Oh, Slink,
hope he's okay.
Oh, a survivor.
Where's the rebel base? Talk!
I can see
your will is strong.
Well, we have ways
of making you talk.
Where are your rebel friends now?
Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!
All right!
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.
A lesser man would've talked
under such torture.
I sure hope
this isn't permanent.
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.
The door. It's open!
We're free!
- Woody, we don't know what's out there!
- I'll tell you wha-
- They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
Do something quick!
- Shield your eyes.
It's networking. I recharged it
before I left, l-lt should be good for--
You idiot! You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!
- Get away! Hoo-cha!
- Hey! Hey! How're you
doin' that? Stop that.
Back! Back,
you savages! Back!
- Woody, stop it!
- Sorry, guys, but dinner's canceled!
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home!
- There's no place like home.
Another stunt like that,
cowboy, you're gonna get us killed.
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Shh!
Yee-haw! Giddyap, pardner!
- We got to get this wagon
train a-movin'!
- Split up!
Hmm?
Calling Buzz Lightyear.
Come in, Buzz Lightyear.
- This is Star Command.
Buzz Lightyear, do you read me?
- Star Command!
Buzz Lightyear responding.
Read you loud and clear.
Buzz Lightyear,
planet Earth needs your help.
- On the way!
- Buzz Lightyear!
The world's greatest superhero!
Now the world's greatest toy!
Buzz has it all!
Locking wrist communicator!

# Out among the stars I sit #
# Way beyond the moon #
# In my silver ship I sailed #
# To a dream
that ended too soon #
# Now I know exactly #
-# Who I am and what I'm here for #
You are a toy! You can't fly!
# And I will go sailing #
# No more #
# But no, it can't be true #
# I could fly if I wanted to #
# Like a bird in the sky #
# If I believed I could fly #
# Why, I'd fly #
To infinity and beyond!
# - Clearly, I. #
# Will go sailing #
- Mom! Mom, have you seen
my Sally doll?
What, dear? What was that?
Never mind!
Oof! Oof!
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?
There's a secret
mission, in uncharted space. Let's go.
Really? That is so interesting.
Would you like some tea,
Mrs. Nesbitt?
- Buzz!
- It's so nice you could join us
on such late notice.
- Oh. no!
- What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbitt.
It goes quite well
with your head
Hannah! Oh, Hannah!
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.
I'll be right back.
What is it, Mom?
Mom, where are you?
Buzz. Hey.
Buzz, are you okay?
Gone!
It's all gone.
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye. Whoo-whoo. See ya.
- What happened to you?
- One minute you're defending
the whole galaxy.
And suddenly you find
yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with...
Marie Antoinette
and her little sister.
I think you've had
enough tea for today.
Let's get you
outta here, Buzz.
Don't you get it?
You see the hat?
- I am Mrs. Nesbitt! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Snap out of it, Buzz!
- I-l-I'm sorry. I-
You're right.
I am just a little depressed.
That's all.
--I can get through this.
- Oh, I'm a sham!
- Shh!
- Look at me.
- Quiet, Buzz.
I can't even
fly out of a window.
The hat look good?
Tell me the hat look good.
- The apron is a bit much.
-"Out the window"!
Buzz, you're a genius!
- Come on, come on. This way.
Years of academy,
training, wasted!
Ha, ha. B-3.
- Miss! G-6.
- Oh!
- You sunk it. Are you peeking?
- Heh, heh!
Oh, quit your whinin' and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.
- Give me the nose. Come on.
- How about three out of five?
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!
- Son of a building block. It's Woody.
- He's in the psycho's bedroom.
- Ha, ha! Hi!
- Everyone! It's Woody!
- Woody?
- You're kidding!
- Woody?
Ha! We're gonna
get outta here, Buzz.
Buzz?
- Hey, look!
- Woody!
Oh, boy, am I glad
to see you guys.
- I knew you'd come back, Woody.
- What are you doin' over there?
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.
Here! Catch this!
Ha!
- Whoa! I've got it, Woody.
- He got it, Woody.
Good goin', Slick. Now just,
just tie it on to somethin'.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got
a better idea. How 'bout we don't?
- Hey!
- Potato Head.
- Did you all take
stupid pills this morning?
Have you forgotten
what he did to Buzz?
And now you wanna let him
back over here?
No! No, no, no, no, no! You got it-
You got it all wrong, Potato Head.
Buzz is fine. Buzz is right here.
He's with me!
- You are a liar!
- No, I'm not. Buzz, come over here.
Tell the nice boys that you're-
that you're not dead.
Just a sec!
Buzz, will you get up here
and give me a hand?
That's very funny, Buzz.
- This is serious!
- Hey, Woody! Where'd ya go?
He's lying. Buzz ain't there.
Oh! Hi, Buzz!
Why don't you say hello
to the guys over there?
Hiya, fellas! To infinity and beyond!
Hey, look!
It's Buzz!
Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys
our new secret best friends handshake.
Give me five, man!
Something's screwy here.
So you see we're friends now, guys.
Aren't we, Buzz?
You bet. Give me a hug.
Ho-ho! Boy, I love you too.
See? It is Buzz.
- Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
- Wait just a minute.
- What are you tryin' to pull?
- Nothing!
- Oh, that is disgusting.
- Murderer!
- No! No, no, no, no, no!
- You murdering dog!
- It's not what you think. I swear!
- Save it for the jury.
I hope Sid pulls
your voice box out, ya creep.
No, no! No, no!
Don't leave! Don't leave!
Ya gotta help us, please! You don't
know what it's like over here!
Come on.
Let's get outta here.
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.
Come back! Slink!
Slink! Please!
Please! Listen to me!
No! No! Come back!
Slinky!
Buzz! Go away!
You disgusting freaks!
Aaah!
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals! Aah! Oof!
He is still alive, and you're
not gonna get him, you monsters!
What are you doin'?
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.
But-- But they're cannibals.
We saw them eat
those other toys.
Uh, sorry, l-l-l thought
that you were gonna--
You know, you know, eat my friend.
Hey, no, no, wait, hey!
- What's wrong?
- Sid?
Not now, Mom! I'm busy!
- Sid! Buzz, come on!
- You left that door open.
Get up! Use your legs! Fine!
Let Sid trash you, but don't blame me!
It came!
It finally came!
Ha, ha!
"The Big One."
"Extremely dangerous.
Keep out of reach of children."
Cool!
What am I gonna blow?
Man. Hey, where's
that wimpy cowboy doll?
Yes. I've always wanted
to put a spaceman into orbit.
- Heh, heh.
Now. Yes.
- Oh, no!
Oh, man!
Sid Phillips reporting.
Launch of the shuttle
has been delayed...
due to adverse weather
conditions at the launch site.
Tomorrow's forecast: sunny.
Sweet dreams.
I looked everywhere, honey,
but all I could find was your hat.
But what if we
leave them behind?
Oh, don't worry, honey.
I'm sure we'll find Woody
and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
I need air!
Why will you quit
movin' around?
I'm sorry. It's just that I get-
I get so nervous before I travel.
How did I get stuck
with you as a moving buddy?
Everyone else was picked.
Oh, Woody.
If only you could see
how much Andy misses you.
Psst. Psst! Hey, Buzz!
Hey.
Get over here and see if
you can get this toolbox off me.
Oh, come on, Buzz, I--
Buzz, I can't do this without you.
I need your help.
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me outta here.
Then I'll get that rocket off you,
and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?
Oh, Buzz. You've had a big fall.
You must not be thinking clearly.
No, Woody. For the first time
I am thinking clearly.
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.
I'm just a toy, a stupid,
little, insignificant toy.
Whoa, hey, wait a minute.
Bein' a toy is a lot better
than bein' a, a Space Ranger.
- Yeah, right.
- No, it is.
Look, over in that house is a kid
who thinks you are the greatest.
And it's not because
you're a Space Ranger, pal.
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.
But why would Andy want me?
Why would Andy want you? Look at you!
You're a Buzz Lightyear.
Any other toy would give up
his moving parts just to be you.
You've got wings.
You glow in the dark. You talk!
Your helmet does
that, that, that whoosh thing.
You are a cool toy.
As a matter of fact,
you're too cool.
mean, I mean, what chance
does a toy like me have...
against a Buzz Lightyear
action figure?
All I can do is--
There's a snake in my boots.
Why would Andy ever want
to play with me...
when he's got you?
I'm the one that should be
strapped to that rocket.
Listen, Buzz,
forget about me.
You should get outta here
while you can.
Buzz? What are you doin'?
I thought you were--
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid
over in that house who needs us.
Now let's get you out of this thing.
Yes, sir!
- Come on, Buzz. We can do it.
Woody, it's the moving van.
We gotta get outta here now.
Come on, Buzz.
All right.
Buzz!
- Hey, I'm out!
- Almost there.
I want to ride the pony.
Phew. Woody?
Woody? Are you all right?
I'm fine. I'm okay.
Oh, yeah!
Time for liftoff! Whoo!
To infinity and beyond!
- Aah! Back, back.
- Down, down!
- Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody. Think.
Guys!
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Wait. Listen, please.
There's a good toy down there, and he's
gonna be blown to bits in a few minutes.
All because of me.
We've gotta save him.
And, uh-
Bull need your help.
Please. He's my friend.
And he's the only one
I've got.
Thank you.
Okay, I think I know what to do.
We're gonna have
to break a few rules.
But if it works,
it'll help everybody.

Reach for the sky!
- Huh?
- This town ain't big enough
for the two of us.
- What?
- Somebody's poisoned the water hole.
- It's busted.
- Who are you callin' busted, buster?
- That's right.
- I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.
- We don't like bein' blown up,
Sid, or smashed or ripped apart.
-"We"?
That's right!
Your toys!
Mama!
Mama!
Mama! Mama!
Aaah!
Aaah!
- Mama!
From now on, you must take
good care of your toys!
Because if you don't,
we'll find out, Sid.
We toys can see
everything.
So play nice.
Aaah!
Ha-ha! We did it!
We did it! Ha-ha! Yes!
The toys!
The toys are alive!
N-Nice toy.
Aaah!
- What's wrong, Sid?
- Don't you want to play with Sally?
Nice work, fellows.
Good job.
Comin' out of the ground, what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.
Woody.
- Thanks.
Everybody say, "Bye, house!"
- Woody! The van!
- Bye, house.
- We gotta run! Thanks, guys!
- Quick!
Just go.
I'll catch up.
Aaah!
Come on!
- You can do it, Woody!
I got it! Woo-hoo-hoo!
- I made it.
Aaah! Get away,
you stupid dog! Down!
- Down! Aah! Aah!
- Hold on, Woody!
I can't do it.
- Take care of Andy for me!
- No!
- Buzz!
- Ow!
- Are we there already?
- Woody?
- How did you-
- How'd he get here?
- Where have you-
- What happened?
- Ow!
- What's goin' on?
- What's he takin'?
- Aha! There you are!
- Hey. What's he doing?
- Aah!
- He's at it again!
Ha, ha, ha!
- Get him!
- Come on!
- Ah, ah, no, no!
- No, no, no, no! Wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Pig pile!
Aaah!
- Get outta that car!
- Move it!
Whew.
No! Please!
You don't understand!
Buzz is out there.
We gotta help him.
- No!
- Toss him overboard!
No, no, no!
Wait! Aah!
- Hooray!
- So long, Woody!
Aah!
Oh! Woody!
- Oh! Well, thanks for the ride.
- Lookout!
Aaah!
- Now let's catch up to that truck.
Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C.
- What?
- And Buzz is with him!
- It is Buzz!
Woody was telling the truth.
- What have we done?
- Great! Now I have guilt.
We're almost there!
Rocky, the ramp!
Lookout!
Quick! Hold onto my tail!
- Attaboy, Slink!
- Oh! Woody!
Woody! Speed up!
- Speed up!
- The batteries!
They're runnin' out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa! Aah!
# Hakuna Matata
What a wonderful phrase
- Aaah!
- I can't hold on much longer.
- Slink! Hang on!
- Aaah!
- Ouch!
Great!
Woody! The rocket!
The match! Yes!
Thank you, Sid!
No! No, no! No!
No! Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no,
no!
No!
- Woody! What are you doing?
- Hold still, Buzz!
- Ha-ha! Ha-ha!
- You did it!
Next stop: Andy!
Wait a minute. I just lit a rocket.
Rockets explode!
I should have
held on longer.
Look! Look! It's Woody
and Buzz comin' up fast!
Woody!
Aah! Take cover!
Aaah! This is the part
where we blow up!
Not today!
Aaah!
Hey, Buzz!
You're flyin'!
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.
Ha-ha-ha!
To infinity and beyond!
Uh, Buzz,
we missed the truck.
We're not aiming
for the truck.
Hey, wow!
- What? What is it?
- Woody! Buzz!
- Oh, great, you found them.
Where were they?
- Here in the car!
See? Now, what'd I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.
- Which one can I open first?
- Let's let Molly open one.
Frankincense, this is Myrrh.
- Hey, heads up, everybody.
It's show time.
- Whoa! It's time!
Ohh! Oh, Bo.
There's got to be a less painful way
to get my attention.
Merry Christmas,
Sheriff.
- Say, isn't that mistletoe?
- Mm-hmm.
- Ooh!
- I Kissing Sounds, Bo Giggles]
Maybe Andy will get
another dinosaur.
Like a leaf eater. That way
I could play the, uh, dominant predator.
Quiet, everyone!
Quiet!
Molly's first
present is Mrs. Potato Head.
Repeat: a Mrs. Potato Head.
Way to go, Idaho!
Gee, I'd better shave.
- Come in, Frankincense.
Andy is now opening
his first present.
- It's-
- Buzz. Buzz Lightyear,
- I can't quite-
- you are not worried, are you?
- Me? No, no. Pfft.
- Make out-
No. No, no, no, no. Mm-mm.
A large box- It's- It's- It's-
- Are you?
- Now, Buzz,
what could Andy possibly get
that is worse than you?
Oh, what is it? What is it?
- Wow! A puppy!
# Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo #

Life's not fair, is it?
You see I -- well,
I... shall never be King.
And you...
shall never see the light of another day. ... Adieu...
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with your food?
What do you want?
I'm here to announce that King Mufasa is on his way.
So you'd better have a good excuse
for missing the ceremony this morning.
Oh now look, Zazu. You've made me lose my lunch.
Hah! You'll lose more than that when
the King gets through with you.
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.
Ohhh... I quiver with FEAR.
Now Scar, don't look at me that way...
HELP!!!!
Scar!
Mm-hmm...?
Drop him.
Impeccable timing, your majesty.
Eyyccch.
Why! If it isn't my big brother descending
from on high to mingle with the commoners.
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.
That was today? Oh, I feel simply awful.
...Must have slipped my mind.
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is,
as the king's brother,
you should have been first in line!
Well, I was first in line, ... until the little hairball was born.
"That ""hairball"" is my son -and your future king."
Ohh, I shall practice my curtsy.
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.
On, no, Mufasa. Perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.
Is that a challenge?
Temper, temper. I wouldn't dream of challenging you.
Pity! Why not?
Well, as far as brains go, I got the lion's share.
But, when it comes to brute strength ...
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool.
There's one in every family sire...
Two in mine actually. And they always manage to ruin special occasions.
What am I going to do with him?
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.
Zazu!
And just think! Whenever he gets dirty,
you could take him out and beat him.
Hmmm... Ah heh heh heh heh heh...
Simba
Hmmm... Ah heh heh heh heh heh.
Dad! Daad! Come on, Dad, we gotta go, wake up!
Oomph!
Sorry!
Dad? Daad. Dad, ...
Your son.... is awake....
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad...
Before sunrise, he's your son.
Dad? Daad! Come on, Dad! Daa- Whoa!
You promised!
Okay, okay. I'm up. I'm up.
Yeah!
Look Simba. Everything the light touches is our kingdom.
Wow.
A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun.
One day Simba, the sun will set on my time here
and will rise with you as the new king.
And this'll all be mine?
Everything.
Everything the light touches...What about that shadowy place?
"That's beyond our borders; you must never go there, Simba."
But I thought a king can do whatever he wants.
Oh, there's more to being king than-- getting your way all the time.
There's more?
Simba.
Everything you see exists together, in a delicate balance.
As king, you need to understand that balance,
and respect all the creatures
from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.
When we die,our bodies become the grass.
And the antelope eat the grass.
And so, we are all connected in the great Circle of Life.
Good morning, sire!
Good morning, Zazu.
Checking in... with the morning report.
Fire away.
Well! The buzz from the bees is that
the leopards are in a bit of a spot ...
Oh, really?
And the baboons are going ape over this.
What are you doing, son?
- What are you doing, son?
- Of course, the giraffes are acting like they're above it all....
- Pouncing.
- Let an old pro show you how it's done.
- The tick birds are pecking on the elephants.
I told the elephants to forget it, but they can't ...
Zazu, would you turn around?
Yes, sire.The Cheetahs are hard up, but as I always say ...
Stay low to the ground.
Cheetahs never prosper...
Okay, stay low to the ground, right yeah ...
What's going on?
A pouncing lesson.
Oh very good. Pouncing.
Pouncing!?!
Oh no, sire, you can't be serious ...
Oh, ... this is so humiliating.
Try not to make a sound.
What are you telling him Mufasa? Mufasa? ...Simba?
Ha ha ha ha ha. That's very good. Ha ha ha...
Zazu.
Yes?
Sir. News from the underground.
Now, this time--
Sire! Hyenas!! In the Pride Lands!
Zazu, take Simba home.
Oh Dad, can't I come?
No, son.
I never get to go anywhere.
"Oh young master, one day you will be king;"
then you can chase those slobbering, mangy,
stupid poachers from dawn until dusk.
Hey Uncle Scar, guess what!
I despise guessing games.
I'm going to be king of Pride Rock.
Oh goodee.
My Dad just showed me the whole kingdom,
and I'm going to rule it all. Heh heh.
Yes. Well... forgive me for not leaping for joy....
Bad back, you know.
Hey, Uncle Scar? When I'm king, what will that make you?
A monkey's uncle.
Heh heh. You're so weird.
You have no idea. ...
So, your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he?
Everything.
He didn't show you what's beyond
that rise at the northern border...?
Well, no... he said I can't go there.
And he's absolutely right!
It's far too dangerous. Only the bravest lions go there.
Well, I'm brave! What's out th--
"No, I'm sorry Simba; I just can't tell you."
Why not?
"Simba, Simba; I'm only looking out for
the well-being of my favorite nephew."
"Yeah, right; I'm your only nephew."
All the more reason for me to be protective...
An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince ... Oops!
An elephant what? Whoa!
Oh dear, I've said too much....
Well, I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later,
you being so clever and all....
Oh, just do me one favor--
Promise me you'll never visit that dreadful place.
No problem.
There's a good lad. You run along now and have fun.
And remember... it's our little secret.
Hey, Nala.
Hi, Simba.
Come on. I just heard about this great place.
Simba! I'm kind of in the middle of a bath.
And it's time for yours.
Mom! ... Mom. You're messing up my mane.
"Okay, okay; I'm clean. Can we go now?"
So where are we going? It better not be anyplace dumb.
No. It's really cool.
"So where is this ""really cool"" place?"
Oh.... uh ... around the water hole.
The water hole?! What's so great about the water hole?
I'll show you when we get there.
Oh.... Uh.... Mom, can I go with Simba?
Hmm... What do you think, Sarabi?
Well...
Pleeeease?
It's all right with me....
All right!
...As long as Zazu goes with you.
No! Not Zazu.
Step lively. The sooner we get to the water hole, the sooner we can leave.
So where're we really going?
An elephant graveyard.
Wow!
Shhh! Zazu.
Right. So how are we gonna ditch the dodo?
Oh I know how we can--
Oh, just look at you two.
Little seeds of romance blossoming in the savannah.
Your parents will be thrilled...
what with your being betrothed and all.
Be-what?
Betrothed. Intended. Affianced.
Meaning...?
One day you two are going to be married!
Yuck!
Ewww!
I can't marry her. She's my friend.
Yeah. It'd be too weird.
Well, sorry to bust your bubble, but you two turtle doves have no choice. It's a tradition...
...going back generations.
Well when I'm king, that'll be the first thing to go.
Not so long as I'm around.
Well in that case, you're fired.
Hmmm.... Nice try, but only the king can do that.
Well, He's the future king.
Yeah.So you have to do what I tell you.
Not yet I don't. And with an attitude like that,
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be a pretty pathetic king indeed.
Hmph. Not the way I see it.
I'm gonna be a mighty king. So enemies beware!
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts... With quite so little hair
I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my ROAR!!
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
You've rather a long way to go, young master, if you think....
No one saying do this
No one saying be there
No one saying stop that
No one saying see here
Free to run around all day
Free to do it all my way!
I think it's time that you and I. Arranged a heart to heart
Kings don't need advice
From little hornbills for a start
If this is where the monarchy is headed
Count me out!
Out of service, out of Africa I wouldn't hang about ... aaagh!
This child is getting wildly out of wing
Oh I just can't wait to be king!
Everybody look left
Everybody look right
Everywhere you look I'm
Standing in the spotlight
Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling
Oh I just can't wait to be king!
Oh I just can't wait to be king!
Oh I just can't waaaaaait ... to be kiiiiiiiiiing!
I beg your pardon, madam, but ... GET OFF!... Simba? Nala?
All right, it worked!
We lost 'im.
I ... am a genius.
Hey, Genius, it was my idea.
Yeah, but I pulled it off.
With me!
Oh yeah?... Rrarr!!
Ha. Pinned ya.
Hey, lemme up.
Pinned ya again.
This is it.... We made it.
Whoa!
It's really creepy.
Yeah... isn't it great?
We could get in big trouble.
I know, huh.
I wonder if its brains are still in there.
There's only one way to know. Come on. Let's go check it out.
The only checking out you will do will be to check out of here.
Aw, man.
We're way beyond the boundary of the Pride Lands.
Huh. Look, banana beak is scared. Heh.
That's Mister Banana Beak to you, fuzzy.
And right now we are all in very real danger.
Danger? Hah! I walk on the wild side.
I laugh in the face of danger. Ha ha ha ha!
Well, well, well, Banzai. What have we got here?
Hmm. I don't know Shenzi. Uh... What do you think, Ed?
Yeah, just what I was thinking. A trio of trespassers!!
And quite by accident, let me assure you.
A simple navigational error. Eh heh heh...
Whoa, whoa, wait wait wait.... I know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.
I, madam, am the king's majordomo.
And that would make you...?
The future king.
Do you know what we do to kings who step out of their kingdom?
Puh. You can't do anything to me.
Uhh.... Technically, they can. We are on their land.
But Zazu, you told me they're nothing
but slobbering mangy stupid poachers.
Ix-nay on the oopid-stay...
"Who you callin' ""oopid-stay?!?"""
My, my, my. Look at the sun. It's time to go!
What's the hurry? We'd love you to stick around for dinner.
Yeaaaah! We could have whatever's ... lion around!
Get it? Lion around!
Oh wait, wait, wait. I got one, I got one.
Make mine a cub sandwich. Whatcha think?
What? Ed? What is it?
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?
No. Why?
'Cause there it goes!!
Did we lose 'em?
I think so.... Where's Zazu?
The little Majordomo bird hippity-hopped
all the way to the birdie-boiler.
Oh no.... Not the birdie boiler! Aaaaaaaa...!
Hey! Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
Like ... you?
Oops!
Boo!
Simba!
Aaaaiee!
Here kitty, kitty, kitty.
Oo-hoo... That was it? Hah. Do it again.... come on.
Huh?!
Oh, Please, please. Uncle. Uncle.
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Silence!
Oh, we're gonna shut up right now.
Calm down. We're really sorry.
If you ever come near my son again...
Oh this is ... this is your son?!?
Oh your son??
Did you know that?
No.... Me? I-I-I didn't know it. No. Did you?
No! Of course not.
No! Ed?
Toodles!
Dad, I ..
You deliberately disobeyed me.
Dad, I'm.... I'm sorry.
Let's go home.
I thought you were very brave.
Zazu?
Yes, sire?
Take Nala home. I've got to teach my son a lesson.
Come, Nala. Simba... Good luck.
Simba!
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.
I know.
You could have been killed. You deliberately disobeyed me.
And what's worse,- you put Nala in danger!
I was just trying to be brave like you.
I'm only brave when I have to be.
Simba ... being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.
But you're not scared of anything.
I was today.
You were?
Yes ... I thought I might lose you.
Oh. I guess even kings get scared, huh?
Mm-hmm.
But you know what?
What?
I think those hyenas were even scareder.
Cause nobody messes with your dad. Come here, you.
Oh no, no ... Aaagh! Errrggh! ...
Oh, come here... Hah! Gotcha!
Dad?
Hmm?
We're pals, right?
Right.
And we'll always be together, right?
Simba, ... Let me tell you something that my father told me ... Look at the stars.
The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars.
Really?
Yes ... So whenever you feel alone,
just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you
... And so will I.
Man that lousy Mufasa! I won't be able to sit for a week.
It's not funny, Ed.
Hey, shut up!
Will you knock it off!
Well, he started it.
Look at you guys. No wonder we're dangling at the bottom of the food chain.
Man, I hate dangling.
Shyeah? You know, if it weren't for those lions, we'd be runnin' the joint.
Yeah. Man, I hate lions.
So pushy. And hairy. And stinky.
And man are they ...
Uuug-LEE!
Oh, surely we lions are not all that bad.
Ohh. Oh Scar, it's just you.
We were afraid it was somebody important.
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.
Yeah.
I see.
Now that's power.
Tell me about it. I just hear that name and I shudder.
Mufasa.
Ooooh. ... Do it again.
Mufasa.
Ooooh.
Mufasa. Mufasa! Mufasa!
Oooh! It tingles me.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Not you Scar, I mean, you're one of us. I mean, you're our pal.
Charmed.
Ohh, I like that. He's not king, but he's still so proper.
Yeah. Hey, hey hey. Did ya bring us anything to eat,
Scar, old buddy, old pal? Huh? Did-ya-did-ya-did-ya?
I don't think you really deserve this.
I practically gift wrapped those cubs for you.
And you couldn't even dispose of them.
Well, ya know
it wasn't exactly like they was alone, Scar.
Yeah. What are we supposed to do?... Kill Mufasa?
Precisely.
I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are, pay attention
My words are a matter of pride
It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares
So prepare for the chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer
And where do we feature?
Just listen to teacher
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues!
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!
Yeah, be prepared. Yeah-heh. We'll be prepared, heh ... For what?
For the death of the king.
Why? Is he sick?
No fool, we're going to kill him. And Simba too.
Great idea! Who needs a king?
No king! No king! la--la-la--la-laa-laa!
IDIOTS! There will be a king!
Hey, but you said, uh...
I WILL BE KING! Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again!
Yaay! All right! Long live the king!
Long live the king! Long live the king!
It's great that we'll soon be connected.
With a king who'll be all-time adored.
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!
So prepare for the coup of the century
Be prepared for the murkiest scam
Meticulous planning
Tenacity spanning
Decades of denial
Is simply why I'll be king undisputed
Respected, saluted
And seen for the wonder I am
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!
Now you wait here. Your father has a marvelous surprise for you.
Ooooh. What is it?
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise, now would it?
If you tell me, I'll still act surprised.
Ho ho ho
You are such a naughty boy!
Come on, Uncle Scar.
This is just for you and your daddy
You know, a sort of father-son ... thing....
Well! I'd better go get him.
I'll go with you.
No! Heh heh heh. No. Just ... stay on this rock.
You wouldn't want to end up in another mess
like you did with the hyenas...
You know about that?
Simba, everybody knows about that.
Really?
Oh, yes. Lucky Daddy was there to save you, eh?
Oh, and just between us, you might
want to work on that little roar of yours, hmm?
Oh, okay ...
Hey, Uncle Scar? ...Will I like the surprise?
Simba, it's to DIE for.
Shut up.
I can't help it. I'm so hungry ...
I gotta have a wildebeest!
Stay put.
Well can't I just pick off one of the little sick ones?
No! We wait for the signal from Scar.
There he is
Let's go.
Little roar. Puh!
Rarrr!
Rrrraowr-nh.
RAOWR!!
"Oh look, sire; The herd is on the move.
Odd...."
Mufasa. Quick. Stampede. In the gorge. Simba's down there!
Simba?
Zazu!
Help me!
Your father is on the way! Hold on!
Hurry!
There! There! On that tree!
Hold on, Simba!!
Ahhhh!!!
Oh, Scar, this is awful! What'll we do what'll we do?!
Hah ... I'll go back for help, that's what
I'll do, I'll go back for he-- oomph!
Scar! ... Broth-- Brother ... Help me!
Long live the king!
Aaaaaaahh!
NOOOOOOOO!
Daaad!!
Dad?
Dad? ...Dad, come on. You gotta get up.
Dad.We gotta go home.
HEEEEELP!
Somebody! Anybody... help.
Simba. ... What have you done?
There were wilde beest and he tried to save me
It was an accident, I didn't mean for it to happen.
Of course, of course, you didn't.
No one ever means for these things to happen.... But the king is dead.
And if it weren't for you, he'd still be alive.
Oh! What will your mother think?
What am I gonna do?
Run away, Simba.... Run.... Run away, and never return.
Kill him.
Whoa!!
Yeooow!
Hey-- There he goes! There he goes!
So go get 'im.
There ain't no way I'm going in there. What you want me
to come out looking like you? Cactus Butt?
But we gotta finish the job.
Well, he's as good as dead out there anyway.
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.
Yeah! you hear that? If you ever come back, we'll kill ya!
"Mufasa's death was a terrible tragedy; but to lose Simba ..."
who had barely begun to live....
For me, it is a deep personal loss.
And so it is with a heavy heart that I assume the throne.
Yet, out of the ashes of this tragedy,
we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era
in which lion and hyena come together,
in a great and glorious future.
Heeyyyaaaahh!! Get out! Get out! Get outta here!!!! Whoo!
I love it! Bowling for buzzards!
Gets 'em every time.
Uh-oh. Hey Timon. You better come look.
I think it's still alive.
Yeewgh!...
All righty, what have we got here?
Jeez, it's a lion! Run Pumbaa! Move it!
Hey, Timon. It's just a little lion. Look at him.
He's so cute, and all alone! Can we keep him?
Pumbaa, are you nuts?! We're talking about a lion.
Lions eat guys like us.
But he's so little.
He's gonna get bigger.
Maybe he'll be on our side.
A--Huh! That's the stupidest thing I ever heard. Maybe he'll b--
Hey, I got it! What if he's on our side?
You know, having a lion around might not be such a bad idea.
So we keeping 'im?
Pthpt. Of course. Who's the brains in this outfit?
Uhhh....
My point exactly. Jeez, I'm fried.
Let's get out of here and find some shade.
You okay, kid?
I guess so.
You nearly died.
I saved you.
Well, uh, Pumbaa helped...a little.
Thanks for your help.
Hey, where you going?
Nowhere.
Gee. He looks blue.
I'd say brownish-gold.
No, no, no, no. I mean he's depressed.
Kid, what's eatin' ya?
Nothing-- he's at the top of the food chain!
The food cha-haain! Ah heh-- Ahem.
So, where you from?
Who cares? I can't go back.
"Ahh. You're an outcast! That's great; so are we!"
What'cha do, kid?
Something terrible. But I don't wanna talk about it.
Good. We don't wanna hear about it.
Come on Timon. Anything we can do?
Not unless you can change the past.
"You know, kid, in times like this my buddy Timon here says
""You got to put your behind in your past."""
No. No. No.
I mean...
"Amateur. Lie down before you hurt yourself.
It's ""You got to put your past behind you."""
Look, kid. Bad things happen, and you can't do anything about it, right?
Right.
Wrong! When the world turns its back on you,
you turn your back on the world!
Well, that's not what I was taught.
Then maybe you need a new lesson.
Repeat after me. Hakuna Matata.
What?
Ha-ku-na Ma-ta-ta. It means no worries.
Hakuna Matata!
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata!
Ain't no passing craze
It means no worries for the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata!
Hakuna Matata?
Yeah, it's our motto.
What's a motto?
Nothing! What's a motto with you? Ah haah haah hah hah...
You know, kid-- these two words will solve all your problems.
That's right! Take Pumbaa for example.
Why, when he was a young wart-hog
When I was a young wart hooog!
Very nice.
Thanks!
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the Savannah after every meal
I'm a sensitive soul though I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
And oh, the shame
He was ashamed
Thoughta changin' my name
Oh, what's in a name
And I got downhearted
How did you feel
Ev'rytime that I...
Hey, Pumbaa! Not in front of the kids!
Oh. Sorry.
Hakuna Matata!
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata!
Ain't no passing craze
It means no worries
For the rest of your days
Yeah, sing it, kid!
It's our problem-free philosophy.
Hakuna Matata!
Welcome to our humble home.
You live here?
We live wherever we want.
Yep. Home is where your rump rests. Heh!
It's beautiful.
I'm starved!
I'm so hungry I could eat a whole zebra.
Eeeahhah. We're fresh out of zebra.
- Any antelope?
- Na ah.
- Hippo?
- No
Listen kid, if want to live with us, you have to eat like us
Hey, this looks like a good spot to rustle up some grub
- What's that?
A grub, what's it look like?
Ooh, Gross!
It tastes like chicken
Slimy yet satisfying!
These are rare delicacies. Hmm. Piquant with a very pleasant
crunch.
You'll learn to love them!
I'm telling you kid, this is the great life.
No rules, no responsibility.
ooh, the little cream filled kind... and best of all, no worries! Well kid!
Oh, well...
Hakuna Matata!
Slimy, yet satisfying.
That's it!
Hakuna Matata
It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata!
Nobody knows
The trouble I see...
Nobody knows
My sorrow...
Oh Zazu, do lighten up.
Sing something with a little bounce in it.
It's a small world after all
No! No. Anything but that!
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts
There they are a-standing in a row.
Big ones, small ones, some as big as your head
Oh I would never have had to do this for Mufasa.
What? What did you say?
Oh, nothing!
You know the law: Never, ever mention that name in my presence.
I ... am ... the king!
Yes, sire. You are the king. I, I, Well,
Well I only mentioned it to illustrate the differences
in your royal managerial approaches.
Hey, Boss!
Oh, What is it this time?
We got a bone to pick with you.
I'll handle this. Scar, there's no food, no water.
Yeah, it's dinner time, and we ain't got no stinkin' entrees.
It's the lionesses' job to do the hunting
Yeah, but they won't go hunt.
Oh, eat Zazu.
Oh, you wouldn't want me. I'd be so tough and gamey and- eewwgh!
Oh, Zazu, don't be ridiculous!
All you need is a little garnish.
I thought things were bad under Mufasa...
What did you say?
I said Muf--
"I said, uh ... ""Qu pasa?"""
Good. Now get out.
Mm, yeah, but-- we're still hungry.
Out!
Whoah. Nice one, Simba.
Thanks. Man, I'm stuffed.
Me too. I ate like a pig!
Pumbaa-- you are a pig.
Oh. Right.
Timon?
Yeah?
Ever wonder what those sparkly dots are up there?
"Pumbaa. I don't wonder; I know."
Oh! ...What are they?
They're fireflies. Fireflies that uh, got stuck up
on that big, bluish-black, thing.
Oh. Gee. I always thought that they were
balls of gas burning billions of miles away.
Pumbaa, wit' you, everything's gas.
Simba, what do you think?
Well, I don't know
Aw come on. Give, give, give ..
Well, come on, Simba, we told you ours... pleeeease?
Well, somebody once told me that the great kings
of the past are up there watching over us.
Really?
You mean a bunch of royal dead guys are watching us?Pbbb.
Who told you something like that? What mook made that up?
Yeah. Pretty dumb, huh?
Ah, you're killing me, Simba.
Was it something I said?
Simba? He's- he's alive? He he- He's alive!!
It is time!
Ohi'mbube
Ohi'mbube
In the jungle
The mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight.
In the jungle
The mighty jungle
The lion sleeps to--
I can't hear ya, buddy, back me up!
A-weee-ee-ee-ee aa-Pum-ba-bum-ba-waaay...
A-Pumbaa? Pumbaa?
Timon?
HYEEEEAAAHHH!!!!!
Pumbaa?
Pumbaa? What's going on?
SHE'S GONNA EAT ME!!
Huh?
Whoah!! ... Jeez! Why do I always have to save your AAAAAA!!
"Don't worry, buddy; I'm here for you. Everything's gonna be okay."
Get her! Bite her head! Go for the jugular. The jugular!
See, I told you he'd come in handy.
Nala?
Is it really you?
Who are you?
It's me. Simba.
Simba? Whoah!!!
Well how did you.. where did you come from ... it's great to see you..
Aaaah! how did you... who... wow... this is cool... it's great to see you.
Hey, what's goin' on here?
What are you doing here?
"What do you mean,
""What am I doing here?"" What are you doing here?"
HEY!! WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?!?
"Timon, this is Nala; she's my best friend!"
Friend?!?
Yeah. Hey, Pumbaa! Come over here.
Nala, this is Pumbaa. Pumbaa, Nala.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
The pleasure's all mine.
How do you do.. Whoa! Whoa. Time out... Let me get this straight.
You know her. She knows you. But she wants to eat him.
And, everybody's okay with this?
DID I MISS SOMETHING?!
Relax, Timon.
Wait 'til everybody finds out you've been here all this time.
And your mother what will she think?
She doesn't have to know. Nobody has to know.
Well, of course they do. Everyone thinks you're dead.
They do?
Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.
He did? What else did he tell you?
What else matters? You're alive. And that means... you're the king!
King? Pbbb. Lady, have you got your lions crossed.
King? Your Majesty! I gravel at your feet.
Stop it.
"It's not ""gravel,"" it's ""grovel."" And don't; he's not the king. Are ya?"
No.
Simba!
No, I'm not the king. Maybe I was gonna be.
But, that was a long time ago.
Let me get this straight. You're the king?
And you never told us?
Look, I'm still the same guy.
But with power!
Could you guys ... excuse us for a few minutes?
Hey, whatever she has to say, she can say in front of us. Right, Simba?
Hmm.... Maybe you'd better go .
It starts. You think you know a guy.....
Timon and Pumbaa. You learn to love 'em.
What? What is it?
It's like you're back from the dead.
You don't know how much this will mean to everyone.
What it means to me.
" Hey; it's OK."
I've really missed you.
I've missed you too.
I tell ya, Pumbaa. This stinks.
Oh. Sorry.
Not you. Them! Him. Her. Alone...
What's wrong with that?
I can see what's happening
What?
And they don't have a clue
Who?
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two.Oh...
Ze sweet caress of twilight
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible!
She'd turn away from me
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside?
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are.
And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed
His carefree days with us are history
In short, our pal is doomed
Isn't this a great place?
It is beautiful.... But I don't understand something.
You've been alive all this time.
Why didn't you come back to Pride Rock?
Well, I just ... needed to get out on my own.
Live my own life. And I did. And it's great!
We've really needed you at home.
No one needs me.
Yes we do! You're the king.
Nala, we've been through this. I'm not the king. Scar is.
Simba, he let the hyenas take over the Pride Lands.
What?
Everything's destroyed. There's no food, no water.
Simba, if you don't do something soon, everyone will starve.
I can't go back.
Why?
You wouldn't understand.
What wouldn't I understand?
No, no, no. It doesn't matter. Hakuna Matata.
What?
Hakuna Matata. It's something I learned out here.
Look, sometimes bad things happen
Simba!
...and there's nothing you can do about it! So why worry?
Because it's your responsibility.
Well, what about you? you left.
I left to find help! And I found you.
Don't you understand? You're our only hope.
Sorry.
What's happened to you? You're not the Simba I remember.
"You're right; I'm not. Now are you satisfied?"
No, just disappointed.
You know, you're starting to sound like my father.
Good. At least one of us does.
Listen! You think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life?
You don't even know what I've been through.
I would if you'd just tell me!
Forget it! Fine!
She's wrong. I can't go back. What would it prove, anyway?
It won't change anything. You can't change the past.
You said you'd always be there for me!... But you're not.
And it's because of me. It's my fault.... It's my ... fault.
Come on, will you cut it out?
Can't cut it out. It'll grow right back!
Creepy little monkey. Will you stop following me? Who are you?
The question is: whooo... are you?
I thought I knew.... Now I'm not so sure.
Well, I know who you are. Shh. Come here. It's a secret.
Ernh! Enough already! ...What's that supposed to mean anyway?
It means you are a baboon-- and I'm not.
I think, you're a little confused.
"Wrong! I'm not the one who's confused;
you don't even know who you are!"
Oh, and I suppose you know.
"Sure do; You're Mufasa's boy!"
Bye!
Hey, wait!
You knew my father?
Correction-- I know your father.
I hate to tell you this, but he died. A long time ago.
Nope. Wrong again! Hah hah hah! He's alive and I'll show him to you.
"You follow old Rafiki; he knows the way. Come on!"
Don't dawdle.... Hurry up!
Hey, whoa. Wait, wait.
Come on. Come on!
Would you slow down?
STOP! Shhh. Look down there.
That's not my father. That's just my reflection.
Noo. Look ... harder.
You see ... he lives in you.
Simba . . .
Father?
Simba, you have forgotten me.
No. How could I?
You have forgotten who you are, and so have forgotten me.
Look inside yourself, Simba.
You are more than what you have become.
You must take your place in the Circle of Life.
How can I go back? I'm not who I used to be.
Remember who you are. You are my son, and the one true king.
Remember who you are.
No! Please! Don't leave me.
Remember...
Father!
Remember...
Don't leave me.
Remember...
What was that? The weather-- Pbbbah! Very peculiar. Don't you think?
Yeah. Looks like the winds are changing.
Ahhh, change is good.
Yeah, but it's not easy. I know what I have to do.
But, going back means I'll have to face my past.
I've been running from it for so long....Oww! Jeez-- what was that for?
"It doesn't matter; it's in the past!"
Yeah, but it still hurts.
Oh yes, the past can hurt. But the way I see it,
you can either run from it... or ... learn from it.
Hah! You see? So what are you going to do?
First... I'm going to take your stick.
No, no, no, no! Not the stick!
Hey! Where are you going?
I'm going back!
Good! Go on! Get out of here!
Hey. Hey, wake up.
It's OK. Whoa, whoa. It's OK. It's me.
Don't ever do that again! Carnivores, oy!
Have you guys seen Simba?
I thought he was with you.
He was, but now I can't find him. Where is he?
Ho ho ho ho! You won't find him here.
Ha ha. The king has returned.
I can't believe it. He's gone back!
Gone back? What do you mean? Hey!
What's going on here? Who's the monkey?!
Simba's gone to challenge Scar.
Who?
Scar.
Who's got a scar?
No, no, no. It's his uncle.
The monkey's his uncle?
No! Simba's gone back to challenge his uncle
to take his place as king.
Ohhh.
Simba, wait up! It's awful, isn't it?
I didn't want to believe you.
What made you come back?
I finally got some sense knocked into me.
And I've got the bump to prove it.
Besides, this is my kingdom. If I don't fight for it, who will?
I will.
It's going to be dangerous.
Danger? I laugh in the face of danger. Hah ha ha haa!
I see nothing funny about this.
Timon? Pumbaa? What are you doing here?
At your service, my liege.
Uh.. We're going to fight your uncle ... for this?
"Yes, Timon; this is my home."
Phh. Talk about your fixer-upper. Well, Simba,
if it's important to you we're with you to the end.
Live bait.
Good idea. Hey.
Come on, Timon-- you guys have to crate a diversion.
What do you want me to do? Dress in drag and do the hula?
If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat
Eat my buddy Pumbaa here because he is a treat
Come on down and dine
On this tasty swine
All you have to do is get in line
Aaaare ya achin'
Yup, yup, yup
Fooor some bacon?
Yup, yup, yup
Heee's a big pig
Yup, yup, yup
You could be a big pig too.
Yup, yup
Nala, you find my mother and rally the lionesses.
I'll look for Scar.
SARABIII!
Yes, Scar?
Where is your hunting party?
They're not doing their job.
Scar, there is no food. The herds have moved on.
No. You're just not looking hard enough.
It's over. There is nothing left.
We have only one choice. We must leave Pride Rock.
We're not going anywhere.
Then you have sentenced us to death!
Then so be it.
You can't do that.
I'm the king. I can do... whatever I want.
If you were half the king Mufasa was you would neve--
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!
Mufasa? No-- you're dead.
Mufasa?
"No; it's me."
Simba? You're alive? How can that be?
"It doesn't matter; I'm home."
Simba? Simba! I'm a little surprised to see you... alive.
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart.
Oh, Simba, you must understand. The pressures of ruling a kingdom...
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.
Oh, oh, ye-- Well, I would, heh, naturally,
heh-- however, there is one little problem.
You see them? They think I'm king.
Well, we don't. Simba is the rightful king.
The choice is yours, Scar. Either step down or fight.
Oh, must it all end in violence?
I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member.
Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
That's not gonna work, Scar. I've put it behind me.
Eh, but what about your faithful subjects?
Have they put it behind them?
Simba, what is he talking about?
Ahh, so you haven't told them your little secret.
Well, Simba, now's your chance to tell them.
Tell them who is responsible for Mufasa's death!
I am.
It's not true. Tell me it's not true.
It's true.
You see, he admits it! Murderer!
No! It was an accident!
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would still be alive.
It's your fault he's dead.... Do you deny it?
No.
Then ... you're ... guilty!
No. I'm not a murderer.
Oh Simba, you're in trouble again.
But this time, Daddy isn't here to save you.
And now everyone knows why!
Simba!
Now this looks familiar. Hmm. Where have I seen this before.
Let me think. Hmmm... hmmm. Oh yes, I remember.
This is just the way your father looked before he died.
And here's my little secret. I killed Mufasa.
NoooooOOO.... MURDERER!
No, Simba please.
Tell them the truth.
Truth? But, truth is in the eye of the beholdllgkkk!
All right. All right. I did it.
So they can hear you.
I ... killed ... Mufasa!
Heyyy-yaaaaah!!
'Scuse me. Pardon me. Comin' through. Hot stuff. Whoo!
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me in let me in! Pleeease don't eat me.
Problem?
Hey, who's the pig?
Are you talking to me?
- Uh oh. They called him a pig.
Are you talking to me?! - Shouldn't 'a done that.
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?!?
Now they're in for it.
THEY CALL ME.. MISTER PIIIG! AAAAAAAAAAA--
Take that! And that!
Take that! And that! You yellow belly...
Murderer.
Simba, Simba. Please. Please have mercy. I beg you.
You don't deserve to live.
But, Simba, I am ... ah ... family.
It's the hyenas who are the real enemy.
It was their fault-- it was their idea!
Why should I believe you? Everything you ever told me was a lie.
What are you going to do? You wouldn't kill your old Uncle...?
No, Scar. I'm not like you.
Oh, Simba, thank you. You are truly noble.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
How can I, ah, prove myself to you?
Tell me, I mean, anything.
Run. Run away, Scar. And never return.
Yes. Of course.... As you wish, your Majesty!
Ahh, my friends.
Frie-he-hends? I thought he said we were the enemy!
Yeah, that's what I heard.
Ed?
No. L-L-L-Le-Le-Le-Le-Let me explain.
No. You don't understand.
No! I didn't mean for... No, No!
Look, I'm sorry I called you... No! NOO!
It is time.
Remember . . .
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the Circle
The Circle of Life
The Circle of Life
Oh l Come from a land,
From a faraWay plaCe
Where the Caravan Camels roam
Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense
lt's barbariC but hey, it's home
When the Wind's from the east
And the sun's from the West
And the sand in the glass is right
Come on doWn, stop on by,
Hop a Carpet and fly
To another Arabian night
Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
More often than not
Are hotter than hot
ln a lot of good Ways
Arabian nights
'Neath Arabian moons
A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard
Out there on the dunes
Salaam and good evening to you,
worthy friend.
Please come closer.
Too close. A little too close.
There.
Welcome to Agrabah.
City of mystery.
Of enchantment.
And the finest merchandise this side
of the river Jordan. Come on down.
Look at this. Combination hookah
and coffee maker.
Also makes julienne fries.
Will not break.
lt broke.
Look at this. l have never seen
one of these intact before.
This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen.
Still good.
Wait, don't go!
l can see you're only interested
in the exceptionally rare.
l think, then, you would be
most rewarded to consider this.
Do not be fooled
by its commonplace appearance.
Like so many things,
it is not what is outside,
but what is inside that counts.
This is no ordinary lamp.
lt once changed the course
of a young man's life.
A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than what he seemed.
A diamond in the rough.
Perhaps you would like
to hear the tale?
lt begins on a dark night.
Where a dark man waits
with a dark purpose.
You are late.
A thousand apologies, oh patient one.
- You have it, then?
- l had to slit a few throats.
But l got it.
The treasure.
Trust me, my pungent friend.
You'll get what's coming to you.
What's coming to you.
Quickly, follow the trail.
Faster.
At last, after all
my years of searching.
The cave of wonders.
Cave of wonders.
By Allah.
Now, remember.
Bring me the lamp.
The rest of the treasure is yours,
but the lamp is mine.
The lamp. The lamp.
Jeez, where'd you dig this bozo up?
Who disturbs my slumber?
lt is l. Gazeem.
A humble thief.
Know this. Only one may enter here.
One whose worth lies far within.
The diamond in the rough.
What are you waiting for? Go on.
No!
Seek thee out
the diamond in the rough.
l can't believe it.
l just don't believe it.
We're never going to get ahold
of that stupid lamp.
Just forget it.
Look at this.
l'm so ticked off that l'm molting.
Patience, lago. Patience.
Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.
There's a big surprise.
l think l'm gonna have a heart attack
and die from that surprise.
What are we going to do?
We got a big problem here, a big...
Yes.
Only one may enter.
l must find this one,
this diamond in the rough.
Stop, thief!
l'll have your hands
for a trophy, street rat.
All this for a loaf of bread?
- There he is.
- You won't get away so easy.
You think that was easy?
You two, over that way.
And you, follow me. We'll find him.
- Morning, ladies.
- Getting into trouble early today,
aren't we, Aladdin?
Trouble? No way.
You're only in trouble
if you get caught.
- Gotcha.
- l'm in trouble.
And this time...
Perfect timing, Abu.
As usual.
Let's get outta here.
Got to keep one jump
Ahead of the bread line
One sWing ahead of the sWord

One hit ahead of the floCk
l think l'll take a stroll
Around the bloCk
- Stop, thief.
- Vandal.
- Abu.
- Scandal.
Let's not be too hasty
Still l think he's rather tasty
Got to eat to live, got to steal to eat,
Otherwise We'd get along
Wrong
Get him!
He's got a sword.
You idiots.
We've all got swords.
One jump ahead of the hoof beats
One hop ahead of the hump
One triCk ahead of disaster,
They're quiCk but l'm muCh faster
Here goes, better throW my hand in,
Wish me happy landing
All l got to do is jump!
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast.
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast.
Here.
Go on, take it.
Ah, don't.
On his way to the palace, l suppose.
Another suitor for the princess.
Out of my way, you filthy brats.
Hey! lf l were as rich as you,
l could afford some manners.
l'll teach you some manners.
Look at that, Abu.
lt's not every day you see
a horse with two rear ends.
You are a worthless street rat.
You were born a street rat,
you'll die a street rat
and only your fleas will mourn you.
l'm not worthless.
And l don't have fleas.
Come on, Abu. Let's go home.
Riffraff, street rat
l don't buy that
lf only they'd look Closer
Would they see a poor boy?
No siree
They'd find out
There's so muCh more to me
Some day, Abu,
things are going to change.
We'll be rich, live in a palace
and never have any problems at all.
- l've never been so insulted.
- Prince Achmed.
You're not leaving so soon, are you?
Good luck marrying her off.
Jasmine.
Confound it, Rajah.
So this is why
Prince Achmed stormed out.
Oh, Father. Rajah was just playing
with him. Weren't you, Rajah?
You were just playing
with that overdressed,
self-absorbed Prince Achmed,
weren't you?
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes to call.
The law says you must be married
to a prince by your next birthday.
- The law is wrong.
- You've only got three more days.
Father, l hate being forced into this.
lf l do marry,
l want it to be for love.
Jasmine, it's not only this law.
l'm not going
to be around forever, and...
l just want to make sure
you're taken care of.
- Provided for.
- Please try to understand.
l've never done a thing on my own.
l've never had any real friends.
Except you, Rajah.
l've never even been
outside the palace walls.
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.
Then maybe l don't want to be
a princess anymore.
Allah forbid you should
have any daughters.
l don't know where she gets it from.
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.
Jafar, my most trusted advisor.
l am in desperate need of your wisdom.
My life is but to serve you, my lord.
lt's this suitor business.
Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.
l'm at my wits' end.
Wits' end.
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.
Your Majesty certainly
has a way with dumb animals.
Now, then.
Perhaps l can divine a solution
to this thorny problem.
lf anyone can help, it's you.
But it would require
the use of the mystic blue diamond.
My ring?
- But it's been in the family for years.
- lt is necessary to find a suitor.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be... fine.
The diamond.
Here, Jafar.
Whatever you need will be fine.
You are most gracious, my liege.
Now run along
and play with your little toys.
That will be pretty good.
l can't take it anymore.
lf l gotta choke down on one more
of those moldy, disgusting crackers...
Calm yourself, lago.
Soon l will be sultan,
not that addle-pated twit.
And then l stuff the crackers
down his throat.
l'm sorry, Rajah.
But l can't stay here
and have my life lived for me.
l'll miss you.
Goodbye.
Oranges from Jaffa.
Ok, Abu. Go.
Try this. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.
Get your paws off that.
Why, you... Get away from here,
you cursed, filthy ape.
Bye-bye.
Nice going Abu.
Breakfast is served.
Pretty lady, buy a pot.
No finer pot in brass or silver.
Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs.
Sugar dates and pistachios.
Would the lady like a necklace?
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.
Fresh fish. We catch 'em, you buy them.
No. l don't think so.
Excuse me.
l'm really very sorry.
Hello?
You must be hungry.
- Here you go.
- You'd better be able to pay for that.
- Pay?
- No one steals from my cart.
l'm sorry, sir.
l don't have any money.
- Thief!
- Please.
lf you let me go to the palace,
l can get some from the sultan.
Do you know what
the penalty is for stealing?
No, please.
Thank you, kind sir.
l'm so glad you found her.
- l've been looking for you.
- What are you doing?
- Just play along.
- You know this girl?
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.
- She's a little crazy.
- She said she knew the sultan.
She thinks the monkey
is the sultan.
O wise Sultan, how may l serve you?
Tragic, isn't it?
But no harm done.
Come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.
- Hello, doctor. How are you?
- No, not that one.
Come on, Sultan.
What is it?
Come back here, you little thieves.
With all due respect,
Your Rottenness,
couldn't we just wait
for a real storm?
Save your breath, lago. Faster.
Yes, oh mighty evil one.
Part, sands of time.
Reveal to me the one
who can enter the cave.
Yes.
There he is.
My diamond in the rough.
That's him? That's the clown
we've been waiting for?
Let's have the guards extend him
an invitation to the palace.
- Shall we?
- Swell.
Almost there.
l want to thank you
for stopping that man.
Forget it.
So this is your first time
in the marketplace, huh?
ls it that obvious?
Well, you do kind of stand out.
l mean, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.
l'm a fast learner.
Come on. This way.
Watch your head there.
Be careful.
- ls this where you live?
- Yep. Just me and Abu.
- Come and go as we please.
- That sounds fabulous.
Well, it's not much.
But it's got a great view.
The palace looks pretty amazing, huh?
lt's wonderful.
Wonder what it'd be like to live there.
And have servants and valets.
Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.
That's better than here. Always
scraping for food and ducking guards.
You're not free
to make your own choices.
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...
trapped.
So where are you from?
What does it matter?
l ran away and l am not going back.
Really? How come?
Why, you...
My father's forcing me
to get married.
That's awful.
What?
Abu says...
that's not fair.
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah. Of course.
And does Abu
have anything else to say?
He wishes there was something
he could do to help.
Oh, boy.
Tell him that's very sweet.
Here you are.
They're after me. They're after you?
- My father must have sent them...
- Do you trust me?
- What?
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.
- Then jump!
We just keep running into each other,
don't we, street rat?
Run. Go, get out of here.
lt's the dungeon for you, boy.
- Get off.
- Let him go.
Looky here, men.
A street mouse.
Unhand him.
By order of the princess.
- Princess Jasmine.
- The princess?
What are you doing here?
And with this street rat?
That's not your concern.
Do as l command. Release him.
l would, Princess.
Except my orders come from Jafar.
- You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, l will.
Jafar?
Princess.
- Jafar, l'm stuck.
- How may l be of service to you?
The guards took a boy from the market.
On your orders.
Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?
- l can't breathe.
- Why...
- kidnapping the princess, of course.
- lf you could just... That hurt!
He didn't kidnap me.
l ran away.
Oh, dear.
How frightfully upsetting.
Had l but known...
What do you mean?
Sadly, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.
- What sentence?
- Death.
- By beheading.
- No.
l am exceedingly sorry, Princess.
How could you?
So. How did it go?
l think she took it rather well.
lt's all my fault, Rajah.
l didn't even know his name.
She was the princess.
l can't believe it.
l must have sounded
so stupid to her.
Abu, down here.
Come on, help me out of these.
She was in trouble.
She was worth it.
Don't worry, l'll never see her again.
l'm a street rat, remember,
and there's a law.
She's got to marry a prince.
She deserves a prince.
l'm a fool.
You're only a fool
if you give up, boy.
- Who are you?
- A lowly prisoner like yourself.
But together perhaps we can be more.
- l'm listening.
- There is a cave, boy.
A cave of wonders,
filled with treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.
Treasure enough to impress even
your princess, l'd wager.
Jafar, can you hurry up?
l'm dying in here.
But the law says that
only a prince...
Haven't you heard
of the golden rule?
Whoever has the gold
makes the rules.
So why would you share
this treasure with me?
l need a young pair of legs
and a strong back to go in after it.
One problem.
lt's out there and we're in here.
Things aren't always what they seem.
So. Do we have a deal?
Who disturbs my slumber?
lt is l. Aladdin.
Proceed.
Touch nothing but the lamp.
Remember, boy.
First fetch me the lamp.
And then you shall have your reward.
Come on, Abu.
Would you look at that!
Just a handful of this stuff
would make me richer than the sultan.
Don't touch anything.
We got to find that lamp.
Will you knock it off?
Are you crazy?
A magic carpet.
Come on out.
We're not going to hurt you.
Take it easy.
He's not going to bite.
Thanks.
Wait a minute, don't go.
Maybe you can help us.
You see, we're trying
to find this lamp.
l think he knows where it is.
Wait here.
This is it?
This is what we came
all the way down here to...
No!
lnfidels.
You have touched the forbidden treasure.
Now you will never again
see the light of day.
Carpet, let's move.
This is no time to panic.
Start panicking.
- Help me up.
- Throw me the lamp.
l can't hold on.
Give me your hand.
First give me the lamp.
Yes!
At last.
- What are you doing?
- Giving you your reward.
Your eternal reward.
lt's mine. lt's all mine.
l... where is it?
No.
No!
Oh, dearest. What's wrong?
Jafar has done something terrible.
There there, my dear.
We'll set it right.
Now, tell me everything.
Wake up.
My head.
We're trapped.
That two-faced son of a jackal.
Well, whoever he was,
he's long gone with that lamp.
Why, you hairy little thief.
lt looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece of junk.
l think there's something written here,
but it's hard to make out.
Ten thousand years will give you
such a crick in the neck.
Hang on a second.
Wow, does it feel good
to be out of there.
Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.
Where are you from? What's your name?
Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.
Can we call you Al? Or maybe just Din?
How about Laddie? Sounds like
''Here, boy.'' Come on, Laddie.
l must've hit my head harder
than l thought.
Do you smoke? Mind if l do?
Sorry, Cheetah,
l hope l didn't singe the fur.
Rugman, haven't seen you
in a few millennia. Give me some tassel.
You're smaller than my last master.
Either that or l'm getting bigger.
Look at me from the side.
Do l look different to you?
Wait a minute. l'm your master?
That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?
The ever-impressive,
the long-contained,
often imitated,
but never duplicated...
Genie of the Lamp.
Right here, direct from the lamp.
Right here for
your very much wish-fulfillment.
Thank you.
- Wish-fulfillment?
- Three, to be exact.
lx-nay on the wishing
for more wishes.
That's it. Three.
No substitutions,
exchanges or refunds.
- Now l know l'm dreaming.
- You don't realize what you got here.
- Now l know l'm dreaming.
- You don't realize what you got here.
So why don't you just ruminate
whilst l illuminate the possibilities?
Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves
SCheherazade had a thousand tales
But, master, you're in luCk
'Cause up your sleeves
You got a brand of magiC never fails
You got some poWer in your Corner noW
Some heavy ammunition in your Camp
You got some punCh, pizzazz,
Yahoo and hoW
See, all you got to do
ls rub that lamp and l'll say
Mr, Aladdin, sir,
What Will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order, jot it doWn
You ain't never had a friend like me
Life is your restaurant
And l'm your matre d'
Come on, Whisper What it is you Want
You ain't never had a friend like me
Yes, sir, We pride ourselves on serviCe
You're the boss, the king, the shah
Say What you Wish,
lt's yours, true dish
HoW 'bout a little more baklava?
Have some of Column A,
Try all of Column B
l'm in the mood to help you, dude
You ain't never had a friend like me
Oh, my
No, no
Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Out their little hat?
Can your friends go,,,
Hey, looky here
Can your friends go
AbraCadabra, let her rip
And then make the suCker disappear?
So don't just sit there
SlaCk-jaWed, buggy-eyed
l'm here to ansWer
All your midnight prayers
You got me bona fide, Certified
You got a genie
For a Charg d'affaires
l got a poWerful urge to help you out
So What's your Wish?
l really Want to knoW
You got a list that's
Three miles long, no doubt
Well, all you got to do is rub like so
Mr, Aladdin, sir,
Have a Wish or two or three
l'm on the job, you big nabob
You ain't never had a friend
You ain't never had a friend
Like me
You ain't never had a friend like me
So what'll it be, Master?
You're gonna grant me
any three wishes l want, right?
Almost.
There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.
Like?
Rule one. l can't kill anybody.
So don't ask.
Rule two. l can't make anybody
fall in love with anybody else.
You little punim there.
Rule three.
l can't bring people back from the dead.
lt's not a pretty picture.
l don't like doing it.
Other than that, you got it.
Provisos? You mean limitations?
On wishes?
Some all-powerful genie!
Can't even bring people
back from the dead.
l don't know. He probably can't even
get us out of this cave.
Looks like we'll have to find a way out.
Excuse me.
Are you looking at me?
Did you rub my lamp?
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?
And you're walking out on me?
l don't think so.
Not right now.
You're getting your wishes, so sit down.
ln case of emergency,
the exits are here.
Anywhere. Keep your hands
and arms inside the carpet.
We're...
out of here.
Jafar, this is an outrage.
lf it weren't for all your years
of loyal service...
From now on, you're to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me.
Before they are beheaded.
l assure you, Your Highness,
it won't happen again.
Jasmine, Jafar, now let's put
this whole messy business behind us.
Please.
My most abject and humblest
apologies to you as well, Princess.
At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.
When l am queen,
l will have the power to get rid of you.
That's nice. All settled, then.
Now, Jasmine,
getting back to this suitor business...
Jasmine!
lf only l had gotten that lamp.
''l will have the power
to get rid of you.''
To think we gotta keep kissing up
to that chump and his chump daughter
for the rest of our lives.
No, lago. Only until she finds
a chump husband.
Then she'll have us banished.
Or beheaded.
Wait a minute.
What if you were the chump husband?
What?
You marry the princess, right?
And then you become the sultan.
Marry the shrew.
l become the sultan.
The idea has merit.
Yes, merit.
And then we drop poppa-in-law
and the little woman off a cliff.
l love the way
your foul little mind works.
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.
Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.
Thank you. Goodbye, now.
Goodbye, thank you.
Well, how about that,
Mr. Doubting Mustafa?
You sure showed me.
Now about my three wishes...
Dost mine ears deceive me?
Three? You are down by one, boy.
No, l never actually wished
to get out of the cave.
You did that on your own.
l feel sheepish.
All right, you bad boy.
But no more freebies.
Fair deal.
Three wishes.
l want them to be good.
What would you wish for?
Me?
No one's asked me that before.
Well, in my case...
- Forget it.
- What?
- l can't tell you.
- Come on.
Freedom.
- You're a prisoner?
- lt's part of the whole genie gig.
Phenomenal cosmic powers.
- ltty-bitty living space.
- Genie, that's terrible.
But oh, to be free.
Not to have to go, ''What do you need?''
''What do you need?''
''What do you need?''
To be my own master.
Such a thing would be greater than all
the magic and treasures in the world.
But what am l talking about?
lt's not going to happen.
- Wake up and smell the hummus.
- Why not?
The only way l get out of this
is if my master wishes me out.
So you can guess
how often that's happened.
l'll do it. l'll set you free.
Yeah, right.
l promise. After my first two wishes,
l'll use my third wish to set you free.
Well, here's hoping.
Let's make some magic.
So how about it?
What is it you want most?
Well, there's this girl.
Wrong. l can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?
But, Genie, she's smart and fun and...
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.
She's got these eyes that just...
and this hair.
And her smile...
But she's the princess.
To even have a chance, l'd have to be...
- Can you make me a prince?
- Let's see.
Chicken la King.
No. Alaskan king crab.
l hate it when they do that.
Caesar salad.
Et tu, Brute? No.
''To make a prince.''
ls that official?
Say the magic words.
Genie, l wish for you
to make me a prince.
All right!
First, that fez-and-vest combo
is much too third-century.
These patches.
What are we trying to say, beggar?
No. Work with me here.
l like it.
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?
lt says, ''Mode of transportation.''
Excuse me. Monkey boy.
Over here.
Here he comes. And what better way
to make your grand entrance
than riding your very own
brand-new camel?
Watch out. They spit.
Not enough.
Still not enough.
What do you need?
Yes. Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.
Abu, you look good.
He's got the outfit, he's got
the elephant, but we're not through yet.
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're going to make you a star.
Now, let's see.
Sire, l have found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.
The problem with your daughter.
- Really?
- Right here.
lf the princess has not chosen a husband
by the appointed time,
then the sultan shall choose for her.
But Jasmine hated all those suitors.
How could l choose someone she hates?
Not to worry, my liege.
There is more.
lf in the event a suitable prince
cannot be found,
a princess must then be wed to...
- lnteresting.
- What? Who?
The royal vizier.
That would be...
...me.
But l thought only a prince
can marry a princess. l'm quite sure.
Desperate times call
for desperate measures, my lord.
Desperate measures.
You will order the princess
to marry me.
You will order the princess
to marry me.
l will order the princess to...
But you're so old.
The princess will marry me.
The princess will marry...
What is that? That music?
Jafar, you must come and see this.

Splendid. Absolutely marvelous.
Your Majesty, l have journeyed from afar
to seek your daughter's hand.
Prince Ali Ababwa. Of course.
l'm delighted to meet you.
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He's delighted too.
Ecstatic.
- l'm afraid, Prince Abubu...
- Ababwa.
Whatever. You cannot just parade
in here uninvited and expect to...
By Allah, this is quite
a remarkable device.
l don't suppose l might...
Why certainly, Your Majesty. Allow me.
Sire. l must advise against this.
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.
Just where did you say you were from?
Much farther than
you've traveled, l'm sure.
- Try me.
- Duck, Polly.
Watch it, you dumb rug.
Have a cracker.
Out the way, l'm coming in to land.
Jafar, watch this.
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- lt was lovely.
Yes, l do seem to have a knack for it.
This is a very impressive youth.
And a prince besides.
lf we're lucky, you won't have
to marry Jasmine after all.
- l don't trust him, sire.
- Nonsense.
One thing l pride myself on.
l'm an excellent judge of character.
Oh, excellent judge, yeah, sure.
Not.
Jasmine will like this one.
And l'm sure l'll like Princess Jasmine.
Your Highness, no.
l must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.
This boy is no different
from the others.
What makes him think he is worthy?
Your Majesty, l am Prince Ali Ababwa.
Just let her meet me.
l will win your daughter.
How dare you? All of you.
Standing around deciding my future?
l am not a prize to be won.
Oh, dear.
Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Just give Jasmine time to cool down.
l think it's time
to say goodbye to Prince Abubu.
What am l going to do?
Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.
l should have known l couldn't pull off
this stupid prince wish.
So move.
That's a good move.
l can't believe it. l'm losing to a rug.
- Genie, l need help.
- All right, sparky, here's the deal.
lf you want to court the lady, you got
to be a straight shooter. Do ya got it?
What?
Tell her the truth.
No way. lf Jasmine found out l was some
crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me.
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.
Al, all joking aside,
you really ought to be yourself.
That's the last thing l want to be.
Ok, l'm going to go see her.
l got to be smooth, cool, confident.
How do l look?
Like a prince.
Princess Jasmine?
- Who's there?
- lt's me, Prince Ali.
Prince Ali Ababwa.
- l do not want to see you.
- Please, Princess. Give me a chance.
- Leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.
So how's our little beau doing?
Good kitty. Take off.
- Down, kitty.
- Wait.
Do l know you?
No.
You remind me of someone
l met in the marketplace.
The marketplace?
l have servants who go
to the marketplace for me.
Why, l even have servants who
go to the marketplace for my servants.
So it couldn't have been me you met.
No.
- l guess not.
- Enough about you. Talk about her.
She's smart, fun. The hair, the eyes.
Anything. Pick a feature.
Princess Jasmine, you're very...
Wonderful. Magnificent. Punctual.
- Punctual.
- Sorry.
- Beautiful.
- Nice recovery.
- l'm rich too, you know.
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.
- l know.
A fine prize for any prince to marry.
Right. A prince like me.
- Warning.
- Right. A prince like you.
And every other stuffed-shirt,
swaggering peacock l've met.
Mayday.
Just go jump off a balcony.
- Stop her. Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.
OK, fine. But remember, bee yourself.
- Yeah, right.
- What?
You're right.
You aren't just some prize to be won.
You should be free
to make your own choice.
l'll go.
- No.
- What?
How...
- How are you doing that?
- lt's a magic carpet.
lt's lovely.
You...
You don't want to go for a ride, do you?
We could get out of the palace.
See the world.
- ls it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?
- What?
- Do you trust me?
Yes.

For you and me

- Yeah.
- lt's all so magical.
- Yeah.
lt's a shame Abu had to miss this.
He hates fireworks.
He doesn't really like flying either.
That is...
- Oh, no.
- You are the boy from the market.
- l knew it! Why did you lie to me?
- l'm sorry.
Did you think l was stupid?
That l wouldn't figure it out?
No, l mean... l hoped you wouldn't.
- That's not what l meant.
- Who are you? Tell me the truth.
The truth?
The truth...
The truth is, l sometimes
dress as a commoner.
To escape the pressures of palace life.
But l really am a prince.
Why didn't you just tell me?
Well, you know.
Royalty going out
into the city in disguise.
Sounds a little strange,
don't you think?
Not that strange.
Good night, my handsome prince.
Sleep well, Princess.
Yes!
For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go right.
Hold him.
l'm afraid you've worn out your welcome,
Prince Abubu.
- Why you dirty, rotten...
- Make sure he's never found.
Never fails. Get in the bath and
there's a rub at the lamp. Hello?
Al?
Kid, snap out of it.
l can't help you unless you make a wish.
You have to say,
''Genie, l want you to save my life.'' OK?
Come on, Aladdin.
l'll take that as a yes.
Up scope.
Don't you scare me like that.
Genie, l...
- Thanks, Genie.
- Oh, Al.
l'm getting kind of fond of you, kid.
Not that l want to pick out curtains.
Oh, Father.
l just had the most wonderful time.
- l'm so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.
l have chosen a husband for you.
- What?
- You will wed Jafar.
You're speechless, l see.
A fine quality in a wife.
l will never marry you.
- Father, l choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali left.
Better check your crystal ball again.
- Prince Ali.
- How in the...
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.
What ridiculous nonsense, Your Highness.
He's obviously lying.
Obviously lying.
- Father, what's wrong with you?
- l know what's wrong.
- Oh, my.
- Your Highness.
Jafar's been controlling you with this.
What? Jafar?
You low traitor.
Your Majesty, all this can be explained.
- Guards.
- Well, that's it. We're dead.
Just dig a grave for both of us.
Arrest Jafar at once.
This is not done yet, boy.
Find him. Search everywhere.
- Jasmine, are you all right?
- Yes.
Jafar, my most trusted counselor,
plotting against me all this time.
This is horrible, just horrible.
How will l ever...
Can this be true?
My daughter has finally chosen a suitor?
Praise Allah.
You brilliant boy.
l could kiss you.
l won't. l'll leave that to my...
But you two will be wed at once.
Yes, and you'll be happy and prosperous.
And then you, my boy,
will become sultan.
- Sultan?
- Yes. A fine youth such as yourself.
A person of your
unimpeachable moral character
is exactly what this kingdom needs.
We got to get out of here.
l got to start packing.
Only essentials. We gotta travel light.
Bring the guns, the knives...
And how about this picture?
l don't know.
l think l'm making a weird face.
Oh, boy.
He's cracked. He's gone nuts.
Get a grip.
Good grip.
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that urchin Aladdin.
He has the lamp, lago.
- Why, that miserable...
- But you will relieve him of it.
Me?
Sultan?
They want me to be sultan?
Hail the Conquering hero
You've just won
the heart of the princess.
What are you going to do next?
Your line is,
''l'm going to free the genie.''
- Any time.
- Genie...
- l can't.
- Sure you can.
You just go, ''Genie, l wish you free.''
l'm serious.
Look, l'm sorry, l really am.
But they want to make me sultan.
No, they want to make Prince Ali sultan.
Without you, l'm just Aladdin.
- Al, you won.
- Because of you.
People only think l'm worth anything
because of you.
What if they find out l'm not a prince?
What if Jasmine finds out?
l'd lose her.
l can't keep this up on my own.
l can't wish you free.
l understand.
After all, you've lied to everyone else.
l was beginning to feel left out.
Now, if you'll excuse me, master.
Genie, l'm really sorry.
Well, fine. Then just stay in there.
What are you guys looking at?
Look, l...
Abu, l'm sorry. l didn't...
Wait. Come on.
What am l doing?
Genie's right.
l got to tell Jasmine the truth.
Ali, will you come here?
Here goes.
Jasmine, where are you?
- Out in the menagerie. Hurry.
- l'm coming.
You got a problem, pinky?
Jerk.
Jafar's going to be happy to see you.
- Excellent work, lago.
- Ah, go on.
No, really. On a scale of one to ten,
you are an eleven.
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.
l'm embarrassed. l'm blushing.
People of Agrabah,
my daughter
has finally chosen a suitor.
- He is a man of integrity.
- Jasmine?
Ali, where you have you been?
There's something l gotta tell you.
The whole kingdom has turned out
for Father's announcement.
Jasmine, listen to me.
Please, you don't understand.
- Good luck.
- Prince Ali Ababwa.
Look at them.
Cheering that little pipsqueak.
Let them cheer.
You know, Al, l'm getting really...
l don't think you're him.
Tonight the part of Al will be played
by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man.
- l am your master now.
- l was afraid of that.
Genie, grant me my first wish.
l wish to rule on high. As sultan.
Bless my soul.
What is this? What's going on?
- Oh, my goodness. What's happened?
- Father!
Jafar, you vile betrayer.
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.
Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.
- The lamp.
- Finders keepers, Abubu.
Genie, no!
Sorry, kid. l got a new master now.
Jafar, l order you to stop.
But there's a new order now. My order.
Finally you will bow to me.
We will never bow to you.
Why am l not surprised?
lf you won't bow before a sultan,
then you will cower before a sorcerer.
Genie, my second wish.
l wish to be the most powerful
sorcerer in the world.
Genie, stop.
Ladies and gentlemen,
a warm Agrabah welcome
for sorcerer Jafar.
Now, where were we?
Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.
Down, boy.
Oh, Princess. There's someone
l'm dying to introduce you to.
Get your hands off her.
PrinCe Ali, yes it is he
But not as you knoW him
Read my lips
And Come to grips With reality
Yes, meet a blast from your past
Whose lies Were too good to last
Say hello to your preCious PrinCe Ali
Or should we say Aladdin?
l tried to tell you. l'm just...
So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin
Just a Con, need l go on?
Take it from me
His personality flaWs
Give me adequate Cause
To send him paCking on a one-Way trip
So his prospeCts take a terminal dip
His assets frozen, the venue Chosen
ls the ends of the earth, Whoopee!
- So long
- Goodbye. See ya.
Ex-PrinCe Ali
This is all my fault.
l should have freed the genie
when l had the chance.
Are you OK?
l'm sorry, Abu.
l made a mess of everything. Somehow.
Got to go back and set things right.
Carpet.
Abu, start digging.
That's it.
Yeah! All right.
Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go.
Puppet ruler want a cracker?
Here. Here's your cracker.
Shove 'em down your throat.
Here, have lots of crackers.
Stop it. Jafar, leave him alone.
lt pains me to see you
reduced to this, Jasmine.
A beautiful desert bloom
such as yourself
should be on the arm
of the most powerful man in the world.
What do you say, my dear?
Why, with you as my queen...
Never.
l'll teach you some respect.
No. Genie.
l have decided to make my final wish.
l wish for Princess Jasmine
to fall desperately in love with me.
Master, there are a few addendas,
some quid pro quos.
Don't talk back, you big blue lout.
You will do what l order
you to do, slave.
l never realized
how incredibly handsome you are.
That's better.
Now, pussycat,
tell me more about myself.
You're tall, dark.
Well-dressed.
Al. Little buddy.
l love...
- What are you going to do?
- l'm a street rat, remember?
- l'll improvise.
- Cute little gaps between your teeth.
Go on.
And your beard is so...
twisted.
You've stolen my heart.
And the street rat?
What street rat?
That was...
You.
How many times
do l have to kill you, boy?
Get the lamp.
No.
Princess, your time is up.
Nice shot, Jafar.
Don't toy with me.
Things are unraveling fast now, boy.
Get the point?
l'm just getting warmed up.
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?
A snake, am l?
Perhaps you'd like to see
how snakelike l can be.
Stick that sword into that snake.
You stay out of this.
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
lf he can't do it...
Great!
Jasmine, hang on.
You little fool.
You thought you could defeat
the most powerful being on Earth.
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a...
Without the genie, boy, you're nothing.
The genie.
The genie has more power
than you'll ever have.
- What?
- He gave you your power.
- He can take it away.
- Al, why are you bringing me into this?
Face it, Jafar.
You're still just second-best.
You're right.
His power does exceed my own.
But not for long.
The boy's crazy.
He's a little punch-drunk.
- One too many hits with the snake.
- Slave, l make my third wish.
l wish to be an all-powerful genie.
All right. Your wish is my command.
Way to go, Al.
Yes.
The power.
The absolute power.
- What have you done?
- Trust me.
The universe is mine to command.
To control.
Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?
You wanted to be a genie? You got it.
- What?
- And everything that goes with it.
No.
- l'm getting out of here.
- Phenomenal cosmic powers.
ltty-bitty living space.
Al, you little genius, you.
Get your blasted beak out of my face.
- Shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.
Allow me. Ten thousand years in a cave
of wonders ought to chill him out.
Shut up.
l'm sorry l lied to you
about being a prince.
l know why you did.
Well, l guess this is goodbye.
That stupid law. This isn't fair.
l love you.
Al, no problem.
You still got one wish left.
Say the word and you're a prince again.
But what about your freedom?
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.
This is love.
Al, you're not going to find another
girl like her in a million years.
Believe me, l know. l've looked.
Jasmine, l do love you.
But l got to stop pretending
to be something l'm not.
l understand.
- Genie, l wish for your freedom.
- One prince pedigree coming up.
- What?
- Genie, you're free.
l'm free.
Quick, wish for something outrageous.
Say, ''l want the Nile.'' Try that.
- l wish for the Nile.
- No way.
Oh, does that feel good!
l'm free. l'm free at last.
l'm hitting the road.
l'm off to see the world.
l'm going to miss you.
Me too, Al.
No matter what anybody says,
you'll always be a prince to me.
That's right. You've certainly proven
your worth as far as l'm concerned.
lt's that law that's the problem.
- Father?
- Well, am l sultan or am l sultan?
From this day forth, the princess
shall marry whoever she deems worthy.
Him. l choose...
l choose you, Aladdin.
Call me Al.
All of you, come over here.
Big group hug.
Do you mind if l kiss the monkey?
Hairball.
Well, l can't do any more damage around
this Popsicle stand. l'm out of here.
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds.
Hey, Rugman, Ciao, l'm history.
No, l'm mythology.
l don't care what l am. l'm free.
A Whole neW World
A Whole neW life
For you and me
Made you look.
We're under attack!
Light the signal!
- Light the fire now!
- Light the signal!
Now all of China knows you're here.
Perfect.
Your Majesty, the Huns have
crossed our northern border.
Impossible. No one can get
through the Great Wall.
Shan-Yu is leading them.
We'll set up defenses around
your palace immediately.
No. Send your troops
to protect my people.
- Chi Fu.
- Yes, Your Highness?
Deliver conscription notices
throughout all the provinces.
Call up reserves and as many
new recruits as possible.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, but
I believe my troops can stop him.
I won't take any chances, General.
A single grain of rice
can tip the scale.
One man may be the difference
between victory and defeat.
"Quiet and demure.
"Graceful. Polite.
"Delicate.
Refined. Poised.
Punctual."
Ai-yah! Little Brother!
Little Brother. Lit...
Ah! There you are.
Who's the smartest doggy
in the world?
Come on, smart boy.
Can you help me
with my chores today?
Honorable ancestors,
please help Mulan
impress the matchmaker today.
Please.
Please help her.
Father, I brought your... Whoa!
- Mulan.
- I brought a spare.
The doctor said three cups
of tea in the morning...
- Mulan.
...and three at night.
Mulan, you should already be in town.
We are counting on you
to uphold the family honor.
Don't worry, Father.
I won't let you down.
- Wish me luck.
- Hurry!
I'm going to... pray some more.
Fa Li, is your daughter here yet?
The matchmaker
is not a patient woman.
Of all days to be late.
I should have prayed
to the ancestors for luck.
How lucky can they be?
They're dead.
Besides, I've got
all the luck we'll need.
This is your chance
to prove yourself.
Grandma, no!
Yep, this cricket's a lucky one!
I'm here.
What? But, Mama, I had to...
None of your excuses.
Now, let's get you cleaned up.
It's freezing.
It would have been warm
if you were here on time.
Mulan, what's this?
Uh, notes.
In case I forget something.
Hold this.
We'll need more luck than I thought.
Huh?
- Calm.
- Obedient.
There. You're ready.
Not yet.
An apple for serenity.
A pendant for balance.
"Fa Mulan."
"Fa Mulan."
- Present.
- Speaking without permission.
Oops.
Who spit in her bean curd?
Huh. Hmm.
Mmm. Too skinny.
Hmph! Not good for bearing sons.
Recite the final admonition.
Mm-hmm.
Well?
Fulfill your duties calmly and...
respectfully.
Um, reflect before you snack...
Act! This shall bring you
honor and glory.
Hmm. This way.
Now, pour the tea.
To please your future in-laws,
you must demonstrate
a sense of dignity...
...and refinement.
You must also be poised.
Um, pardon me.
And silent!
Ahhh.
Could I just take that back?
One moment.
Why, you clumsy...
Whoo! Whoo!
Aaah! Whoo! Aaah!
I think it's going well, don't you?
Put it out! Put it out! Put it out!
You are a disgrace!
You may look like a bride,
but you will never
bring your family honor!
My, my.
What beautiful blossoms
we have this year.
But look.
This one's late.
But I'll bet that when it blooms,
it will be the most beautiful of all.
What is it?
Mulan.
Stay inside.
Citizens, I bring a proclamation
from the imperial city.
The Huns have invaded China.
By order of the emperor,
one man from every family
must serve in the Imperial army.
The Hsiao family.
The Yi family.
I will serve the emperor
in my father's place.
The Fa family.
No!
I am ready to serve the emperor.
- Father, you can't go.
- Mulan!
Please, sir, my father
has already fought bravely...
Silence! You would do well
to teach your daughter
to hold her tongue in a man's presence.
Mulan, you dishonor me.
Report tomorrow
to the Wu Zhong camp.
Yes, sir.
The Chu family!
The Wen family!
The Chang family!
- You shouldn't have to go!
- Mulan...
There are plenty of young men
to fight for China.
It is an honor to protect
my country and my family.
So, you'll die for honor.
I will die doing what's right.
- But if you...
- I know my place!
It is time you learned yours.
Mulan is gone!
What?
It can't be.
Mulan!
No.
You must go after her.
She could be killed.
If I reveal her,
she will be.
Ancestors, hear our prayer.
Watch over Mulan.
Mushu, awaken!
I live!
So, tell me what mortal needs
my protection, Great Ancestor.
- Just say the word and I'm there.
- Mushu...
Let me say somethin'. Anybody who's
foolish enough to threaten our family,
vengeance will be mine!
Mushu!
These are the family guardians.
They...
protect the family.
And you, o demoted one?
I... ring the gong.
That's right.
Now, wake up the ancestors.
One family reunion
comin' right up.
Okay, people, look alive.
Let's go. Come on. Get up.
Let's move it. Rise and shine.
Y'all way past the beauty sleep thing,
trust me.
I knew it. I knew it!
That Mulan was a troublemaker
from the start!
Don't look at me. She gets it
from your side of the family.
She's trying to help her father.
If she's discovered,
Fa Zhou will be forever shamed.
Dishonor will come to the family.
Traditional values will disintegrate.
- Not to mention, they'll lose the farm.
- My children never caused such trouble.
- They all became acupuncturists.
- Well, we can't all be acupuncturists.
No! Your great-granddaughter
had to be a cross-dresser!
- Let a guardian bring her back.
- Yes, awaken the most cunning.
No, the swiftest.
- No, send the wisest.
- Silence!
We must send
the most powerful of all.
Okay, okay, I get the drift.
I'll go.
Y'all don't think I can do it.
Watch this here.
Aha! Jump back.
I'm pretty hot, huh?
Don't make me singe nobody
to prove no point.
You had your chance
to protect the Fa family.
Your misguidance
led Fa Deng to disaster.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
And your point is?
The point is we will be sending
a real dragon to retrieve Mulan.
What? What?
I'm a real dragon!
You are not worthy of this spot.
Now, awaken the great stone dragon.
So you'll get back to me
on the job thing?
Just one chance.
Is that too much to ask?
It's not like it'll kill ya.
Yo, Rocky, wake up!
Ya gotta go fetch Mulan!
Come on, boy!
Go get her! Go on!
Come on.
Hello?
Hel-lo!
Hello!
Uh-oh.
Uh, Stony?
Stony? Oh, man, they're gonna kill me.
Great stone dragon,
have you awakened?
Uh, uh, uh, uh...
Yes, I just woke up!
I'm... I am the great stone dragon.
Good morning!
I will go forth and fetch Mulan.
Did... Did I mention that
I was the great stone dragon?
Go! The fate of the Fa family
rests in your claws.
Don't even worry about it.
I will not lose face.
Oh. My elbow!
I know I twisted somethin'.
That's just great.
Now what?
I'm doomed, and all 'cause Miss Man
decides to take her
little drag show on the road.
Go get her?
What's the matter with you?
After this great stone,
Humpty-Dumpty mess,
I'd have to bring her home with
a medal to get back in the temple.
That's it!
I'll make Mulan a war hero.
They'll be begging me
to come back to work.
That's the master plan.
Ah, you done it now, man.
Hey, what makes you
think you're comin'?
You're lucky?
Do I look like a sucker to you?
What you mean, "a loser"?
How 'bout I pop
one of your antennas off?
Then who's the loser?
Imperial scouts.
Shan-Yu.
Nice work, gentlemen.
You found the Hun army.
The emperor will stop you.
Stop me? He invited me.
By building his wall,
he challenged my strength.
Well, I'm here to play his game.
Go! Tell your emperor
to send his strongest armies.
I'm ready.
How many men does it take
to deliver a message?
One.
Okay, okay, how about this?
Excuse me.
Where do I sign in?
Ha, I see you have a sword.
I have one, too.
They're very manly and... tough.
I'm working on it!
Oh. Who am I fooling?
It's going to take a miracle
to get me into the army.
Did I hear someone
ask for a miracle?
- Let me hear you say "aaah"!
- Aaah!
- That's close enough.
- A ghost.
Get ready, Mulan.
Your serpentine salvation is at hand!
For I have been sent
by your ancestors
to guide you through
your masquerade.
If you're gonna stay,
you're gonna work.
So heed my word! 'Cause if the army
finds out you're a girl,
the penalty is death!
Who are you?
Who am I? Who am I?
I am the guardian of lost souls.
I am the powerful,
the pleasurable,
the indestructible Mushu.
Oh. Ha, ha.
Pretty hot, huh?
Uh, my ancestors sent
a little lizard to help me?
Hey, dragon, dragon, not lizard.
I don't do that tongue thing.
You're, um...
Intimidating?
Awe-inspiring?
- Tiny.
- Of course.
I'm travel-size
for your convenience.
If I was my real size, your cow
here would die of fright.
Down, Bessie. My powers are
beyond your mortal imagination.
For instance, my eyes can see
straight through your armor. Oooh!
All right, that's it! Dishonor!
Dishonor on your whole family.
Make a note of this.
Dishonor on you,
dishonor on your cow, dis...
Stop. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm just nervous.
I've never done this before.
Then you're gonna have to trust me.
And don't slap me no more.
We clear on that?
All right.
Let's get this show on the road!
Cri-Kee, get the bags.
Let's move it, heifer.
Okay, this is it.
Time to show 'em your man walk.
Shoulders back, chest high,
feet apart, head up and strut.
Two, three. Break it down.
Hup, two, three. And work it!
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- They're disgusting.
No, they're men. You have to
act like them, so pay attention.
Look.
This tattoo will protect me from harm.
Hmm.
I hope you can get your money back!
I don't think I can do this.
It's all attitude.
Be tough, like this guy here.
What are you lookin' at?
Punch him.
It's how men say hello.
Oh, Yao, you've made a friend.
Good. Slap him on the behind.
They like that.
Whoa-ho-ho!
I'm gonna hit you so hard,
it'll make your ancestors dizzy.
Yao, relax and chant with me.
Feel better?
Yeah. Ahh, you ain't worth my time.
- Chicken boy.
- Chicken boy?
Say that to my face, ya limp noodle!
Oh. Sorry, Ling.
Hey!
Whoa! You're dead!
Oh, there he goes!
Hey, guys.
The Huns have struck here,
here and here.
I will take the main troops
up to the Tung Shao Pass...
and stop Shan-Yu before
he destroys this village.
Excellent strategy, sir.
I do love surprises.
You will stay and train
the new recruits.
When Chi Fu
believes you're ready,
you will join us, Captain.
Captain?
This is an enormous
responsibility, General.
Perhaps a soldier
with more experience...
Number one in his class,
extensive knowledge
of training techniques,
an impressive military lineage.
I believe Li Shang
will do an excellent job.
Oh, I will. I won't let you down.
This is... I mean...
- Yes, sir.
- Very good then.
We'll toast China's victory
at the imperial city.
I'll expect a full report
in three weeks.
And I won't leave anything out.
Captain Li Shang.
Hmm.
Leader of China's finest troops.
No. The greatest troops of all time.
Most impressive.
Good luck, Captain. Hyah!
Good luck, Father.
Day one.
Soldiers!
He started it!
I don't need anyone
causing trouble in my camp.
Sorry. Uh...
I mean, uh...
sorry you had to see that.
But you know how it is when
you get those manly urges
and you just gotta kill something,
Fix things, cook outdoors...
What's your name?
Your commanding officer
just asked you a question.
Uh, I've got a name.
Ha! And it's a boy's name, too.
- Ling. How 'bout Ling?
- His name is Ling.
I didn't ask for his name.
I asked for yours!
- Try, uh, uh, ah, Chu.
- Ah Chu.
- Ah Chu?
- Gesundheit.
Ha, ha. I kill myself.
- Mushu.
- Mushu?
- No.
- Then what is it?
Ping was my best friend growin' up.
- It's Ping.
- Ping?
Of course, Ping did steal my...
Yes, my name is Ping.
Let me see
your conscription notice.
- Fa Zhou? The Fa Zhou?
- I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.
Um, he doesn't talk about me much.
I can see why.
The boy's an absolute lunatic.
Okay, gentlemen,
thanks to your new friend, Ping,
you'll spend tonight picking up
every single grain of rice.
And tomorrow, the real work begins.
You know, we have to work
on your people skills.
Rise and shine, sleeping beauty.
Come on. Hup, hup, hup.
Get your clothes on.
Get ready. Got breakfast for ya.
Look, you get porridge,
and it's happy to see you.
Hey, get outta there!
You gonna make people sick.
- Am I late?
- No time to talk.
It's your first day of training.
Listen to your teacher and no fightin'.
Play nice, unless one of the other kids
wanna fight.
Then you have to kick
the other kid's butt.
I don't wanna kick
the other kid's butt.
Don't talk with your mouth full.
Let's see your war face.
I think my bunny slippers
just ran for cover.
Come on! Scare me, girl.
Yeah!
That's my tough-lookin' warrior.
Get out there and make me proud.
- The troops just left?
- They what?
Wait! You forgot your sword.
My little baby,
off to destroy people.
Order. People, order.
- I'd like a pan-fried noodle.
- Oh! Sweet and pungent shrimp.
- Moo goo gai pan.
- That's not funny!
Looks like our new friend
slept in this morning.
Hello, Ping.
Are ya hungry?
Yeah, 'cause I owe you
a knuckle sandwich.
Soldiers!
You will assemble swiftly
and silently every morning.
Anyone who acts otherwise
will answer to me.
Ooh. Tough guy.
Yao.
Thank you for volunteering.
Retrieve the arrow.
I'll get that arrow, pretty boy,
and I'll do it with my shirt on.
One moment.
You seem to be missing something.
This represents discipline,
and this represents strength.
You need both to reach the arrow.
We've got a long way to go.
Hoo-ah!
Hoo-ah!
What do you see?
Black pine, from the high mountains.
White horse hair.
Imperial stallions.
Sulfur, from cannons.
This doll came from a village
in the Tung Shao Pass,
where the imperial army
is waiting for us.
We can avoid them easily.
No.
The quickest way to the
emperor is through that pass.
And besides, the little girl
will be missing her doll.
We should return it to her.
No, this is not
a good idea.
What if somebody sees you?
Just because I look like a man
doesn't mean I have to smell like one.
So a couple of guys
don't rinse out their socks.
Picky, picky, picky.
Well, myself, I kind of like
that corn chip smell.
- Ahhh.
- All right. That's enough.
Get out before you
get all pruny and stuff.
Mushu, if you're so worried,
go stand watch.
Yeah, yeah.
"Stand watch, Mushu,
while I blow our secret
with my stupid girlie habits."
Pfft! Hygiene!
Me first! Me first!
We're doomed!
There are a couple of things
I know they're bound to notice!
Whooo-ooo!
Hey, Ping!
Oh, hi, guys.
I didn't know you were here.
I was just washing. So now I'm
clean, and I'm gonna go. Bye-bye.
Come back here.
I know we were jerks to you before,
so let's start over.
Hi. I'm Ling.
- And I'm Chien-Po.
- Hello, Chien-Po.
And I am Yao!
King of the rock!
And there's nothin'
you girls can do about it.
Oh, yeah? Well, I think Ping
and I can take you.
I really don't wanna
take him anywhere.
Ping, we have to fight!
No, we don't.
We could just close
our eyes and swim around.
Come on. Don't be such a gir...
Ouch! Something bit me!
What a nasty flavor.
Snake!
Oooh, snake! Snake!
Snake! Snake!
Some king of the rock. Aah!
Boy, that was close.
No. That was vile.
You owe me big.
I never want to see a naked man again.
Hey, don't look at me.
I ain't bitin' no more butts.
You think your troops
are ready to fight?
Ha! They would not last
a minute against the Huns!
They completed their training.
Those boys are no more fit
to be soldiers
than you are to be captain.
Once the general reads my report,
your troops will never see battle.
Oh, no, you don't!
I've worked too hard
to get Mulan into this war.
This guy's messin' with my plan.
We're not finished!
Be careful, Captain.
The general may be your father,
but I am the emperor's counsel.
And, oh, by the way,
I got that job on my own.
You're dismissed.
Hey. I'll hold him, and you punch.
Or not.
For what it's worth,
I think you're a great captain.
- I saw that.
- What?
You like him, don't you?
- No! I...
- Yeah, right, sure.
Go to your tent!
I think it's time we took this war
I think it's time we took this war
into our own hands.
Let me see what you got.
"From General Li. Dear son,
we're waiting for Huns at the pass.
It would mean a lot
if you'd come back us up."
That's great. Except you forgot,
"Since we're out of potpourri,
perhaps you wouldn't mind
bringing some."
Hello! This is the army!
Make it sound more urgent!
Know what I'm talkin' about?
That's better.
Much better. Let's go.
Khanny, baby.
Hey, we need a ride.
Insubordinate ruffians!
You men owe me
a new pair of slippers!
And I do not squeal like a girl.
Urgent news from the general.
What's the matter? You've never
seen a black and white before?
Who are you?
Excuse me?
I think the question is, who are you?
We're in a war, man!
There's no time for stupid questions!
I should have your hat for that.
Snatch it right off your head.
But I'm feeling gracious today,
so carry on before I report you.
Captain, urgent news
from the general!
We're needed at the front.
Pack your bags, Cri-Kee.
We're movin' out.
Pack your bags, Cri-Kee.
We're movin' out.
- Huh?
- That's what I said.
nah!
Search for survivors.
I don't understand.
My father should've been here.
Captain!
The general.
I'm sorry.
The Huns are moving quickly.
We'll make better time
to the Imperial city
through the Tung Shao Pass.
We're the only hope
for the emperor now.
Move out!
What happened?
- Um...
- You gave away our position!
Get out of range!
Aah!
Save the cannons!
Come on! Empty it! Empty it!
Hey!
Oh, sure.
Save the horse.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold the last cannon.
Prepare to fight.
If we die, we die with honor.
Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu.
- Hey!
- Ping! Come back!
Ping!
Stop!
You might want
to light that right about now.
Quickly. Quickly!
Come on!
We gotta help!
You missed!
How could you miss?
He was three feet in front of you!
Whoa-ho-ho!
Mulan!
Mulan!
Mulan?
No.
Mulan!
Man, you are one lucky bug.
Shang!
- Do you see them?
- Yes.
Perfect.
Now we'll pull them to safe... ty.
Hey, Mulan!
I found the lucky cricket!
We need help.
Ooh, nice.
Very nice.
You can sit by me.
Aah!
We're gonna die!
We are definitely gonna die.
No way we survive this.
Death is coming!
I let them
slip through my fingers.
Aah!
Pull!
Whoa!
Huh?
I knew we could do it.
You the man!
Well, sort of.
Step back, guys.
Give him some air.
Ping?
You are the craziest man
I've ever met.
And for that, I owe you my life.
From now on,
you have my trust.
Let's hear it for Ping!
The bravest of us all!
- You're king of the mountain!
- Yes, yes, yes!
Ping! What's wrong?
He's wounded! Get help!
Ping.
Hold on.
Hold on.
I can explain.
So it's true!
Shang!
I knew there was
something wrong with you.
A woman!
Treacherous snake!
My name is Mulan.
- I did it to save my father.
- High treason!
I didn't mean for it to go this far.
Ultimate dishonor!
It was the only way.
Please, believe me.
Captain?
Restrain him!
- No!
- You know the law.
A life for a life.
My debt is repaid.
- Move out!
- But you can't just...
I said move out.
I was this close.
This close to impressin' the ancestors,
gettin' the top shelf, an entourage.
Man. All my fine work. Pfft.
Hi.
I should never have left home.
Hey, come on.
You went to save your father's life.
Who knew you'd end up shamin' him,
disgracing your ancestors
and losin' all your friends?
You know, you just gotta...
you gotta learn
to let these things go.
Maybe I didn't go for my father.
Maybe what I really wanted
was to prove I could do things right.
So when I looked in the mirror,
I'd see someone worthwhile.
But I was wrong.
I see nothing.
That's just 'cause this needs
a little spit, that's all.
Let me shine this up for ya.
I can see you. Look at you.
You look so pretty.
The truth is, we're both frauds.
Your ancestors never sent me.
They don't even like me.
I mean, you risked your life
to help people you love.
I risked your life to help myself.
At least you had good intentions.
What? What do you mean
you're not lucky?
You lied to me?
And what are you, a sheep?
Ah!
I'll have to face my father
sooner or later.
Let's go home.
Yeah. This ain't gonna be pretty.
But don't you worry, okay?
Things will work out.
We started this thing together,
and that's how we'll finish it.
I promise.
Uh, home is that way.
- I have to do something.
- Did you see those Huns?
They popped out of the snow!
Like daisies!
Are we in this together or not?
Well, let's go kick some Hunny buns!
Yee-haw!
Make way for the heroes of China.
- Shang!
- Mulan?
The Huns are alive!
They're in the city!
You don't belong here, Mulan.
Go home.
I saw them in the mountains.
You have to believe me.
Why should I?
Why else would I come back?
You said you'd trust Ping.
Why is Mulan any different?
Keep your eyes open.
I know they're here. Yah!
Now where are you going?
To find someone
who will believe me.
My children,
heaven smiles down
upon the Middle Kingdom.
China will sleep safely tonight
thanks to our brave warriors.
Sir, the emperor's in danger.
But the Huns are here.
Please, you have to help.
No one will listen.
Huh? I'm sorry.
Did you say something?
- Mushu.
- You're a girl again, remember?
Your Majesty,
I present to you
the sword of Shan-Yu.
I know what this means to you,
Captain Li.
Your father would have been very proud.
- No!
- Come on!
They'll never reach the emperor in time.
Hey, guys!
I've got an idea.
Boo.
Guard the door.
Your walls and armies have fallen,
and now it's your turn.
Bow to me.
Okay. Any questions?
Does this dress make me look fat?
Ow!
Who's there?
- Concubines.
- Ugly concubines.
Oh, he's so cute!
Ohh...
Now, that's what I call
Mongolian barbecue.
Shang, go!
I tire of your arrogance, old man.
Bow to me!
I tire of your arrogance, old man.
Bow to me!
No matter how the wind howls,
the mountain cannot bow to it.
Then you will kneel in pieces!
Chien-Po, get the emperor!
Sorry, Your Majesty.
No!
Come on!
No.
You!
You took away my victory!
No!
I did.
The soldier from the mountains.
So what's the plan?
- Um...
- You don't have a plan?
Hey, I'm making this up as I... go.
- Mushu!
- Way ahead of you, sister.
Come on, Cri-Kee.
- Citizens, I need firepower.
- Who are you?
Your worst nightmare!
- On the roof!
- Look!
It looks like you're out of ideas.
Not quite.
Ready, Mushu?
I am ready, baby!
Light me.
Huh?
Get off the roof, get off the roof,
get off the roof.
You are a lucky bug.
That was a deliberate attempt
on my life!
Where is she?
Now she's done it.
What a mess!
Stand aside!
That creature's not worth protecting.
- She's a hero.
- 'Tis a woman.
- She'll never be worth anything.
- Listen, you pompous...
That is enough.
Your Majesty, I can explain.
I've heard a great deal about you,
Fa Mulan.
You stole your father's armor,
ran away from home,
impersonated a soldier,
deceived your commanding officer,
dishonored the Chinese army,
destroyed my palace...
and...
you have saved us all.
Ah! Ooh!
My little baby is all grown up
and... and savin' China.
You have a tissue?
- Chi Fu.
- Your Excellency?
See to it that this woman
is made a member of my council.
Member... what?
But...
There are no council positions open,
Your Majesty.
Very well.
You can have his job.
What? I... Oh.
With all due respect,
Your Excellency,
I think I've been away
from home long enough.
Then... take this,
so your family will know
what you have done for me.
And this,
so the world will know
what you have done for China.
Is she allowed to do that?
Um... you...
You fight good.
Oh. Thank you.
Khan, let's go home.
The flower that blooms in adversity
is the most rare and beautiful of all.
Sir?
You don't meet a girl
like that every dynasty.
Mulan!
Father, I brought you
the sword of Shan-Yu.
And the crest of the emperor.
They're gifts,
to honor the Fa family.
The greatest gift and honor
is having you for a daughter.
I've missed you so.
I've missed you, too, Baba.
Great. She brings a sword.
If you ask me, she should've
brought home a man.
Excuse me.
Does Fa Mulan live here?
Thank you.
Whoo! Sign me up for the next war!
Honorable Fa Zhou, I...
Mulan!
Uh... you forgot your helmet.
W-well, actually,
it's your helmet, isn't it?
I mean...
Would you like to stay for dinner?
Would you
like to stay forever?
Dinner would be great.
Come on.
Who did a good job?
Come on. Tell me.
Who did a good job?
Oh, all right!
You can be a guardian again.
Aah-ha!
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Take it, Cri-Kee!
You know, she gets it
from my side of the family.
Call out for egg rolls!
Guardians.
- Oh.
- Thanks, Mushu.
Mushu!
(ABUELA SPEAKING SPANISH)
(ENCHANTING MUSIC PLAYING)
This is where our magic comes from?
Mm-hmm.
This candle holds the miracle
given to our family.
How did we get a miracle?
Long ago,
when my three babies had just been born,
your Abuelo Pedro and I
were forced to flee our home.
And though many joined us,
hoping to find a new home,
we could not escape the dangers
and your abuelo was lost.
But in our darkest moment,
we were given a miracle.
The candle became a magical flame
that could never go out.
And it blessed us
with a refuge in which to live.
A place of wonder.
YOUNG MIRABEL: An encanto.
ABUELA: An encanto.
The miracle grew.
And our house,
our casita itself
came alive to shelter us.
When my children came of age,
the miracle blessed each
with a magic Gift to help us.
And when their children came of age...
YOUNG MIRABEL: They got magic, too.
ABUELA: (CHUCKLING) That's right!
And together, our family's Gifts
have made our new home a paradise.
Tonight, this candle
will give you your Gift, mi vida.
Strengthen our community,
strengthen our home.
Make your family proud.
Make my family proud.
(FIREWORKS EXPLODING)
Yes, yes, casita, we're going!
(YOUNG MIRABEL GIGGLING)
What do you think my Gift will be?
You are a wonder, Mirabel Madrigal.
Whatever Gift awaits
will be just as special as you.

She's kind of a prima donna
Oh, I've said too much
And thank you
But I really gotta go
-My family's amazing
-Mirabel
-And I'm in my family so
-Mirabel
Well
- (MUSIC ENDS ABRUPTLY)
- ABUELA: (SHOUTS) Mirabel!
What are you doing?
Uh, they were just asking
about the family and...
She was about to tell us
about her super awesome Gift!
Oh, Mirabel didn't get one.
(SQUEAKS)
You didn't get a Gift?
- Um...
- Mirabel! Delivery!
I gave you the special
since you're the only
Madrigal kid with no Gift.
I call it the "Not Special Special"
since, uh, you have no Gift.
Thanks.
Oh, and tell Antonio good luck.
The last Gift ceremony was a bummer.
Last one being yours
- that did not work.
- Uh-huh.
If I was you, I'd be really sad.
Well, my little friend, I am not.
Because the truth is, Gift or no Gift,
I am just as special
as the rest of my family.
ISABELA: Who wants more pink?
LUISA: All right, guys,
where do I drop the wagon?
Maybe your Gift is being in denial.
PEPA: I made a rainbow!
WOMAN: Get the chairs out of the way.
(MIRABEL GRUNTING)
Sorry. Excuse me.
PEPA: Dolores, can you hear
if anyone is gonna be late?
Huh? Whoop!
ABUELA: Lift it higher. Higher.
CAMILO: Hey, nice job over there.
- JOS: Yeah, yeah.
- Camilo, we need another Jos!
Jos!
ABUELA: Luisa, the piano goes upstairs!
I'm on it! Careful, sis!
(GRUNTING)
PEPA: My baby's night has to be perfect,
and it's not perfect.
And people are going to be coming.
- And nothing's ready.
- You're tornado-ing the flowers!
The flowers!
Did someone say flowers?
- MAN: Isabela!
- (WOMAN LAUGHS)
FLIX: Our angel, our angel!
Please don't clap.
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's nothing.
(GRUNTS)
A little sisterly advice,
if you weren't always trying too hard,
you wouldn't be in the way.
Actually, Isa, this is called helping.
And I'm not in the way. You are.
(GRUNTS)
- (GRUNTING)
- Whoa.
Excuse me.
Mi vida, you okay?
You don't have to overdo it.
I know, Mam.
I just wanna do my part
like the rest of the family.
- She's right, amor.
- Eesh.
First Gift ceremony since yours.
A lot of emotions.
- Bee stings!
- AGUSTN: And I've been there.
Ay, Agustn.
When me and your to Flix
married into the family,
outsiders who had no Gift,
never, ever would...
surrounded by the exceptional,
it was easy to feel
un-ceptional.
Okay, Papi.
- I'm just saying, I get it.
- Eat.
Mi amor, if you ever wanna talk...
I gotta put out the stuff.
The house isn't gonna decorate itself.
Sorry, you could. You look great.
- Corazon, remember!
- Yeah, remember!
- You have nothing to prove!
- You have nothing to prove!
MIRABEL: Mm-hmm.
(JULIETA SIGHS)
FLIX: Ah, los musicos.
You guys can set up over here.
ABUELA: Clean your rooms!
I don't care how big they are.
TIPLE MAESTRO: Has anybody seen my tiple?
- ABUELA: One hour!
- (GASPS)
Oh!
(GRUNTS) No, no, no!
Maybe you should leave the decorations
to someone else?
No, I actually made these
as a surprise for you. Ooh!
Ooh! (CHUCKLES)
Mirabel, I know you want to help.
But tonight must go perfectly.
The whole town relies
on our family, on our Gifts.
So, the best way for some of us to help
is to step aside.
Let the rest of the family
do what they do best.
Okay?
Mm-hmm.
(WIND BLOWING)
- Pepa! You have a cloud!
- I know, Mam.
But now I can't find Antonio.
What do you want from me?
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
Mam, be nice to Mirabel, okay?
You know tonight will be hard for her.
ABUELA: If the Gift ceremony
doesn't go well this time,
tonight will be hard for us all.
(MIRABEL SIGHS)
FLIX: Antonio!
(SIGHS DEEPLY)
Everyone's looking for you.
This present will self-destruct
if you don't take it
in three,
two,
one... Oh. (CHUCKLES)
Nervous?
You have nothing to worry about.
You're gonna get your Gift
and open that door
and it's gonna be the coolest ever.
I know it.
(WHISPERS) What if it doesn't work?
Well, in that impossible scenario,
you'd stay here in the nursery with me.
(WHISPERS DRAMATICALLY) Forever.
And I'd get you all to myself.
I wish you could have a door.
You know what?
You don't have to worry about me,
'cause I have an amazing family
and an amazing house.
And an amazing you.
And seeing you get
your special Gift and your door,
that's gonna make me
way more happy than anything.
(SIGHS) But, alas,
I am gonna miss having
the world's best roomie.
(GASPS)
(CHUCKLES) I know you're an animal guy
and I made this so,
when you move into your cool, new room,
you always have something to snuggle with.
All right, hombrecito, you ready?

Don't be upset or mad at all
Don't feel regret Or sad a t all
Hey, I'm still a part
Of the family Madrigal
And I'm fine I am totally fine
I will stand on the side
As you shine
I'm not fine I'm not fine
I can't move the mountains
I can't make flowers bloom
I can't take another night
Up in my room
Waiting on a miracle
I can't heal what's broken
Can't control the morning rain
Or a hurricane
Can't keep down
The unspoken invisible pain
Always waiting on a miracle
A miracle
Always walking alone
Always wanting for more
Like I'm still at that door
Longing to shine
Like all of you shine
All I need is a change
All I need is a chance
All I know
Is I can't stay on the side
Open your eyes
Open your eyes Open your eyes
I would move the mountains
Make new trees and flowers grow
Someone please
Just let me know where do I go
I am waiting on a miracle
A miracle
I would heal what's broken
Show this family something new
Who I am inside
So what can I do?
I'm sick of waiting On a miracle
So here I go
I am ready Come on, I'm ready
I've been patient
And steadfast and steady
Bless me now
As you blessed us
All those years ago
When you gave us a miracle
Am I too late for a miracle?

No, that's...
The cracks were there.
They were everywhere.
The house was in trouble,

I would never ruin Antonio's night.
Is that really what you think?
What I think is that
today was very hard for you.
That's... (GRUNTS)
I was looking out for the family.
And I might not be
super strong like Luisa,
or effortlessly perfect
like seorita perfecta Isabela
who's never even had
a bad hair day, but...
(SIGHS) Whatever.
I wish you could see yourself
the way I do.
You are perfect just like this.
You're just as special
as anyone else in this family.
Mm-hmm.
You just healed my hand
with an arepa con queso.
I healed your hand
with my love for my daughter
- with her wonderful brain...

Ay, Pedro.

Cracks in our casita.
If our family knew
how vulnerable we truly are...
If our miracle is dying...
We cannot lose our home again.
(SIGHS) Why is this happening?
Open my eyes.
If the answer is here, help me find it.
Help me protect our family.
Help me save our miracle.
I will save the miracle.
(UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYS)
Wait. How do I save a miracle?
(CREAKS)
I figure out what's happening
to the miracle.
Oh, I have no idea.
But there is one person in this family
who hears everything about everything.
So, if anyone would know
what's wrong with the magic...
- Hey!
- MIRABEL: ...it's her.
Dolores, hey.
You know, out of all my older cousins,
you're, like, my favorite cousin,
so I feel like I can talk
to you about anything,
ergo you can talk to me about anything.
Like the problem with the magic last night
that no one seemed to worry about,
but maybe you heard about that
maybe I should know about.
Camilo! Stop pretending you're Dolores
so you can have seconds.
Worth a shot. Ah!
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
The only one worried
about the magic is you
and the rats talking in the walls.
Oh, and Luisa,
I heard her eye twitching
all night. (SQUEAKS)
There we go.
Everyone, to the table!
Let's go, let's go.
- Luisa.
- ABUELA: Family.
We are all thankful
for Antonio's wonderful new (GRUNTS) Gift.
I told them to warm up your seat.
Thank you, Toito.
I'm sure today we'll find a way
to put your blessings to good use.
(SOFTLY) Luisa, Dolores says
you're totally freaking out.
Any chance you maybe know something
about last night with the magic...
- (GASPS) You do!
- ABUELA: Mirabel!
If you can't pay attention,
I will help you.
- Oh, actually...
- Casita!
(GRUNTING)
As I was saying,
we must never take our miracle
for granted,
so today we will work twice as hard.
- Mm-hmm. I will help Luisa.
- Stop.
(GRUNTING)
First, an announcement.
I've spoken to the Guzmns
about Mariano's proposal to Isabela.
Dolores, do we have a date?
Tonight. He wants five babies.
- (ISABELA GULPS)
- Wonderful!
Such a fine young man
with our perfect Isabela
will bring a new generation
of magical blessings
and make both of our families stronger.
(MAKES KISSING SOUNDS)
Okay. Our community is counting on us.
La Familia Madrigal!
ALL: La Familia Madrigal!

Luisa, hey. What?
- (GRUNTS) Sorry.
- What is your problem?
MIRABEL: Hey! Luisa, hold up!
- (LUISA GRUNTS)
- (BELLS RINGING)
SEORA OZMA: Luisa, can you
- re-route the river?
- Will do.
Luisa, the donkeys got out again.
LUISA: On it.
(GRUNTS)
Luisa! (YELPS)
Wait a second! (GROANS)
You gotta tell me about the magic.
What's going on? What are you hiding?
Nothing. Just got a lot of chores,
so maybe you should just go home.
Luisa, my house is leaning to the...
Dolores said your eye was twitching,
and it never twitches.
Something's making you nervous.
Hey, move. You're gonna
make me drop a donkey.
Luisa, will you just... (SCOFFS)
- Just tell me what it is.
- There's nothing to tell.
You're obviously worried about something.
Luisa, if you know
what's hurting the magic
and it gets worse,
'cause you won't tell me
- what's wrong...
- (LOUDLY) Nothing's wrong!
Wow, uh, sorry.
That... That snuck out there.
What I meant was, um...
Why would anything be wrong?
I'm totally fine. The magic's fine.
Luisa's fine. I'm totally not nervous.
Your eye is doing the thing...
I'm the strong one
I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust
Of the Earth is
Okay.
LUISA:
I move mountains
I move churches
And I glow 'cause I know
What my worth is
Of course, I mean...
Hey, where are you going?
I don't ask How hard the work is
Got a rough
Indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum
I find 'em I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed
I break what's demanded
But under the surface
I feel berserk
As a tightrope walker
In a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like
"Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus"
- (SCREAMS, WHIMPERS)
- Under the surface
I'm pretty sure I'm worthless
If I can't be of service
A flaw or a crack
The straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back
What breaks the camel's back?
It's pressure
Like a drip, drip, drip
That'll never stop
Whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip
Till you just go pop
Whoa
Give it to your sister
Your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things
We can't shoulder
Who am I
If I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to pressure
Like a grip, grip, grip
And it won't let go
Whoa
Pressure like A tick, tick, tick
Till it's ready to blow
Whoa
Give it to your sister
Your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on
A little longer
Who am I
If I can't carry it all?
If I falter
Under the surface
I hide my nerves And it worsens
I worry
Something is gonna hurt us
Under the surface
The ship doesn't swerve
As it heard
How big the iceberg is
Under the surface
I think about my purpose
Can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominos
A light wind blows
You try to stop it topplin'
But on and on it goes But wait
If I could shake
The crushing weight
Of expectations
Would that free
Some room up for joy
Or relaxation?
Or a simple pleasure
Instead we measure
This growing pressure
Keeps growing
Keep going 'Cause all we know is
Pressure like A drip, drip, drip
That'll never stop
Whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip
Till you just go pop
Whoa
Give it to your sister
It doesn't hurt
And see if she can handle
Every family burden
Watch as she buckles
And bends but never breaks
No mistakes
Just pressure
Like a grip, grip, grip
And it won't let go
Whoa
Pressure like A tick, tick, tick
Till it's ready to blow
Whoa
Give it to your sister
And never wonder
If the same pressure
Would have pulled you under
Who am I
If I don't have what it takes?
No cracks No breaks
No mistakes No pressure
(PANTING)
(SIGHS)
I think you're carrying
way too much... (GRUNTS)
Maybe I overdo it.
Yep.
Um... There is something you should know.
Last night, when you saw the cracks,
I felt weak.
(HESITATING) What?
- MAN: Luisa! The donkeys!
- On it!
Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean?
What do you think's hurting the magic?
Don't know, but I heard
the grown-ups once.
Before To Bruno left,
he had, like,
some terrible vision about it.
To Bruno? What was in his vision?
No one knows. They never found it.
But if something's wrong with the magic,
start with Bruno's tower.
Find that vision.
Wait! How do you find a vision?
- What am I even looking for?
- (DONKEY BRAYS)
If you find it, you'll know.
But be careful.
That place is off limits for a reason.
ABUELA: Such a perfect match.
So perfect.
And so good for the encanto.

(GRUNTING)
Hmm.
Casita.
Can you turn off the sand?
(FLOOR TILES RUMBLING)

- What?
Mirabel and I were having this little talk
about me carrying too much.
So, I tried not to carry so much,
but I realized it was putting me behind.
And I knew I was gonna let everyone down.
And I felt really bad,
so I was grabbing all the donkeys,
but then when I went to throw
the donkeys in the barn, they were
heavy! (SOBBING)

What did you do? What did you say to her?
Nothing. I... I don't...

(EXHALES) Clear skies.
Ta Pepa? If... (HESITATING)
If he had a vision about someone,
what would it mean for them?
We don't talk about Bruno.
I know. It's just hypothetically,
if he saw you...
Mirabel, please, we need to
get ready for the Guzmns.
I just wanna know if it was generally
positive or, like, less positive...
- It was a nightmare!
- Flix!
Hey, she needs to know, Pepi,
she needs to know.
We don't talk about Bruno.
He would see something terrible.
And then...
(MAKES TICKING SOUND)
Boom! It would happen.
We don't talk about Bruno.
What if you didn't understand what he saw?
Then you better figure it out,
because it was coming for you.
We don't talk
About Bruno-no-no-no
We don't talk about Bruno
-But it was my wedding day
-It was our wedding day
We were getting ready
And there wasn't a cloud

I can always hear him

And mumbling
I associate him with

It's a heavy lift
With a Gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies
They couldn't understand
Do you understand?

When he calls your name
It all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams
And feasts on your screams
We don't talk about
Bruno-no-no-no
We don't talk about Bruno
He told me my fish would die
The next day dead
CHORUS: No, no
He told me I'd grow a gut
And just like he said
-No, no
-He said that all my hair
Would disappear
Now look at my head
CHORUS: No, no
Your fate is sealed
When your prophecy is read
He told me
That the life of my dreams
Would be promised
And someday be mine
(MIRABEL SCOFFS)
He told me
That my power would grow
Like the grapes
That thrive on the vine

Luisa's gift is fading.
And I think it's all because of me?
P?

(LIGHT MUSIC PLAYING)
- Bye.
- What?
No. Hold on!
Wait! Wait!
- (THUD)
- Ow.
Why did you take the vision?
Knock, knock, knock,
knock, knock. Knock on wood.
- MIRABEL: What does it mean?
- (INHALES SHARPLY)
Is it why you came back or...
- (EXHALES DEEPLY)
- To Bruno?
Knock, knock, knock, knock,
knock. Knock on wood.
You were never supposed to see
that vision. No one was.
- But... (SPITS)
- A little salt.
- Sugar.
- (SPITS)
(BRUNO SPEAKING SPANISH)
Have you been in here patching the cracks?
Oh, that? No, no, no.
I'm too scared to go near those things.
All the patching's done by Hernando.
Who is Hernando?
(IN DEEP VOICE) I'm Hernando
and I'm scared of nothing!
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
It's actually me. (CHUCKLES)
I used to say my real Gift
was "acting." (CHUCKLES)
(IN ALTERED VOICE) I'm Jorge.
I make the spackle.
How long have you been back here?
(SQUEAKING)
You never left.
Well, I left my tower,
which was, you know, a lot of stairs
and here, eh, kitchen adjacent.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Ooh, ooh, plus, free entertainment.
So, what do you like? You like sports?
Game shows? Telenovelas?
(RATS SQUEALING)
Their love could never be.
I don't understand.
Well, because she's his aunt
and she has amnesia
so she can't remember that she's his aunt.
It's like a very forbidden kind of...
I don't understand why you left,
but didn't leave.
Oh, well, because, huh,
the mountains around
the encanto are pretty tall.
And, uh, like I said,
free food and everything.
You guys love the free food, don't ya?
Always hungry. Never satisfied.
(MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)
Yeah, my Gift wasn't helping the family,
but, uh, I love my family, you know?
I just don't know how to...
I just don't know how to...
Well, anyway, I think
you should go, because, um,
I don't really have a good reason,
but, if I did, you'd be like,
"I should go,
because that's a good reason."
Why was I in your vision?
To Bruno?
I just wanted to make
the family proud of me.
Just once.
But if I should stop,
if I'm hurting my family,
just tell me.
- I can't tell you...
- (MIRABEL SIGHS)
...because I don't know.
I had this vision the night
that you didn't get your Gift.
Abuela worried about the magic.
So, she begged me to look into the future.
See what it meant.
And I saw the magic in danger.
Our house breaking.
And then, and then, and then, I saw you.
But the vision was different.
It... it would change.
And there was no one answer.
No clear fate.
Like your future was undecided.
But I knew how it was gonna look.
I knew what everyone would think
because I'm Bruno
and everyone always assumes
the worst, so...
(SIGHS) so...
You left to protect me?
I don't know which way it'll go,
but my guess...
the family, the encanto
and the fate of the miracle itself...
Well, it's all gonna come down to you.
Or maybe I'm wrong.
You know, it's a mystery.
That's why this vision is...
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)
Look, if I could help any more, I would,
but that's all I know.
Good luck. I wish I could've seen more.
Yeah.
Yeah.
(YELPS)
You wish you could have
seen more, so see more!
Have another vision.
Oh. No, no. See,
I don't do visions anymore.
- But you could.
- But I won't.
You can't say the weight of the world
is on your shoulders. The end.
If our fate's up to me,
me says have another vision.
Maybe it'll show me what to do.
Look, even if I wanted to, which I don't,
you wrecked my vision cave.
Which is a problem,
'cause I need a big open space.
- We'll find one.
- Where?
ANTONIO: Use my room.
The rats told me everything.
Don't eat those.
Our family needs help,
and you need to get outta here.
(RATS SQUEAKING)
Meh.
(RUMBLING)
(KIDS GASP, PANT)
You should have told me
the second you saw the vision.
Think of the family.
I was thinking of my daughter.
Pepa, calm down.
- I'm doing my best.
- Yes.
You're lucky it's not a hurricane.
Mam, you've always been
too hard on Mirabel.
Look around.
We must protect our family, our e ncanto.
- We cannot lose our home.
- (DOOR OPENS)
Seora, perdon.
People in town are becoming anxious
about the magic.
They want to see you.
(SIGHS) Mirabel was
in that vision for a reason.
Find her.
- (RUMBLING)
- (BIRDS SQUAWKING)
We might wanna hurry.
You can't hurry the future.
Um... (CHUCKLES)
What if I show you something worse?
If I see something
that you don't like, you're gonna be all,
"Bruno makes bad things happen.
"Oh, he's creepy
and his vision killed my goldfish."
I don't think you make bad things happen.
Sometimes family weirdos
just get a bad rap.
You can do this.
For the nerves.

I can do this. I can do this,
I can do this, I can do this.

BRUNO: It's just the same thing.
I gotta stop!
No. I need to know which way it goes.
There's gotta be an answer.
Something we're not seeing!
You're looking at
the same thing that I am.
If there was something else...
There! Over there!
BRUNO: Butterfly!
Follow the butterfly!
Where is that?
BRUNO: (HESITATING) It's all out of order.
It's the candle.
The candle's getting brighter!
I think you're gonna help the candle!
How?
Uh, there's someone with you. And you...
- You fight her!
- What?
Wait, no, no. Is that a hug?
Am I fighting or hugging?
An embrace. An embrace!
To make the candle bright
you have to embrace her.
Embrace who?
BRUNO: Oh... Almost there.
- Who is it?
- Almost there. Oh, oh.
I got it!
(INCREDULOUSLY) Isabela?
Oh, your sister? That's great!
(GROWLS)
(SIGHS) Every time.
(VISION SHATTERS)
MIRABEL: (SCOFFS) Why would
embracing Isabela do anything?
I don't know. Our family got a miracle.
How do you help a family miracle?
You hug a sister.
Mirabel? (SIGHS) Mirabel? (BURBLING)
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Mirabel?
Well, I think we're running
out of time here.
It's not gonna work.
She won't hug me ever, okay? She hates me!
Also, I don't know if you heard,
I ruined her proposal!
Plus, P.S...
- (WHISPERS) Mirabel?
- ...she is just annoying.
- Of course it's Isabela!
- Mirabel?
What's her problem with me anyway?
She's the one with roses
coming out of her...
(LOUDLY) Mirabel!
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
You see, you're missing the point.
The fate of the family,
it's not up to her.
It's up to you.
You're exactly what this family needs.
You just have to see it.
By yourself, after I leave.
(GRUNTS)
What, you're not coming?
(IN DEEP VOICE) It was
your vision, Mirabel.
Not mine.
You're afraid Abuela will see you.
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Yep.
I mean, yes, that too.
Hey, after you save the miracle,
come visit.
After I save the miracle,
I'm bringing you home.
Knock, knock, knock, knock,
knock. Knock on wood.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
(CASITA CREAKING)
(EXHALES) You got this.
Just gonna save the miracle.
With a hug.
Isa? Hey.
I know we've had our issues,
but I'm (HESITATES)
ready to be a better sister... to you.
So, we should just hug.
Let's hug it out, huh?
ISABELA: "Hug it out"?
Luisa can't lift an empanada,
Mariano's nose
looks like a smashed papaya!
Have you lost your mind?
(SMACKS LIPS)
Isa, I feel like you're upset.
And you know what cures being upset?
A warm embrace.
Get out.
- (HESITATING)
- Everything was perfect.
Abuela was happy. The family was happy.
You wanna be a better sister?
Apologize for ruining my life.
Go on. Apologize.
I...
am...
sorry...
Hmm.
...that your life is so great!
Out.
Wait!
(GRUNTS) Fine! I apologize!
I wasn't trying to ruin your life!
(GRUNTS)
Some of us have bigger problems,
- you selfish...
- (GASPS)
...entitled princess!
"Selfish"?
I've been stuck being perfect
my whole entire life!
And literally, the only thing
you have ever done for me
is mess things up!
Nothing is messed up!
You can still marry that big dumb hunk!
I never wanted to marry him!
I was doing it for the family!
Oh, my gosh.
Isa,
that is a very serious confession.
(SIGHS) Okay, get over here.
Bring it in.
Isa?
(SIGHS)
I just made s omething unexpected
Something sharp Something new
Isa? Uh, this is the part where we...
It's not symmetrical Or perfect
But it's beautiful
And it's mine
What else can I do?
Wait Bring it in, bring it in
Good talk
Bring it in, bring it in
What else can I do?
Let's hug
Bring it in, bring it in
Free hugs
Bring it in, bring it in
I grow rows and rows of roses
Flor de mayo by the mile
I make perfect Practiced poses
So much hides behind my smile
What could I do if I just grew
What I was feeling
In the moment?
Do you know Where you're going?
What could I do if I just knew
It didn't need to be perfect?
It just needed to be
And they let me be
A hurricane of jacarands
-Strangling figs
-Fig!
Hanging vines
This is fine
Palma de cera fills the air
As I climb and I push through
What else can I do?
Can I deliver us
A river of sundew?
Careful, it's carnivorous
A little just won't do
I wanna feel the shiver
Of something new
I'm so sick of pretty
I want something true Don't you?
You just seemed
Like your life's been a dream
Since the moment
You opened your eyes
How far do these roots Go down?
All I know
Are the blossoms you grow
But it's awesome to see how
You rise
- How far can I rise?
- How far can you rise?
Through the roof to the skies
Let's go
A hurricane of jacarands
-Strangling figs
-Go
-Hanging vines
-Grow
Palma de cera fills the air
As I climb and I push through
What else?
What else?
What can you do when you are
Deeply madly truly
In the moment?
Seize the moment Keep going
What can you do when you know
Who you want to be
Isn't perfect?
-But I'll still be okay
-Hey, everybody clear the way
I'm coming through With tabebuia
Tabebuia
-Making waves
-Making waves
-Changing minds
-You've changed mine
The way is clearer
'Cause you're here
And well I owe this all to you
What else can I do?
MIRABEL: Show them what you can do
- What else can I do?
- There's nothing you can't do
ISABELA: What else can I do?
- You're a bad influence.
- (BOTH LAUGH)
ABUELA: (ANGRILY) What is going on?
- (GASPS)
- Abuela?
It's okay! Everything's...
We're gonna save the miracle. The magic...
What are you talking about?
Look at our home! Look at your sister!
Please just... Isabela wasn't happy.
Of course she isn't happy.
You ruined her proposal.
No, no, no. She needed me
to ruin her proposal.
- And then we did all this!
- (ABUELA GRUNTS)
And the candle burned brighter
and the cracks...
- Mirabel.
- That's why I'm in the vision!
I'm saving the miracle!
You have to stop, Mirabel!
The cracks started with you.
- Bruno left because of you.
- (CRACKING)
Luisa's losing her powers.
Isabela's out of control.
Because of you!
I don't know why you weren't given a Gift,
but it is not an excuse
for you to hurt this family.
- (BREATHING HEAVILY)
- (CRACKING GROWS LOUDER)
(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)
I will never be good enough for you.
Will I?
No matter how hard I try.
No matter how hard any of us tries.
Luisa will never be strong enough.
Isabela won't be perfect enough.
Bruno left our family because
you only saw the worst in him.
Bruno didn't care about this family.
He loves this family.
I love this family.
We all love this family.
You're the one that doesn't care.
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)
You're the one breaking our home.
Don't you ever...
The miracle is dying, because of you.

I've never been able to come back here.
This river is where
we were given our miracle.
Where Abuelo Pedro...
I thought we would have a different life.
I thought I would be a different woman.

MAN: (SINGING IN SPANISH)
Two caterpillars
(IMPERCEPTIBLE)
In love
Spend their nights and dawns
Full of hunger
They keep walking
And navigating the world
That changes and keeps changing
Navigating a world
That changes and keeps changing
Two caterpillars stop the wind
As they hold each other
with warmth and consent
Keep growing
They don't know when
To find some corner shelter
The time keeps changing
They are inseparable
And the weather keeps changing
(IMPERCEPTIBLE)
Oh, caterpillars
Don't hold each other any longer
You must grow apart and return
That's the way forward
Miracles are coming
Chrysalises are coming
You must part
And construct your own future
Oh, caterpillars
Don't hold each other any longer
You must grow apart and return
That's the way forward
Miracles are coming
Chrysalises are coming
You must part
And construct your own future
Two caterpillars
Disoriented
In two cocoons
All bundled up
ABUELA: I was given a miracle.
A second chance.
And I was so afraid to lose it
that I lost sight
of who our miracle was for.
And I am so sorry.
You never hurt our family, Mirabel.
We are broken...
because of me.
(MUSIC ENDS)
(HOPEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
MIRABEL: Abuela.
I can finally see.
You lost your home.
Lost everything.
You suffered so much,
all alone,
so it would never happen again.
We were saved because of you.
We were given a miracle, because of you.
We are a family, because of you.
And nothing could ever be broken
that we can't fix... together.
I asked my Pedro for help.
Mirabel.
He sent me you.
(DOS ORUGUITAS PLAYING)
MAN: (SINGING IN SPANISH)
Oh, butterflies
Don't hold each other any longer
You must grow apart and return
That's the way forward
You are already miracles
Breaking chrysalises
You must fly
And find your own future
BRUNO: She didn't do this! Whoa!
She didn't do this!
I gave her a vision!
(GRUNTS) It was me!
I was, like, "Go!" And she was, like...
(BLOWS RASPBERRY) She only wanted to help.
I don't care
what you think of me, but if you're
- too stubborn to...
- (GASPS SOFTLY)

I feel like I missed something important.
Come on.

Where are we going?

It's her! I found her!
I found her!
She's back! She's back, she's back!
JULIETA: Mirabel!
Mirabel!
Mam.
Mi amor, I was so worried.
We couldn't find you.
There were bees everywhere.
I'll be okay.
Uh... Not if we don't have a house.
What? We don't have a house.
I can't say we don't have a house?
What is that? Not a house.
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
Look at this home
We need a new foundation
It may seem hopeless
But we'll get by just fine
Look at this family
A glowing constellation
So full of stars
And everybody wants to shine
But the stars don't shine
They burn
And the constellations shift
I think it's time you learn
You're more Than just your Gift
And I'm sorry
I held on too tight
Just so afraid I'd lose you too
The miracle is not
Some magic that you've got
- (GASPS)
- The miracle is you
Not some Gift Just you
The miracle is you
All of you All of you
Okay so
We gonna talk about Bruno?
That's Bruno?
Yeah There's a lot to say
About Bruno
I'll start, okay
Pepa, I'm sorry
About your wedding
Didn't mean to be upsetting
That wasn't a prophecy
I could just see
You were sweating
And I wanted you to know
That your bro loves you so
Let it in, let it out
Let it rain, let it snow
Let it go
That's what I'm always saying, bro
I got a lot of apologies I got to say
Hey, we're just happy
that you're here, okay?
-Come into the light
-That trip was only a night
And no matter what happens
We're gonna find our way
Yo, I knew he never left
I heard him every day
(CHORUS VOCALIZING)

I think it's everyone in town
ALL: Hey
Lay down your load
Lay down your load
Roll me down the road
Roll me down the road
We have no Gifts But we are many
And we'll do anything for you
It's a dream
When we work as a team
You're so strong
-Yeah, but sometimes I cry
-BOTH: So do I
I may not be as strong
But I'm getting wiser
Yeah, I need sunlight
And fertilizer
Come on
Let's plant something new
And watch it fly
Straight up to the sky
Let's go
The stars don't shine They burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn
Would you watch
Our little girl go
She takes after you
(SIGHS)
Hey, Mariano Why so blue?
I just have So much love inside
You know
I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?
Okay, I'll take it from here. Goodbye!
You talk so loud
You take care of your mother
And you make her proud
You write your own poetry
Every night When you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment
So would you wake up
And notice me
Dolores, I see you.
- And I hear you.
- BOTH: Yes!
CHORUS: All of you
All of you
- Let's get married.
- Slow down.
CHORUS: All of you
All of you
Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
-Neither are we
-That's true
Just one more thing
Before the celebration
- What?
- We need a doorknob
We made this one for you.
ALL: We see
How bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now see yourself in turn
You're the real Gift, kid
Let us in
Open your eyes

That's changing
Never stops turning

As they're together
They hold each other
No way of knowing
They're all they have for shelter
And something inside them is growing
They'll all just stay together
But something inside them is growing
Aye, oruguitas

It's your time to grow
To fall apart To reunite
Wonders await you
Just on the other side
Trust they'll be there
Start to prepare
Don't wait for tomorrow

Never stop changing

In the beginning.
There was only ocean.
Until "Mother Island" emerged.
Te Fiti.
Her heart has greatest
power ever known.
It could create life itself.
And Te Fiti share it with the world.
But in time, some begin to seek
Te Fiti's heart.
They believe the faith could possessed.
The great power of
creation would be vast.
And one day...
The most daring of them all...
Voyage across the vast
ocean to take it.
He was a Demigod of Wind and Sea.
He was a warrior ...
A trickster.
A shape shifter who could change form.
With the power of his magical fish hook.
And his name was Maui.
But without her heart.
Te Fiti began to crumble.
Giving birth to a terrible darkness.
Maui fright escape.
But was confronted by another,
who saw the heart.
Te Ka, a demon of Earth and Fire.
Maui was struck from a sky.
Never to be seen again.
And his magical fish hook ...
And the heart of Te Fiti, were lost to the sea.
Where even know, 1000 years later.
Te Ka and the demon of the deep
still hunt for the heart.
Hiding in the darkness that
will continue to spread...
Chasing away our fish.
Draining the life from island after island.
Until everyone of us.
Is the bowed by the blood thirsted joys.
Of inescaped of our dead.
But one day...
The heart will be found.
By someone who would
journey beyond the reef.
Find Maui.
Delivered him across
the great ocean...
To restore Te Fiti's heart.
And save us all.
Thank you mother, that's enough.
Papa...
No one goes outside the reef.
We're safe here.
There is no darkness.
There are no monsters.
- Master .. master... master.
- There's no monster... no monster.
- Darkness...
- Hey... ahh...
But there is nothing beyond
that reef but storm.
- And rough sea.
- I get the bowed.
As long as we stay on our very safe island.
We'll be fine.
The legend are true.
Someone would have to go.
Mother...
Motului is paradise.
Who would want to go in anywhere else.
Moana.
Oh, there you are...
Moana, what are you doing.
You scared me.
Fun, I wants go back.
I know, I know...
But you don't go out there.
It's dangerous.
Moana, come on...
Let's go back to the village.
You are the next great
chief of our people.
And you do wonderous
thing, my little Minou.
Oh yes, but first...
You must learn where your meant to be.
Moana...
Make way .. Make way.
Moana, it's time you knew.
The village of Motunui is all you need.
The dancers are practising
They dance to an ancient song.
We need a new song,
that's what we need.
This tradition is our mission.
And Moana there's so much to do.
Don't trip on the taro root.
That's all you need.
We share everything we make.
We joke and we weave our baskets.
The fishermen come back from the sea.
- I wanna see.
- Don't walk away.
Moana stay on the ground now.
Our people will need a
chief and there you there...
There comes a day.
When you're gonna look around.
And realize happiness
is where you are.
Consider the coconut.
Consider it's tree...
We use each parts of the coconut.
That's all we need.
We make our nets from the fibers.
The water is sweet inside.
We use the leaves
to build fires.
We cook up the meat inside.
Consider the coconuts.
The trunks and the leaves.
The island gives us what we need.
- And noone leaves.
- That's right we stay.
We're safe and we're well provided.
And when we look to the future...
There you are.
You'll be okay.
In time you'll learn just as I did.
You must find happiness right
where you are...
I like to dance with the water.
The undertow and the waves.
The water is mischievous, ha !
I like how it misbehaves.
The village may think I'm crazy.
Or say that I drift too far.
But once you know what you like.
Well there you are.
You are your father's daughter.
Stubbornness and pride.
Mind what he says, but remember.
You may hear a voice inside..
And if the voice starts to whisper.
To follow the farthest star.
Moana, that voice inside
is who you are....
Aahhh...
Dad.
I was only looking at the boats.
I wasn't gonna get on them.
Come on.
There's something I
need to show you.
I wonder to bring you here from
the moment you open your eyes.
This is a sacred place.
The place of Chiefs.
There would come a time
When you will stand on this peaked place.
A stone on this mountain.
Like I did.
Like my father did.
And his father and every chief that is ever been.
And on that day...
We knew at your stone.
You will raise this whole
island higher.
You are the future of
our people, Moana.
May are not out there.
There are right here.
It's time to be who they need you to be.
We make our nets from the fibers.
(We make our nets...)
(... from the fiber )
The water is sweet inside.
We use the leaves
to build fires.
We cook up the meat inside.
The village believe in us. (Huh)
That's right.
The village believe. (Huh)
The island gives us what we need.
And no one leaves.
So here I'll stay.
My home and my people beside me.
And when I think of tomorrow.
There we are.
I lead the way.
I'll have my people to guide me.
We'll build our future together.
Where we are.
Cause every path leads you back to.
Where you are.
You can find happiness right
(where you are)
Where you are....
Every storm, this roof leaks
no matter how many font I add.
This is not the font.
- Wind shifted the coast.
- Ohhh...
That's good work.
Oh, Amy...
No, I wasn't ...
What? They calling me, so I gotta ...
Bye.
You're doing great.
Is it done yet ?
So close.
I'm curious about that chicken.
Eating the rock.
I mean she seem to like them
basic intelligent required.
Pretty much everything.
So we maybe just cook him.
Sometimes our strange like beneath this.
Far beneath.
In some cases.
But I'm sure this more that
Hei-hei than Misdia.
It's the harvest.
This morning I was
husking the coconuts and ...
Well...
We should clear the diseased trees.
And we will start a new grow.
There.
Thanks Moana.
She's doing great.
This suits you.
Chief.
There's something you need to see.
Our traps in the east lagoon.
They pulling out less and least fish.
Then we'll rooted
the fishing ground.
We have there's no fish.
Oh,...
Then we'll fish far side of the island.
We tried.
The Windworth side.
Amelieworth side.
A Shallow...
Chianu.
We tried the whole lagoon.
They just ... gone.
What you have tried using it for the bait.
I don't using it as a bait.
I would talk to the counselor.
- I'm sure we'll...
- What if...
We fished beyond the reef.
No one goes beyond the reef.
I know. But if there
are no fish in the lagoon...
- Moana...
- And there's a hope.
- In the oceans...
- We have one rule.
In older rule when there were fish.
A rule that keep us safe.
- But dad.
- And stay of endangered our people.
Say you can run right back to the water.
If we time, I think
you'll pass test.
No one goes beyond the reef.
Well, it's like what you said in
front of your dad
Standing on a boat.
I ddn't say, go beyond the reef.
Because I want to beyond the ocean.
But you still do.
- He's hard on you, because...
- Because he doesn't get me.
Because he was you.
Drawn to the ocean.
Challenged by the shore.
He took the canoe, Moana.
He crossed the reef.
And founded unforgiving sea.
Waves like mountains.
His best friend begged
to be on that boat.
He couldn't save him.
He's hoping he can save you.
Sometimes, who we wish we were.
What we wished what we can do.
This is just not meant to be.
I can do this.
There's more fish
beyond the reef.
There's more beyond the reef.
Much so bright.
What ever just happened.
Blame it on the pig.
Grandma...
Are you gonna help dad.
I miss mom.
I don't have to tell him anything.
He was right.
About going out there.
It's time to put my stone on the mountain.
Okay.
Well, then head on back.
Put that stone at there.
Why you trying to talk me all of it.
You said that's what you wanted.
It is.
When I die.
I'm going to come back this one of these.
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.
Why you're acting weird.
I'm a village crazy lady.
That's my job.
Is there something you
want to tell me.
Just tell me.
Is there something you
want to tell me.
Is there something you want to hear.
You've been told all our people stories.
But one.
What is this place?
Do you really think our
ancestors stayed within the reef ?
What's in there?
The answer.
To the question you
keep asking yourself.
Who are you meant to be.
Go inside.
Bang the drum.
And find out.
Bang the drum.
Tatou o Tagata Folau vala'auina.
E le Atua o le sami tele e o mai.
La ava'e le lu'itau e lelei.
Tapenapena.
Olo Olo .. baka.
Aue, Aue.
Nuku i mua.
Te manulele e tataki iei.
Aue, Aue.
Te fenua te malie.
Nae ko hakilia Kainga e.
We read the wind and sky.
When the sun is high.
We sail the length of the seas on
the ocean breeze.
At night we name every star.
We know where we are.
We know who we are.
Who we are.
Aue, Aue...
We set a course to find.
A brand new island everywhere we roam.
Aue, Aue....
We keep our island in our mind.
And when it's time to find home.
We know the way.
Aue, Aue....
We are explorers
reading every sign.
We tell the stories of our elders.
In a never ending chain.
Te fenua, te malie.
Nae ko hakilia.
We know the way.
We were voyagers.
We were voyagers.
We were voyagers.
We were voyagers.
We were voyagers.
Why we stop.
Maui.
When he stole from the Mother Island.
Darkness fell.
Te Ka awoke.
Monster looked and boat stop coming back.
To protect our people,
the ancient chiefs.
Forbid voyaging.
And now we have forgotten
who we are.
And the darkness has continue to spread.
Chasing away our fish.
Draining the life.
From island after island.
Our island ?
But one day.
Someone will journey beyond that reef.
Find Maui.
Deliver him across the great ocean.
To restore the heart of Te Fiti.
I was there that day.
The ocean chose you.
I thought it was a dream.
Nope.
Our ancestors believed, Maui lies there.
At the bottom of his hook.
Follow it, and you will find him.
But ...
Why it'll choose me ?
I don't even know how
to make it pass the reef.
But I know who does.
The clouds are turning black.
What about the fish?
- It happens all over the island.
- Please. please.
- Settle down.
- What are you going to do ?
Who will dig new field ?
- We'll find a way...
- We ...
... can stop the darkness.
Save our island.
This cave have a boat.
Huge canoes.
We can take them to find Maui.
Make him restore
the heart.
We were voyagers.
We can voyage again.
You told me that how our people.
This is how we help our people.
Dad.
What are you doing ?
I should've burned those boat a long time ago.
No !
Don't !
We have to find Maui.
We have to restore the heart.
There is no heart.
This...this is just a rock.
No !
Chief.
It's your mother.
Mother.
What can be done?
Go.
Grandma.
Go.
Not now.
I can't.
You must.
The ocean chose you.
- Follow the fish hook.
- Grandma.
And when you find Maui.
You grab him right here.
You say...
I am Moana of Motului.
You will board my boat.
Sail across the sea.
And restore the heart of Te Fiti.
I... I can't leave you.
There is no way you could go,
that I won't be with you.
Go.
There's a line with sky meet the sea.
And he calls me.
But no one knows.
How far it goes.
On the time wondering well
I need to be is behind me.
Once I know
Every turn I take.
Every trail I track.
It's a choise I make.
No, I can't turn back.
To the great unknown.
I go alone.
Where I long to be....
See her light with the night.

Yes, I know.
I can go.
There's a moon in the sky and the
wind is behind me.
So not know.
How far I go.

- Of course, of course.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Maui always has time
for his fans.
And use a bird to write with.
It's called Tweety.
I know, not every day you got a
chance to meet your hero.
You are not my hero.
And I'm not here so you
can sign my oar.
I'm here because you stole the heart of Te Fiti.
And you will board my boat.
Sail across the sea and put it back.
Yeah...
It almost sounds like you
don't like me.
Which is impossible
because I got stuck here.
For a thousand years,
trying to get the heart...
As a gift for you, mortal...
So you have the power
to create life itself.
Yes, so I believe
you are trying to say.
- Is thank you.
- Thank you ?
- You're welcome.
- But, no, no, no.
I .. I didn't ...
I wasn't ...
- Why were I ever seen you and you...
- Okay, okay, okay...
I see what's happening ... yeah.
You're face to face with
greatness and it's strange.
You don't even know
how you feel.
It's adorable !
Well, it's nice to see that humans
never change.
Open your eyes let's begin.
Yes, it's really me, It's Maui.
Breathe it in.
I know it's a lot the hair, the bod !
When you're staring at a Demigod.
What can I say ?
Except you're welcome.
To the tide, the sun, the sky.
Hey, it's okay. It is okay.
You're welcome.
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy, Hey!
Hey, what has two thumbs
and pulled up the sky.
When you were waddling ye high.
This guy !
When the nights got cold.
Who stole you fire from down below ?
You're looking at him, yo !
Oohh, also I lasso the sun.
You're welcome.
To stretch your day and bring you fun.
Also I harnessed the breeze.
You're welcome, to fill your sails
and shake your trees.
So what can I say except
You're welcome.
For the island I pulled from the ocean.
There's no need to pray, it's okay.
You're welcome.
I guess it's just my way of being me.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
Well, come to think of it.
Kid, honestly I can go on and on.
I can explain every natural phenomenon.
The tide, the grass, the ground.
Oh... that was Maui just messing around.
I killed an eel, I
buried it's guts.
Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts.
What's the lesson ?
What is the takeaway.
Don't mess with Maui when he's
on the breakaway.
And the tapestry here in my skin.
Is a map of the victories I win.
Look where I've been, I
make everything happen.
Look at that mean mini Maui just
tippity tappin'
Well anyway, let me say,
You're welcome
For the wonderful world you know.
Hey, it's okay... it's okay.
You're welcome
Well, come to think of
it, I gotta go.
Hey, it's your day to say
You're welcome.
Cause I'm gonna need that boat.
I'm sailing away... away.
You're welcome.
Cause Maui can do
anything but float.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
And thank you !
Hey, let me out !
- You're lying, slummy, son of the ....

You're welcome.

I'm gonna get my hook.
You have yours. And I'm not Maui
without mine.
Okay, talk to the back.
Boat snack.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't look at me like that.
It's a beautiful cave, she's gonna love it.

Okay, enjoy the island.

And I lost my hook.
Get it away from me.
Get this away.
Hah .. hey .. hey... I'm Demigod, okay?
Stop that,

come for it.
Come for this ... The heart.
You mean this heart right here...
Come and get it.
You are gonna get us killed.
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti.
So you can put it back.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Kakamora.
Kaka... what?
Murdering little pirates.
Wonder, what they're here for ?
They're kind of cute.
Ocean do something, help us.
The ocean doesn't help you.
You help yourself.
You can't sail ?
I ... I am soft touch.
Can't you shift shape

You see my hook.
No magic hook.
No magic powers.
The boat ... is turning into my fault.
Yup.

End of discussion.
You'll to be a hero.
That's what you are about, rights ?
Little girl, I am a hero.

The guy who cursed the world.
Don't know one fellow.
No one.
But, put this back.

Maui Demigod of Wind and
Sea. Hero to all.
First, we get my hook.
Then save the world.

Okay, we go east.
To the Lea of Tomatoa.
If anyone has my hook,

Teach me to sail.
My job is to deliver
Maui across the great ocean.
I should...
I should be sailing.
It's call Wave Finding, Princess.
It's not just sail and not,
It's sea where you're going in your mind.
Knowing where you are.
By knowing where you've been.
Okay, first ...
I'm not a princess.
I'm the daughter of the chief.
- Same difference.

If you weary dress, and you have
animal sidekick.
You're Princess.
You're not away find her.
You're never be away find her.

It's cold.
Wait, it's getting warmer.
Then it's disgusting.
What's wrong with you?
B lack c loud

And for Tomatoa.

And he lives up there.
Oh,ho, no, no, no...
That's just the entrance.
To a Lalotai.

You are gonna stay here

That's what I'm talking about,

Come on, that was a good one,
how you'd not get it.
I called her chicken, that
chicken on the boat.
I know she's human, but that's not.
You know... forget it.
Forget it, I'm not explaining it to you.
What ? Cause that is not funny.
So...
Daughter of the chief.
I thought you stayed in the village.
You know, kissing babies and things.
Hey, I'm just trying to understand.
Why your people decided to send her.
How's my phrases ?
You.
My people.
Didn't send me.
The ocean did.
The ocean... makes sense,
you're what ? Ape.
Can't sail.
Obvious choice.
It chose me.
For a reason.
If the ocean so smart.
Why didn't just take the heart
back to Te Fiti itself.
Or bring me my hook.
The ocean straight up pooky dooks.
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.
You're the chosen one.
The ocean chose you for a reason.
If you start singing, I'm wanna throw up.
So, not seeing entrance.
Yes, because it only
appear after a human sacrifice.
Kidding, Ha..ha..ha...
So serious.
Do not worry, it's a lot far
down there than it looks.
I am still Maui.
Go.
And he's sticks the landing.
What?
Dumb-dumb, she's not even here.
No mortals gonna jump
into the realm of mon...
Well....
She's dead.
Okay, let's get my hook.
Maui's fishhook.
Yeah....
Sorry.
I thought you're a monster, but...
I find your hook and you're right...
- This tomatoa really like the treasure.
- Stay.
What ?
No ?
- I'm... I'm the one who...
- Listen...
For a thousand years...
I've only been thinking of keeping this ...
Getting my hook and being awesome again.
And it's not getting screwed up
by a mortal.
Who have no business
Inside of monsters cave except ...
Except ...
Maybe it's bait.
Hah....
Wow, the shiny glitterin' cave.
And just like me.
It is covered in sparkly treasure.
Sparkle ... Sparkle.

This is stupid, I'm just

You go out there,

Just stick to the plan.
Oh, when he shows up,

Make him talk about himself.
He loves braking about
our gravious.
Maui.
What have we here ?
It's a sparkly, shiny.
Wait a minute...
It's a human.
What are you doing down here.
In the realms of the mons ...
Just blinking eyes, babe.

If you keep ...
Yep, pick one, pick one.
You are funny looking little thing, aren't you ?
Don't, it's my grandma's.
That's my grandma.
I ate my grandma.
Dan it took a week cause
she was absolutely humongous.
Why are you here ?
Cause you're amazing.
And we mortals have heard
the tales about the crab.
Who became a legend.
And I got to know.
How you being so ...
crap....
You less ..
Are you just trying to get me to
talk about myself.
Because if you are ...
I will gladly do so.
In song form.
Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam.
I was a drab little crab once..
Now I know, I can be
happy as a clamp.
Because I'm beautiful, baby.
Did your granny say listen to your heart.
Be who you are on the inside.
I need three words to tear her
argument a part.
Your granny lied.
I'd rather be shiny like a treasure
from a sunken pirate wreck.
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny.
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck
Just a sec, don't you know ?
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters
Beginners. Oh, and here they
come, come, come.
To the brightest thing that glitters.
Mmm, fish dinners.
I just love free food.
And you look like seafood
- No !
- Hey ! Crab cakes.
I'm back.
It's Maui time.
What do you say, little buddy.
Giant hook.
Coming up...
Well, well, well....
Little Maui's having trouble with his look.
You little semi-demi-mini-god.
Ouch ! What a terrible performance.
Get the hook ! ( Get it ? )
You don't swing it like you used to, man.
Yet I have to give you credit for my start.
And your tattoos on the outside.
For just like you I made myself a work of art.
I never hide, I can't.
I'm too shiny.
Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough.
Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny.
Send your armies but they'll never be enough.
My shell's too tough, Maui man.
You could try, try, try...
But you can't expect a demigod.
To beat a decapod.
Look it up.
You will die, die, die.
Now it's time for me to take apart.
Your aching heart.
Far from the ones who abandoned you.
Chasing the love of these humans.
Who made you feel wanted.
You try to be tough.
But your armour's just not hard enough.
Maui ! Now it's time to kick your hiney.
Ever seen someone so shiny?
Soak it in cause it's the last you'll ever see.
C'est la vie mon ami, I'm so shiny.
Now I'll eat you so prepare your final plea.
Just for me.
You'll never be quite as shiny
You wish you were nice and shiny
Hey!
I got something shiny for you.
The heart of Te Fiti.
You can run from me.
Oh, you can't.
You keep surprising me.
It's only so far you can get on
these two little legs.
The power of creation.
For the crustaceans.
Where is it ?
Where is it ?
We gotta go.
Well, what about the heart.
He can have it.
I've got a better one.
Yes, I have the ...
Wait a minute.
I see she's taking Banakaru.
And she's covered with
bio luminescent algae.
Has it devision ?
Come back here.
Hey ...
Hey ...
Did you like the song.
We're alive.
We're alive.
Listen.
- I appreciate what you did down there.
- Mm..hmm...
Took guts.
But... I'm sorry.
I'm tryin' to be sincere for once,
and it feels you're distracted.
- No, no, no way.
- Really.
Cause you looking at
me like I have a ...
Shark head.
- Do you have a shark head, cause I ...?
- Look ...
The point is ...
For little girl, child thing, wharever
who had no business being down there.
You did me a solid.
But you also almost died.
And I couldn't even beat
the dumb crab.
So chances of beating Te Ka.
Bup kiss.
We're never making it to the Te Fiti.
This mission is curse.
It's not cursed.
- Shark head.
- It's not cursed.
Cursed.
What can I say, except
we're dead soon.
We're dead soon.
Can't you at least try?
Giant hook.
Hey, it's okay... it's okay.
We're dead soon.
Alright, play time is over.
Get up.
Why?
You're gonna give me a speech
Tell me I could beat Te Ka cause I'm ...
Maui.
Take a hike, tiny.
How do you get your tatoo's.
They show up when I earn them.
How do you earn that one.
What's that for ?
That's a man's discovery of Nanya,
What's Nanya ?
Non ya'll Business.
I just keep asking.
What's that for ?
You need to stop doing that.
- Back off.
- Just tell me what it is ?
I said back off.
Is that why your hook not working.
You don't wanna talked.
Don't talk.
You wanna throw me off the boat.
Throw me off.
You wanna tell me, I don't
know what I'm doing.
I know I don't.
I have no idea why
the ocean chose me.
You're right.
But, my island is dying.
So I am here.
It's just me and you.
And I want to help.
But I can't, if you don't let me.
I wasn't born a demigod.
I have human parents.
They...
They took one look.
And decided they
did not want me.
They threw me under the sea.
Like I was nothing.
Somehow I was found by the Gods.
They gave me the hook.
They made me... Maui.
And back to the human, I went.
I gave them island, fire, coconuts.
Anything they ever want.
You took the hard for them.
You did everything for them.
So they loved you.
It was never enough.
Maybe the Gods found
you for a reason.
Maybe the oceans brought you to them.
Because it saw someone who
worthty of being saved.
But the Gods are the ones who make you Maui.
You are.
Okay, okay.
I, I love you too, buddy.
Yeah!
Next stop, Te Fiti.
What ?
I figured it out
You know the ocean used to loved
when I pull out violence.
Cause your ancestors would sail the seas.
Find them.
All those new island, new villages...
It was the water that connected them all.
And byway the ocean.
I think I be looking for, ehh...
Curly hair, non a princess.
To start that again.
That is little even nicest thing.
You've ever said to me.
Probably should've said that for Te Fiti.
I did.
Moana of Motului.
I believe.
You have officially delivered Maui.
Across the great sea.
Moana, Moana, Moana.
It's time.
Go, save the world.
Maui...
What... What are you doing ?
Finding you better way in.
- We won't make it.
- Yes, we will.
- Turn around.
- No.
- Moana stop.
- No.
Are you okay ?
Maui.
I told you to turn back.
I thought we can make it.
We?
I thought I can make it.
We can fix it.
It was made by the Gods.
You can't fix it.
Next time will be more careful.
Te Ka was suck on the barely island.
It's lava.
It can't go on the water.
We can find a way around.
I'm not going back.
What... We still have to restore the heart.
My hook is cracked.
One more hit and it's over.
Maui you have to restore the heart.
Without my hook, I am nothing.
That's not true.
Without my hook, I am nothing.
We are only here because you
stole the heart in the first place.
No, we're here because
the ocean told you,
You're special and
you believe it,
I am Moana of Motului.
- You were board my boat.
- Goodbye, Moana.
Sail across the sea,
I'm not killing myself.
So you can prove you're something
- You're not.
- I just restore the heart of Te Fiti.
The Ocean chose me.
The choce wrong.
Maui.
Why did you bring me here ?
I'm not the right person.
You have to choose someone else.
Choose someone else.
Please.
You are a long ways past the reef.
Grandma.
Guess I chose the right tattoo.
Grandma !
That's right, grandma.
I ..
I'll crying to it.
It's not your fault.
I never should have put so much
on your shoulders.
If you're ready to go home.
I will be with you.
Why do you hesitate ?
I don't know.
I know a girl from an island.
She stands apart from the crowd.
She loves the sea and her people.
She makes her whole family proud.
Sometimes the world seems against you.
The journey may leave a scar.
But scars can
heal and reveal.
Just where you are.
The people you love will change you.
The things you have learned will guide you.
And nothing on earth
can silence.
The quiet voice still inside you.
And when that voice starts to whisper.
Moana you've come so far.
Moana listen.
Do you know who you are ?
Who am I ?
I am a girl who loves my island.
I'm a girl who loves the sea.
It calls me...
I am the daughter of the village chief.
We are descended from voyagers.
Who found their way across the world.
They call me ...
I've delivered us to where we are.
I have journeyed farther.
I am everything I've learned and more.
Still it calls me.
And the call isn't out there at all.
It's inside me.
It's like the tide always
falling and raising.
I will carry you here in my heart.
You remind me.
That come what may.
I know the way.
I AM MOANA.
I am Moana of Motului.
Aboard my boat, I will
sail across the sea.
And restore the heart of Te Fiti.
The follow us under water.
We'll make it pass the barely island.
We'll make it to Te Fiti.
None of us, you understand.
Because you are chicken.
No!
Hei-hei.
No, no, no, no, no....
Te Fiti...
Maui.
You've came back.
But your hook.
One more hit, and ...
Te Ka has gotta catch me first.
I've got your back, chosen one.
Go, save the world.
Maui.
Thank you.
Your welcome.
Hey... Te Ka !
Short cut.
Moana.
Get the heart to the sparrows.
Te Fiti.
It's gone.
TE - KA !!
Let her come to me.
I have crossed the horizon
to find you.
I know your name.
May have strong in my heart
from inside you.
But this ... This not define you.
This is not who you are.
You know who you are...
Who you trully are.
Te Fiti.
The chicken lives.
I'm sorry about your hook.
Well, hook. No hook
I'm Maui.
Te Fiti.
How you've been ?
Look, what I did was ....
wrong.
I have no excuse.
I'm sorry.
You know, it will be rude
to physic of the Goddess.
Thank you.
You kind just sure is.
Deeply apreciate.
Gonna missed you, drumstick.
You can come with us, you know.
My people are going to need a ...
master wave finder.
They are already have one.
See you out there, Maui.
See you out there, Moana...
Mom ... Dad ....
Moana...
I may have gone alone.
But always pass the reef.
It suits you.
- She's back.
- Moana....
Moana.
Aue, Aue...
We set a course to find...
A brand new island everywhere we roam.
Aue, Aue...
We keep our island in our mind.
And when it's time find home,
We know the way....
We are explorers reading every sign.
We tell the story...
About our elders in a never ending chain.
Te Fenua, te Malie.
Nae ko hakilia.
We know the way....
Moana
Fear, treachery, blood lust.
Thousands of years ago
these were the...
forces that ruled our world
A world where prey were
scared of predators.
And predators had an
uncontrollable...
biological urge to maim, and maul, and...
Awww!
Blood! Blood! Blood!
Ahhh...
Back then, the world
was divided in two.
Vicious predator,
or meek prey.
But over time, we evolved,
and moved beyond or primitive savage ways.
Now predator and prey
live in harmony.
And every young mammal
has multitudinous opportunities.
Yeah, I don't have to cower
in a a herd anymore.
Instead, I can be an astronaut.
I don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore.
Today I can hunt for tax exemptions.
I'm gonna be an actuary.
And I can make the world a better place.
I am going to be...
A police officer!
Bunny cop? That is the most
stupidest thing I ever heard!
It may seem impossible to small minds.
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.
But, just 211 miles away,
stands the great city of Zootopia.
Where our ancestors first joined
together in peace.
And declared that anyone
can be anything!
Thank you and good night.
Judy, you ever wonder how your mom
and me got to be so darn happy?
Nope
Well, we gave up on our dreams,
and we settled. Right, Bon?
Oh, yes. That's right, Stu.
We settled hard.
You see, that's the beauty
of complacency, Jude.
If you don't try anything
new, you'll never fail.
I like trying, actually.
What your father means, hon, is that it's
gonna be difficult, impossible even...
- for you to become a police officer.
- Right. There's never been a bunny cop.
- No.
- Bunnies don't do that.
- Never.
- Never.
Well... Then I guess
I'll have to be the first one.
Because I am gonna make
the world a better place!
Or, heck, you know. You wanna talk
about making the world a better place,
no better way to do it than
becoming a carrot farmer.
Yes! Your dad, me,
your 275 brothers and sisters.
- We're changing the world.
- Yeah.
- One carrot at a time.
- Amen to that.
Carrot farming is a noble profession.
You get it, honey?
I mean, it's great to have dreams.
Yeah, just as long as you
don't believe in them too much.
Where the heck'd she go?
Give me your tickets right now,
or I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt.
Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!
Baah, baah!
What are you gonna do, cry?
- Hey! You heard her. Cut it out.
- Nice costume, loser.
What crazy world are you living in
where you think a bunny could be a cop?
- Kindly return my friend's tickets.
- Come and get them. But watch out.
Cause I'm a fox, and like you said
in your dumb little stage play,
us predators used to eat prey.
And that killer instinct's still in our denna.
- Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's pronounced DNA.
- Don't tell me what I know, Travis.
You don't scare me, Gideon.
Scared now?
Look at her nose twitch,
she is scared.
Cry, little baby bunny!
Cry... Ow...
Oh, you don't know
when to quit, do you?
Huh!
I want you to remember this moment
the next time you think you will ever be...
anything more than just a
stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny.
- That looks bad.
- Are you okay, Judy?
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
Here you go.
- Wow, you got our tickets!
- You're awesome, Judy.
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't know
what he's talking about!
Well, he was right
about one thing.
I don't know when to quit.
ZOOTOPIA POLICE ACADEMY
Listen up, cadets. Zootopia has 12
unique ecosystems within its city limits.
Tundratown, Sahara Square,
Rainforest District, to name a few.
You're gonna have to master all of
them before you hit the streets.
Or guess what?
You'll be dead!
Scorching sandstorm.
You're dead, bunny bumpkin.
One thousand foot fall.
You're dead, carrot baby.
Frigid ice wall.
You're dead, farm girl.
Enormous criminal.
You're dead.
Dead.
Dead.
Dead.
Ohhh...!
Filthy toilet.
You're dead, fluffy butt.
Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny.
- There's never been a bunny cop. Never.
- Just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny.
As mayor of Zootopia, I am proud
to announce that my mammal inclusion...
initiative, has produced its first
police academy graduate.
Valedictorian of her class,
ZPD's very first rabbit officer...
Judy Hopps.
Assistant Mayor Bellwether, her badge.
- Oh, yes, yes!
- Thank you.
Judy, it is my great privilege to officially
assign you to the heart of Zootopia...
Precinct One.
City Center.
- Yeh!
- Yeh!
Congratulations Officer Hopps.
I won't let you down.
This has been my dream
since I was a kid.
You know, it's a real proud
day for us little guys.
Bellwether, make room, will you?
Okay, Officer Hopps.
Let's see those teeth!
Officer Hopps, look here.
- We're real proud of you, Judy.
- Yeah, and scared too.
- Yes.
- Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo.
I mean, Zootopia.
So far away, such a big city.
Guys, I've been working for this
my whole life.
We know. And we're just a little
exited for you, but terrified.
The only thing we have to
fear is fear itself.
And also bears. We have
bears to fear, too.
- Say nothing on lions, and wolves.
- Wolves?
- Weasels.
- You played cribbage with a weasel once?
Yeah, he cheats like
there's no tomorrow.
You know what?
Pretty much all predators.
- And Zootopia is full of them.
- Oh, Stu.
And foxes are the worst.
Yeah, actually, your father
does have a point there.
It's in their biology.
Remember what happened with Gideon Grey?
When I was nine. Gideon Grey was
a jerk who happens to be a fox.
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.
Sure, yeah, we all do, absolutely.
But just in case,
we made you a little
care package to take with you.
- I put some snacks in there.
- This is fox deterrent.
- Yeah, it's safe to have that.
- This is fox repellant.
The deterrent and the
repellant, that's all she needs.
- Check this out!
- Oh, for goodness sake!
She has no need for
a fox taser, Stu.
Oh, come on.
When is there not need a for a fox taser?
Well, okay, look, I will take this...
To make you stop talking.
Terrific!
Everyone wins!
Arriving, Zootopia Express.
Okay, gotta go.
Bye!
Mmm. I love you, guys.
Love you, too.
- Oh, cripes, here come the waterworks.
- Oh, Stu. Pull it together.
Bye everybody!
Bye Judy, I love you!
Bye!
Bye!
YOU ARE NOW LEAVING
BUNNYBURROW.
I'm Gazelle.
Welcome to Zootopia.
And welcome to the crime family house.
Luxury apartments with charm.
Complementary delousing once a month.
Don't lose your key!
Thank you.
- Oh, hi! I'm Judy, your new neighbor!
- Yeah? Well, we're loud.
Don't expect us to apologize for it.
Greasy walls.
Rickety bed.
Crazy neighbors.
I love it!
Come on!
He bared his teeth first!
- Excuse me!
- Hmm?
Down here!
- Hi.
- O... M... Goodness!
They really did hire a bunny.
Ho-whop! I gotta tell you,
you're even cuter than I thought you'd be.
Ooh, ah, you probably didn't know,
but a bunny can call another bunny 'cute',
but when other animals
do it, that's a little...
Ohhh. I am so sorry!
Me, Benjamin Clawhauser.
The guy everyone thinks is just
a flabby donut-loving cop, stereotyping you.
- Oh.
- No, it's okay.
Oh. You've actually got...
there's a...
- A what?
- In your neck. The fold.
- The... this...
- Oh, there you went, you little dickens!
Hehehe, I should get to roll call,
so which way do I...
- Oh, ball pen's over there to the left.
- Great. Thank you!
Oh... That poor little bunny's gonna
get eaten alive.
Hey! Officer Hopps.
You ready to make the world a better place?
Attention!
All right. All right.
Everybody sit.
I've got three items
on the docket.
First, we need to acknowledge
the elephant in the room.
Francine.
Happy birthday.
Oh.
Number two. There are some new recruits
with us I should introduce,
but I'm not going to because...
I don't care.
Finally, we have 14 missing mammal cases.
All predators. From a giant polar bear
to a teensy little otter.
And City Hall is right up
my tail to find them.
This is priority number one.
Assignments.
Officers Grizzoli, Fragmire, Delgato.
Your team take missing mammals
from the Rainforest District.
Officers McHorn, Ryan Spitz, Wolfard.
Your teams take Sahara Square.
Officers Higgins, Snorlof, Trunkaby.
Tundratown.
And finally, our first bunny,
Officer Hopps.
Parking duty.
Dismissed.
Parking duty?
Chief?
Chief Bogo?
Sir. You said there were
fourteen missing mammal cases.
- So?
- So I can handle one.
You probably forgot but, I was
top of my class at the academy.
Didn't forget.
Just don't care.
Sir, I'm not just
some token bunny.
Well then, writing a hundred
tickets a day should be easy.
A 100 tickets. I'm not
gonna write 100 tickets.
I'm gonna write 200 tickets.
Before noon.
(EXPIRED)
(EXPIRED)
Ah!
Boom!
Two hundred tickets before noon!
Hey, watch where you're going, fox!
Huh!
Hmm.
Where'd he go?
Listen. I know what you're doing
skulking around during daylight hours,
but I don't want any
trouble in here. So hit the road!
I'm not looking for
any trouble either, sir...
I simply wanna buy a Jumbo-Pop.
For my little boy.
You want the red,
or the blue, pal?
Oh.
I'm such a...
- Oh, come on, kid. Back up. Listen, buddy.
- What?
There aren't any fox ice cream joints
in your part of town?
No, no. There are, there are.
It's just, my boy,
this goofy little stinker,
he loves all things elephant.
He wants to be one
when he grows up.
Isn't that adorable?
Who the heck am I to crush
his little dreams, huh? Right?
Look, you probably can't read, fox,
but the sign says
"We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone!"
So beat it.
You're holding up the line.
Hello.
Excuse me.
Hey, you're gonna have to wait your
turn like everyone else, meter maid.
Actually, I'm an officer.
Just have a quick question.
Are your customers
aware they're getting
snot and mucus with
their cookies and cream?
What are you talking about?
Well. I don't wanna
cause you any trouble,
but I believe scooping ice cream with an
ungloved trunk is a class 3 health code violation.
Which is kind of a big deal.
Of course I could let you off with
a warning if you were to glove those trunks
and... I don't know...
finish selling this...
nice dad and his son a...
What was it?
A Jumbo-Pop.
Please.
A Jumbo-Pop.
- $15.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
Oh no, are you kidding me...
I don't have my wallet!
I'd lose my head if it
weren't attached to my neck.
That's the truth. Oh, boy.
I'm sorry, pal.
Gotta be about the
worst birthday ever.
Please don't be mad at me.
Thanks anyway.
Keep the change.
Officer, I can't thank you enough.
So kind. Really. Can I pay you back?
Oh, no.
My treat.
It's just, you know it burns me up to see folks
with such backward attitudes towards foxes.
I just want to say you're a great
dad and just a real articulate fella.
Oh.
Well, that is high praise.
It's rare that I find
someone so non-patronizing.
- Officer?
- Hopps. Mr..?
Wilde.
Nick Wilde.
And you, little guy. You wanna
be an elephant when you grow up?
You be an elephant.
Because this is Zootopia.
Anyone can be anything.
Ahh.
I tell him that all the time.
All right, here you go.
Two paws.
Yeah. Oh, look at that smile,
that's a happy birthday smile!
All right, give her a little
bye-bye toot-toot.
Toot-toot.
- Bye, now!
- Goodbye!
Oh.
Hey, little toot-toot...
"ORGANIC" $2
PAWPSICLE
"ORGANIC " $2
BANCO
BROTHERS
LEMMING
Get your Pawpsicles.
Oh!
- Lumber delivery.
- What's with the color?
The color?
Uh... it's red wood.
39, 40, there you go.
Way to work that diaper, big guy.
Hey. No kiss
bye-bye for daddy?
You kiss me tomorrow,
I'll bite your face off!
Ciao.
Well, I stood up for you,
and you lied to me.
You liar!
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart.
And I'm not the liar. He is.
Hey!
All right, Slick-Nick.
You're under arrest.
Really?
For what?
Gee, I don't know. How about
selling food without a permit?
Transporting undeclared commerce across lines?
- False advertizing.
- Permit. Receipt of declared commerce.
And I didn't falsely
advertize anything. Take care.
You told that mouse the
pawpsicle sticks were redwood!
That's right. Red wood.
With a space in the middle.
Wood that is red.
You can't touch me, Carrots.
I've been doing this since I was born.
You're gonna wanna refrain
from calling me Carrots.
My bad. I just naturally
assumed you came...
from some little carrot-choked Podunk.
No?
Uh, no. Podunk is in Deerbrooke county
and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.
Okay.
Tell me if this story sounds familiar.
Naive little hick with good
grades and big ideas decides
'Hey, look at me, I'm
gonna move to Zootopia...
Where predators and prey live
in harmony and sing Kumbaya!'
Only to find, whoopsie,
we don't all get along.
And that dream of becoming a big city cop,
double whoopsie, she's a meter maid.
And whoopsie number three-sie,
no one cares about her or her dreams.
And soon enough those dreams die, and our
bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor
living in a box under a bridge. Till finally she has no choice but to go
back home
with that cute fuzzy wuzzy little tail
between her legs to become...
You're from Bunnyburrow, is that what you said?
So how about a carrot farmer?
That sound about right?
Oh!
Be careful now, or it won't just
be your dreams getting crushed.
Hey, hey. No one tells me what I can
or can't be. Especially not some...
jerk who never had the guts to try to be
anything more than a Pawpsicle hustler.
All right, look.
Everyone comes to Zootopia thinking
they can be anything they want.
Well, you can't.
You can only be what you are.
Sly fox.
Dumb bunny.
I'm not a dumb bunny.
Right.
And that's not wet cement.
You'll never be a real cop.
You're a cute meter maid, though.
Maybe a supervisor one day.
Hang in there.
Mom & Dad
- Oh, hey, it's my parents!
- Oh, there she is! Hi, Sweetheart!
Hey there, Jude the Dude.
How was your first day on the force?
- It was real great!
- Yeah? Everything you ever hoped?
Absolutely. And more.
Everyone's so nice, and I feel like...
- I'm really making a difference.
- Wait a second. Holy cranks, Bon.
- Look at that!
- Oh, my sweet heaven!
Judy, are you a meter maid?
Oh, this.. No! Oh, no.
This is just a temporary thing..
- It's the safest job on the force!
- She's not a real cop!
- Our prayers have been answered!
- Glorious day!
Ho-ho, meter maid,
meter maid, meter maid!
- Dad! Dad!
- Meter maid!
You know what,
it's been a really long day, I should...
- You get some rest.
- Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Hey, bunny!
Turn down that depressing music!
Leave the meter maid alone,
didn't you hear her conversation?
- She feels like a failure!
- Oh, shut up!
- You shut up!
- You shut up!
- You shut up!
- Tomorrow is another day.
Yeah, but it might be worse!
I was 30 seconds over!
Yeah, you're a real hero, lady.
My mommy says
she wishes you were dead.
How glory are that my tax dollars
pay your salary.
I am a real cop.
I am a real cop.
Hey, you!
Bunny!
Sir, if you have a grievance you may
contest recitation in traffic court.
What are you talking about?!
My shop!
It was just robbed!
Look, he's getting away!
Well, are you a cop or not?
Oh! Yes! Yes!
Don't worry, sir, I got this!
- Stop in the name of the law!
- Catch me if ya' can, cottontail!
Coming through!
This is officer McHorn.
We got a 10-31.
I got dibs!
Officer Hopps, I am in pursuit!
Woo-hoo!
LITTLE
RODENTIA
- Ah!
- Ahh!
Ha ha ha.
You!
Hey!
Hey, meter maid!
Wait for the real cops!
Stop!
Ahhhh!
Oh.
Sorry! Coming through.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon.
Yahhh!
Bon voyage, flatfoot!
Huh!
- Hey! Stop right there!
- Have a donut, coppa!
Oh my god, did you see those
leopard print jeggings?
- Ah!
- Ah!
Oh!
- I love your hair.
- Thank you.
Heheheheh.
Come to papa!
Okay. You're gonna have
to be patient and wait in line
just like everyone else,
Mrs. Otterton. Okay?
- I popped the weasel!
- Hopps!
Abandoning your post. Inciting a scurry.
Reckless endangerment of rodents...
But, to be fair, you did stop a master criminal
from stealing two dozen moldy onions.
Mmm. Hate to disagree with you, sir,
but those aren't onions.
Those are pest riddance called
Midnicampum holicithias.
They're a class C botanical, sir.
Well, I grew up in a family where plant
husbandry was kind of a thing...
- Shut your tiny mouth now!
- Sir, I got the bad guy.
That's my job.
Your job is putting tickets
on parked cars!
Chief, Mrs. Otterton's
here to see you again.
- Not now.
- Okay, I just need to know if you want to...
- take it this time she seems really upset...
- Not now!
Sir. I don't wanna
be a meter maid,
I wanna be a real cop.
Do you think the mayor
asked what I wanted...
- when he assigned you to me?
- But, sir...
Life isn't some cartoon musical where you
sing a little song, and your insipid dreams...
magically come true!
So let it go.
Chief Bogo, please!
Five minutes of your time, please.
I'm sorry sir. I tried to stop her,
she's super slippery.
I gotta go sit down.
Ma'am, as I've told you,
we're doing everything we can.
My husband has been
missing for ten days.
- His name is Emmitt Otterton.
- Yes. I know.
He's a florist.
We have 2 beautiful children.
He would never just disappear.
Ma'am, our detectives
are very busy.
Please. There's gotta be somebody
to find my Emmitt.
- Mrs. Otterton.
- I will find him.
Oh. Thank you!
Bless you, bless you, little bunny!
Take this.
Find my Emmitt.
Bring him home to me and my babies.
Please.
Mrs. Otterton.
Please wait out here.
Of course.
Oh, thank you both so much!
One second.
- You're fired.
- What? Why?
Insubordination! Now. I'm going to open
this door, and you're goind to tell that Otter
you're a former meter maid with delusion
of grandeur, who will not be taking the case.
I just heard Officer Hopps
is taking the case!
Assistant Mayor Bellwether!
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative
is really starting to pay off.
Mayor Lionheart is
just gonna be so thrill!
No, let's not tell
the mayor just yet.
And I sent it, and it is done,
so I did do that.
All right, well, I'd say
the case is in good hands.
Us little guys really need to
stick together, right?
- Like glue.
- Good one.
Just call me if you ever
need anything. Okay?
You've always got a friend at
City Hall, Judy. All right! Bye-bye!
Thank you, ma'am!
I will give you 48 hours.
Yes!
That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton.
But.. You strike out, you resign.
Okay. Deal.
Splendid. Clawhauser will give you
the complete case file.
Here you go.
One missing otter.
- That's it?
- Yikes!
That is the smallest case file
I've ever seen. Leads, none.
Witnesses, none. And you're not in the
computer system yet, so...
Resources, none!
Ha ha!
Hoo, I hope you didn't stake your
career on cracking this one.
Okay.
Last known sighting.
Can I just borrow?
Thank you.
- Pawpsicle?
- The murder weapon!
- 'Get your pawpsicle'...
- Yeah! Cause that...
What does that mean?
It means I have a lead.
- Hi! Hello! It's me again!
- Hey! It's officer toot-toot.
Hoo...No.
Actually it's Officer Hopps,
and I'm here to ask you some
questions about a case.
What happened, meter maid?
Did someone steal a traffic cone?
It wasn't me.
Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the baby.
I gotta get to work.
This is important, sir. I think your
ten dollars worth of pawpsicles can wait.
Ha! I make 200 bucks
a day, fluff.
365 days a year,
since I was 12.
- And time is money. Hop along.
- Please just look at the picture.
You sold Mr. Otterton that pawpsicle, right?
- Do you know him?
- I know everybody.
And I also know that somewhere
there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal,
so why don't you get back to your box?
Fine.
Then we'll have to do this the hard way.
- Did you just boot my stroller?
- Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.
Ha. For what? Hurting
your feelings?
Felony tax evasion.
Yeah.. 200 dollars a day, 365 days a year,
since you were 12...
that's two decades, so times twenty, which is
1,460,000, I think.
I mean, I am just a dumb bunny,
but we are good at multiplying.
Anyway, according to your tax forms,
you reported, let me see here, zero!
Unfortunately, lying on a federal form
is a punishable offense.
- 5 years jail time.
- Well, it's my word against yours.
'200 bucks a day, fluff,
365 days a year, since I was twelve.'
Actually it's your
word against yours.
And if you want this pen
you're going to help me
find this poor missing otter,
or the only place
you'll be selling pawpsicles
is the prison cafeteria.
It's called a hustle, sweet heart.
She hustled you.
Ehahaha...
She hustled you good!
You're a cop now, Nick.
You're gonna need one of these.
Have fun working with the fuzz!
Start talking.
I don't know where he is,
I only saw where he went.
Great, let's go!
It's not exactly a place
for a cute little bunny.
- Don't call me cute, get in the car.
- Okay. You're the boss.
Hi.
I'm...
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
My name is...
You know, I'm gonna hit the
pause button right there.
Cause we're all good on
bunny scout cookies.
Uh, no.
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.
I'm looking for a missing mammal...
Emmitt Otterton. Right here.
He may have frequented this establishment?
Yeah, old Emmitt!
Haven't seen him in
a couple of weeks.
But hey, you should talk to his yoga instructor.
I'd be happy to take you back.
Oh, thank you so much, I'd appericiate
that more than you can imagine, it'd be such...
- Oh! You are naked..
- Oh, for sure. We're a naturalist club!
Yeah. In Zootopia anyone can be anything.
These guys, they be naked.
Nangi's just on the other side
of the pleasure pool.
Oh boy. Does this make you uncomfortable?
Because if so, there's no shame in calling it quits.
Yes, there is.
Boy, that's the spirit.
Yeah, some mammals say the naturalist life is weird.
But you know what I say is weird?
Clothes on animals!
Here we go!
As you can see, Nangi is an elephant,
so she'll totally remember everything.
Hey, Nangi. These dudes have some questions
about Emmitt the otter.
- Who?
- Eh.
Emmitt Otterton. Been coming
to your yoga class for like six years.
I have no memory
of this beaver.
He's an otter, actually.
He was here a couple of
Wednesdays ago. Remember?
No.
Yeah, he was wearing a green
cable knit sweater vest,
and a new pair of Quarterway slacks.
Oh, and a Paisley tie, sweet Windsor knot.
- Real tight. Remember that, Nangi?
- No.
Yeah, and we both walked him out, and he got into this
big old white car with a silver trim.
Needed a tune up. The third cylinder
wasn't firing. Remeber that, Nangi?
No.
Eh. You didn't happen to catch
the licence plate number?
- Did you?
- Oh, for sure. It was 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.
0-3. Wow, this is a lot of great info.
Thank you.
Told you Nangi has a mind like a steel trap.
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.
Well, I had a ball. You are welcome for the clue.
And seeing as any moron can run a plate,
I will take that pen
and bid you adieu.
The plate.
I can't run a plate.
Oomf.
I'm not in the system yet.
- Give me the pen, please.
- What was it you said?
Any moron can run a plate?
Gosh, if only there were a moron around
who were up to the task.
Rabbit, I did what you asked.
You can't keep me
on the hook forever.
Not forever. Well, I only have 36
hours left to solve this case.
So can you run the plate or not?
Actually, I just remembered,
I have a pal at the DMV.
Flash is the fastest guy in there.
You need something done, he's on it.
I hope so. We are really fighting the clock
and every minute counts.
Wait.
They're all sloths?
You said this was
going to be quick!
What, are you saying just
because he's a sloth
he can't be fast? I thought in
Zootopia anyone could be anything.
Flash, Flash, Hundred Yard Dash!
Buddy, it's nice to see you.
Nice to... see you... too.
Hey, Flash, I'd love
you to meet my friend.
Ah...Darlin, I've forgotten your name.
Hmm. Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD.
How are you?
I am...
doing... just..
- Fine?
- as well.. as.. I can.. be...
- What...
- Hang in there.
- can I... do...
- Well, I was hoping you could run a plate...
- for you...
- Well, I was hoping you could...
...today?
Well, I was hoping you could run a plate for us.
We are in a really big hurry.
- Sure... What's the... plate...
- 2-9-T...
- Number?
- 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.
- 2... 9...
- T-H-D-0-3.
- T...
- H-D-0-3.
- H...
- D-0-3.
- D...
- Mm-hm. 0-3.
- 0...
- 3!
- Hey, Flash. Wanna hear a joke?
- No!
- Sure.
- Mmm!
What do you call a
three-humped camel?
I don't know.
What do you call...
- Three-humped camel.
- a three-humped... camel?
Pregnant.
Ha ha ha ha...
Ha ha. Yes, very funny, very funny!
Can we please just focus on the task?
- Hey...
- Wait, wait!
- Priscilla!
- Oh, no!
- Yes... Flash?
- What... do..
- No...
- you call...
A three-humped camel?
- Pregnant! Okay! We got it! Please just...
- - three... humped...
- Here... you...
- Yes! Yeah, yeah! Hurry, thank you!
- 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.
- ...go.
It's registered to
Tundratown Limo Service.
A limo took Otterton! And
the limo's in Tundratown!
It's in Tundratown!
Way to hustle, bud. I love you.
I owe you.
Hurry! We gotta beat the rush hour and...
It's night?!
Closed.
Great.
Mm. And I will betcha
you don't have a warrant to get in, hmm?
- Darn it. It's a bummer.
- You wasted the day on purpose.
Ma'am, I have a fake badge. I would never
impede your pretend investigation.
It's not a pretend investigation!
Look, see? See him? This otter is missing.
Well, then they should have
gotten a real cop to find him.
What is your problem? Does
seeing me fail somehow make
you feel better about your
own sad, miserable life?
It does, 100%.
Now, since you're sans warrant.
I guess we're done?
Fine. We are done.
Here's your pen.
First off, you throw like a bunny.
Second, you're a very sore loser.
See you later, Officer Fluff.
So sad this is over.
- I wish I could have helped more.
- The thing is, you don't need...
a warrant if you have probable cause,
and I'm pretty sure I saw a...
shifty lowlife climbing the fence.
So you're helping plenty! Come on!
2-9-T-H-D-0-3!
This is it!
Polar bear fur.
- Oh my God!
- What? What?
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole!
But on CD.
Who still uses CDs?
Carrots, if your otter was here,
he had a very bad day.
Those are claw marks.
You ever seen anything like this?
- No.
- Oh, wait. Look!
This is him. Emmitt Otterton.
He was definitely here.
What do you think happened?
Oh no, wait a minute.
Polar bear fur...
Rat-pack music. Fancy cup.
I know whose car this is, we gotta go!
- What? Whose car is it?
- The most feared crime boss in Tundratown.
They call him Mr. Big, and he does not
like me. So we gotta go!
I'm not leaving,
this is a crime scene.
Well, it's gonna be an
even bigger crime scene...
if Mr. Big finds me here,
so we're leaving right now.
Raymond! And is that Kevin?
Long time, no see.
And speaking of no see,
how about you forget you saw me?
Huh?
For old times sake?
That's a no..
What did you do that made
Mr. Big so mad at you?
I, uh... I may have sold him
a very expensive wall rug
that was made from the fur
of a skunk's butt.
Oh, sweet cheese 'n crackers.
- Is that Mr. Big?
- No.
- What about him? Is that him?
- No.
- That's gotta be him.
- Stop talking. Stop talking. Stop talking!
Huh.
Mr. Big, sir,
this is a simple misunder...
Hmmph.
Yeah.
This is a simple misunderstanding.
You come here unannounced on the
day my daughter is to be married.
Well, actually, we were brought here
against our will, so...
Point is, I did not know
that it was your car,
and I certainly did not know about
your daughter's wedding!
I trusted you, Nicky.
I welcomed you into my home.
We broke bread together.
Grandmama made you a cannoli.
And how did you repay my generosity?
With a rug
made from the butt of a skunk.
A skunk-butt rug.
You disrespected me.
You disrespected my grandmama,
who I buried in that skunk-butt rug.
I told you never to show your face
here again, but here you are.
Snooping around with this...
What are you? A performer?
What's with the costume?
- Sir, I am a co...
- Mime!
She's a mime.
This mime can not speak.
- You can't speak if you're a mime.
- No, I am a cop.
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.
And my evidence puts him in your car!
So intimidate me all you want,
I'm going to find out what you did to that otter
if it's the last thing I do.
Hmm.
Then I have only one request.
Say hello to Grandmama.
Ice 'em!
No, no, no. I didn't see nothing!
I'm not saying nothing!
And you never will.
Please!
No, no, no, no!
If you're mad at me about
the rug, I've got more rugs!
Daddy! It's time for our dance!
Ah! What did we say?
No icing anyone at my wedding!
I have to, baby,
daddy has to.
- Ice 'em.
- No, no, no!
Wait, wait!
She's the bunny that saved my life yesterday!
From that giant donut!
- This bunny?
- Yeah. Hi!
- Hi. I love your dress.
- Oh. Thank you.
Put them down.
You've done me a great service.
I will help you find the otter.
I will take your kindness,
and pay it forward.
Hmm.
Otterton is my florist.
He's like a part of the family.
He had something important
he wanted to discuss.
That's why I sent that
car to pick him up.
But he never arrived.
Because he was attacked.
No, he attacked.
Otterton?
Otterton.
He went crazy.
Ripped up the car.
Scared my driver half to death.
And disappeared into the night.
But he's a sweet little otter.
My child, we may be evolved,
but deep down we are still animals.
You wanna find Otterton, talk to
the driver of the car.
His name is Manchas.
Lives in the Rainforest District.
Only he can tell you more.
Mr. Manchas?
Judy Hopps, ZPD.
We just wanna know what happened
to Emmitt Otterton.
You should be asking
what happened to me.
- Whoa. A teensy otter did that?
- What happened?
He was an animal.
Down on all fours.
He was a savage!
There was no warning.
He just kept yelling about the Night Howlers.
Over and over, the Night Howlers!
So you know about
the Night Howlers too?
Good, good.
Because the Night Howlers are exactly
what we are here
to talk about. Right?
Yes, so you just open the
door and tell us what you know,
and we will tell you what we know.
Okay?
Okay.
Clever fox.
Mr. Manchas?
Are you okay?
Run. Run!
- What is wrong with him?!
- I don't know!
Jump!
Come on!
Head down!
Officer Hopps to dispatch!
Are you familiar with Gazelle? Greatest
singer of our lifetime. Angel with horns.
Okay, hold on.
Keep watching.
Who's that beside her?
Who is it?
Wow, you are one hot dancer,
Benjamin Clawhauser.
It's me! Did you think it was real?
It looks so real!
It's not, it's just a new app.
- Hold on a second.
- Clawhauser!
Clawhauser, listen to me.
We have a 10-91!
Jaguar gone savage!
- Vine and Tujunga!
- It's Tu-hunga!
Okay, we're sending backup!
Look, over there!
Head for the sky-trans!
Get in.
Carrots? Carrots!
Go!
Buddy, one predator to another.
Now I can tell you're a little tense,
so I'm just gonna give you a little personal space!
Rabbit, whatever you do,
do not let go!
- I'm gonna let go!
- You're gonna to what?
One, two...
Carrots, you saved my life.
Well, that's what we do at the ZPD...
Well, this should be good.
I thought this was just a missing mammal case,
but it's way bigger.
Mr. Otterton did not just disappear.
I believe he and this jaguar,
they...
They went savage, sir.
Savage? This isn't the stone age, Hopps.
Animals don't go savage.
I thought so too.
Till I saw this.
What?
He was right here!
The savage jaguar?
Sir, I know what I saw.
He almost killed us!
Or maybe any agressive predator
looks savage to rabbits?
Let's go!
Wait! Sir!
I'm not the only one who saw him.
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?
Well, he was a key witness, and I...
Two days to find the otter,
or you quit.
That was the deal.
Badge.
- But, sir, we had...
- Badge!
Uh, no.
- What did you say, fox?
- Sorry, what I said was 'no...'.
She will not be giving you that badge.
Look, you gave her a clown vest,
and a three-wheeled joke-mobile,
and two days to solve a case
you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?
Yeah, it's no wonder she needed
to get help from a fox.
None of you guys were gonna help her,
were you?
Here's the thing, chief.
You gave her the 48 hours,
so technically we still have...
ten left to find our Mr. Otterton.
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.
So if you'll excuse us, we have a very
big lead to follow and a case to crack.
Good day.
Officer Hopps.
Thank you.
Never let them see that they get to you.
So...
Things do get to you?
I mean not, not anymore.
But I was small that's true.
But I was small that's true.
I think I was 8,
maybe 9...
And all I wanted to do was join
the Junior Ranger Scouts.
So my mom scaped together enough money
to buy me a brand new uniform.
Because, by god, I
was gonna fit in.
Even if I was the only predator
in the troop, the only fox.
I was gonna be part of a pack.
- Ready for initiation?
- Yeah. Pretty much born ready.
I was so proud.
Okay. Now raise your right
paw, and deliver the oath.
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave,
loyal, helpful and trustworthy.
Even though you're a fox?
What?
No, no! What did I
do wrong, you guys?
No, please! What did I do wrong?
What did I do?
If you thought we would ever
trust a fox without a muzzle?
You're even dumber than you look.
Is he gonna cry?
I learned two things that day.
One:
I was never gonna let anyone
see that they got to me.
And two?
If the world's only gonna see
a fox as shifty and untrustworthy...
There's no point in trying
to be anything else.
Nick, you are so much more than that.
Boy, look at that
traffic down there.
How about we go up to
Chuck in traffic central?
Chuck, how are things looking
on the jam cams?
Nick, I'm glad you told me.
The jam cams...
- Seriously, it's okay.
- No, no no!
There are traffic cameras everywhere.
All over the canopy!
- Whatever happened to that jaguar...
- The traffic cameras would have caught it!
- Bingo!
- Ho-ho! Pretty sneaky, slick!
However, if you didn't have
access to the system before,
I doubt chief Buffalo Butt is
gonna let you into it now.
No. But I have a friend
at City Hall who might.
Eh. Sir, if we could just review
these very important billings.
Sir! Oh, I'm sorry.
Sir.
Okay! I heard you, Bellwether,
just take care of it!
Please.
And clear my afternoon, I'm going out.
Oh, no, no. But, sir, you do
have a meeting with
Herds and Gradings.
Sir, that's just, oh...
Oh, mutton chops.
Assistant Mayor Bellwether,
we need your help.
We just need to get into
the traffic cam database.
- So fluffy!
- Hey!
- Sheep never let me get this close!
- You can't just touch a sheep's wool!
- It's like cotton candy.
- Stop it!
Where to?
Ah... Rainforest Dsitrict.
Vine and Tujunga.
There.
Traffic cams for the whole city.
This is so exiting actually.
I mean, well, you know.
I never get to do
anything this important.
But you're the assistant mayor of Zootopia.
Oh.
I'm more of a glorified secretary.
I think Mayor Lionheart just
wanted the sheep vote.
But he did give me that nice mug.
WORLD'S GREATES ASSISTANT MAYOR (Written with marker)
DAD (Crossed out)
Feels good to be appreciated.
Smellwether!
Ah.
That's a fun little name he likes to use.
I called him Lionfart once,
he did not care for that.
Let me tell you, it was
not a good day for me.
- Yes, sir.
- I thought you were gonna cancel my afternoon.
Oh, dear. I better go.
Let me know what you find.
It was really nice for me to be...
While we're young, Smellwether.
You think when she goes
to sleep she counts herself?
Shush.
Okay, traffic cams..
Tujunga.... Tujunga....
We're in.
- Who are these guys?
- Eh. Timberwolves.
Look at these dum-dums.
Huh!
Bet you a nickel one of them's gonna howl.
And there it is.
I mean, what is it with wolves
and the howling, it's...?
Howlings!
Night Howlers!
That's what Manchas was afraid of, wolves!
The wolves are the Night Howlers!
- If they took Manchas..
- I bet they took Otterton too.
All we gotta do is find out
where they went.
Wait, where'd they go?
You know, if I wanted to avoid surveillance
because I was doing something illegal,
which I never have, I would use the
maintenance tunnel 6B.
Which would put them out...
right there.
Well, look at you, junior detective.
You know, I think you'd actually
make a pretty good cop.
Eh. How dare you.
Ok, Shaly.
Focus on what we got.
South canyon.
Mm-hm.
They're heading out of town.
Where does that road go?
[ CLIFFSIDE ]
Gary, quit it!
You're gonna start a howl!
I didn't start it.
Come on.
You are a clever bunny.
It looks like this was a hospital.
You know, after you,
you're the cop.
Okay, all clear.
Ha.
All this equipment is brand new.
Carrots.
Claw marks.
Yeah, huge, huge claw marks.
What kind of...
Mr. Manchas.
It's him!
We found our otter.
Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer Judy Hopps.
Your wife sent me to find you.
We're gonna get you out of here now.
Or not.
Guess he's in no rush
to get home to the missus.
11, 12, 13, 14.
Not including Manchas,
it's... it's fourteen.
Chief Bogo handed out 14 missing mammal files.
They're all here...
All the missing mammals are right here.
Huh!
Enough!
I don't want excuses, doctor,
I want answers.
Mayor Lionheart, please.
We're doing everything we can.
Really?
Cause I got a dozen and a half animals here
who've gone off the rails crazy,
And you can't tell me why.
Now I'd call that awfully far
from doing everything!
Sir, it may be time to consider their biology.
What?
What do you mean 'biology'?
The only animals going savage are predators.
We cannot keep it a secret.
We need to come forward.
Hm, great idea.
Tell the public.
And how do you think they're gonna feel
about their mayor who is a lion?!
- I'll be ruined!
- Well, what does Chief Bogo say?
Chief Bogo doesn't know. And we
are going to keep it that way.
Oh, no!
- Someone's here.
- Sir, you need to go. Now.
Security, sweep the area.
Great, we're dead.
We're dead. That's it. I'm dead.
You're dead. Everybody's dead.
- Can you swim?
- What?
Can I swim?
Yes, I can swim. Why?
Aaahhhh!
Carrots!
Hopps! Judy!
We gotta tell Bogo!
Wow, you are one hot dancer, Chief Bogo.
- Chief Bogo!
- Not now.
- Wait, is that Gazelle?
- No!
I'm Gazelle, and you
are one hot dancer.
You have the app too?
Ooohhh... Chief!
Clawhauser! Can't you see I'm working
on the missing mammal cases?
Oh! Yes, of course.
About that, sir.
Officer Hopps just called,
she found all of them.
Wow, I'm impressed.
Mayor Lionheart, you have the right
to remain silent. Anything you...
You don't understand,
I was trying to protect the city!
You were just trying
to protect your job.
No, listen. We still don't
know why this is happening.
It could destroy Zootopia.
You have the right
to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.
Ladies and gentlemammals,
14 mammals went missing and
all 14 have been found...
by our newest recruit,
who will speak to you in a moment.
- I'm so nervous.
- Okay, press conference 101.
You wanna look smart, answer their question
with your own question
and then answer that question.
Like this: 'Excuse me, Officer Hopps.
What can you tell us about the case?'
'Well, was this a tough case?
Yes, yes it was.' You see?
You should be
up there with me.
We did this together.
Well, am I a cop?
No. No, I am not.
Funny you should say that.
Because, well, I've been thinking.
It would be nice to have a partner.
Here. In case you need
something to write with.
Officer Hopps.
It's time.
So now, I'll turn things over to the officer
who cracked the case.
Officer Judy Hopps.
Yes?
What can you tell us about
the animals that went savage?
Well, the animals in question...
Emm.
Are they all different species?
Yes. Yes, they are.
Okay, so what is the connection?
Oh. All we know is that they are all
members of the predator family.
So predators are the
only ones going savage?
That is accu..
Yes, that is accurate, yes.
- Why? Why is this happening?
- We still don't know.
But, emm.
It may have something to do with biology.
What do you mean, biology?
A biological component.
You know, something in their DNA.
In their DNA,
can you elaborate on that, please?
Yes. What I mean is
thousands of years ago
Eh, predators survived through their...
agressive hunting instincts.
For whatever reason, they seem to be
reverting back to their primitive, savage ways.
Officer Hopps, could
it happen again?
It is possible.
So, we must be vigilant.
And we at the ZPD are prepered
and are here to protect you.
How would ZPD protect us?
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.
That's all the time that we have.
No more questions.
- Was I okay?
- Oh, you did fine.
That went so fast, I
didn't get a chance to
mention you or say anything
about how we...
Oh, I think you said plenty.
What do you mean?
'Clearly there's a
biological component'?
'These predators may be reverting back
to their primitive, savage ways'?
Are you serious?
I just stated the
facts of the case.
I mean, it's not like a
bunny could go savage.
Right, but a fox could? Huh?
- Nick, stop it, you're not like them.
- Oh, there's a 'them' now?
You know what I mean,
you're not that kind of predator.
The kind that needs
to be muzzled?
The kind that makes you think you need
to carry around fox repellant?
Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that
little item the first time we met.
Look. Let me ask you a question.
Are you afraid of me?
Do you think I might go nuts?
You think I might go savage?
You think I might try to eat you?
Huh!
I knew it, huh.
Just when I thought somebody
actually believed in me, huh?
Probably best if you don't have
a predator as a partner.
No, Nick.
Nick!
Officer Hopps, were you just
threatened by that predator?
No, he's my friend.
We can't even trust our own friends?
That is not what I said.
Please.
- Are we safe?
- Have any other foxes gone savage?
More bad news in this city gripped by fear.
A caribou is in critical condition.
The victim of a mauling by
a savage polar bear.
This, the 27th such attack,
comes just one week after ZPD Officer,
Judy Hopps connected the violence
to traditionally predatory animals.
Meanwhile, a peace rally organized by
popstar Gazelle was marred by protest.
- Go back to the forest, predator!
- I am from the savannah.
Zootopia is a unique place.
It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city.
Where we celebrate our differences.
This is not the Zootopia I know.
The Zootopia I know
is better than this.
We don't just blindly assign blame.
We don't know why these
attacks keep happening.
But it's irresponsible to label all
predators as savages.
It's not my Emmitt.
We cannot let fear divide us.
Please give me back the Zootopia I love.
Come on, Hopps.
The new mayor wants to see us.
The mayor?
Why?
It would seem you've arrived.
Clawhauser?
What are you doing?
Uh. They thought it would be
better if a predator
such as myself wasn't the first face
that you see
when you walk into the ZPD.
What?
They're gonna move me to records.
It's downstairs.
It's by the boiler.
Hopps1
Integrity
Honesty
Valor
Emm.
I don't understand.
Our city is 90% prey, Judy,
and right now
they're just really scared.
You're a hero to them.
They trust you.
And so that's why Chief Bogo and I
want you to be the public face of the ZPD.
I'm... not...
I'm not a hero.
I came here to make the world
a better place. But...
... I think I broke it.
Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps.
The world has always been broken,
that's why we need good cops.
Like you.
With all due respect, sir,
a good cop is supposed to serve and protect.
Help the city.
Not tear it apart.
- I don't deserve this badge.
- Hopps.
Judy, you've worked so hard
to get here.
It's what you've wanted since
you were a kid.
You can't quit.
Thank you for the opportunity.
A dozen carrots.
Have a nice day.
Come on.
Hey there, Jude.
Jude the Dude.
Remember that one?
How we doing?
- I'm fine.
- You are not fine, your ears are droopy.
Why did I think I could
make a difference?
- Because you're a trier, that's why.
- You've always been a trier.
Oh, I tried.
And it made life so much worse
for so many innocent predators.
Oh, not all of them, though.
Speak of the devil. Right on time.
Is that Gideon Grey?
Yeah, it sure is.
We work with him now.
He's our partner. And we never
would have considered it,
- had you not opened our minds.
- That's right.
I mean, kid's turned into one of the
top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.
That's...
That's really cool, you guys.
Gideon Grey. I'll be darned.
Hey, Judy. I'd just like to say I'm sorry
for the way I behaved in my youth.
I had a lot of self-doubt,
and it manifested itself
in the form of unchecked
rage and agression.
I was a major jerk.
Well, I know a thing or two
about being a jerk.
Anyhow, I brought you all these pies.
Hey, kids! Don't you run through that
Midnicampum holicithias.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Well, now. There's a
four-dollar word, Mr. H.
My family always just
call them Night Howlers.
I'm sorry.
What did you say?
Oh.
Kid's talking about those flowers, Judy.
I use them to keep the bugs off the produce,
but I don't like the little ones going near them
on acoount of what happened
to your uncle Terry.
Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we were kids
and went completely nuts.
He bit the dickens out of your mother.
A bunny can go savage.
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.
But it did hurt like the devil.
Well, sure it did. There's a sizable
divot in your arm. I'd call that savage.
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're flowers.
The flowers are making the predators go savage.
That's it! That's what
I've been missing!
Oh, keys! Keys! Keys! Keys!
Hurry, come on!
Oh. Thank you!
I love you, bye!
- You catch any of that, Bon?
- Not one bit.
That makes me feel a little bit better,
I thought she was talking in
tongues or something.
Who is it?
I need to find Nick.
Please.
Nick?
Nick?
Oh, Nick.
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're toxic flowers.
I think someone is targetting predators
on purpose and making them go savage.
Wow.
Isn't that interesting?
Wait, please don't..
I know you'll never forgive me.
And I don't blame you.
I wouldn't forgive me either.
It was ignorant, and irresponsible,
and small-minded.
But predators shouldn't suffer
because of my mistakes.
I have to fix this.
But I can't do it without you.
And...
And after we're done...
you can hate me.
And...
And that'll be fine.
Because I was a horrible
friend and I hurt you.
And you can walk away knowing
that you were right. All along.
I really am just a dumb bunny.
'I really am just a dumb bunny.'
'I really am just a dumb bunny.'
Don't worry, Carrots,
I'll let you erase it. In 48 hours.
All right, get in here.
Okay. Oh, you bunnies.
You're so emotional.
There we go, deep breath.
Are you-Are you just
trying to steal the pen?
Is that what this is?
- You are standing on my tail, though. Off, off!
- I'm sorry.
HOPPS
FAMILY FARM
I thought you guys only grew carrots.
Mmph.
- What's your plan?
- We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.
Okay, how?
- Know this guy?
- Uh-huh. I told you, I know everybody.
Ha-ha. Well, hello!
Step right up.
Anything you need, I got it.
All your favorite movies.
I've got movies that
haven't even been released yet.
Hey, 15% off.
20!
Make me an offer.
Come on!
Well, well, look who it is,
the Duke of Bootleg.
What's it to you, Wilde?
Shouldn't you be melting down
a pawpsicle or something?
Hey, if it isn't
flopsy the copsie.
We both know those weren't only
onions I caught you stealing.
What were you gonna do with
those Night Howlers, Weselton?
It's Weaselton, Duke Weaselton.
And I ain't talking, rabbit.
And there ain't nothing
you can do to make me.
Ice him.
Ahhh!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ah!
You dirty rat, why are you helping her?
She's a cop!
And the godmother to
my future granddaughter.
- I'm gonna name her Judy.
- Ohhhh...
Heh heh heh.
Ice this weasel.
Aww! All right, all right!
Please! I'll talk. I'll talk.
I stole the Night Howlers
so I could sell them.
They offered me what I
couldn't refuse: Money.
And to whom did you sell them?
A ram named Doug. We got
a drop spot underground.
Just watch it.
Doug is the opposite of friendly.
He's unfriendly.
Come on.
The weasel wasn't lying.
Yeah, it looks like old Doug's cornered
the market on Night Howlers.
You got Doug here.
What's the mark?
Cheetah in Sahara Square.
Got it.
Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast,
I can hit him.
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter
through the open window of a moving car.
Yeah, I'll buzz you when it's done.
Or you'll see it on the news.
You know, whichever comes first.
Hey, Doug, open up!
We've got your latte.
All right, Woolter and Jesse are back,
so I'm leaving now. Out.
Hey. Wait, where you going?
Where are you going? Get back here!
What are you doing?
He's gonna see you!
What are you looking at?
Hey!
Whatever you're thinking,
stop thinking it.
Carrots.
Carrots.
You better have the
extra foam this time.
HA!
Hey!
Open up!
What are you doing? You
just trapped us in here!
We need to get this
evidence to the ZPD.
- Okay, great. Here it is. Got it.
- No, all of it.
Wait, what?
Oh, great, you're a
conductor now, huh?
Hey. Listen. It would take a miracle
to get this rustbucket going.
Well.
Hallelujah.
We kinda got a situation at the lab.
It just got worse!
Mission accomplished.
Would it be premature for me to
do a little victory toot-toot?
All right.
One toot-toot.
Well, I can cross that off
the bucket list.
I may have to rescind
that victory toot-toot.
Maybe that's just hail.
Back off!
Incoming!
- Carrots!
- Don't stop! Keep going.
No, stop.
Please stop!
Do not stop this car!
Ahhh!
Owww!
Whoa!
- Speed up, Nick. Speed up!
- There's another train coming!
Trust me, speed up.
Stop the train!
Hey.
Need some help?
Oh, no. Oh, no no no.
Too fast! Too fast! Hold on!
I think this is our stop.
Okay, maybe...
Maybe some of the evidence survived.
Everything is gone.
We've lost it all.
Yeah. All, except for this.
Ah, ha ha ha ha!
- Ooh, Nick! Yes!
- Ow.
Come on!
We gotta get to the ZPD.
Cut through the Natural History Museum.
- There it is.
- Judy. Judy!
Mayor Bellwether.
We found out what's happening.
Someone's darting predators with a serum.
That's what's making them go savage.
I'm so proud of you, Judy.
You did just a super job.
Thank you, ma'am.
How did you know
where to find us?
I'll go ahead and
I'll take that case now.
You know what? I think Nick and I
will just take this to the ZPD.
- Run.
- Run.
Get them!
Ah....
Carrots!
Aww.
Here, I got you.
Get in here.
Okay.
Now, just relax.
Whoops.
- Blueberry?
- Pass.
Come on out, Judy.
Take the case.
Get it to Bogo.
I'm not gonna leave you behind,
that's not happening.
- I can't walk.
- Just.. We'll think of something.
We're on the same team, Judy.
Underestimated.
Underappreciated.
Aren't you sick of it?
Predators.
They may be strong and loud.
But prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.
Think about it. 90% of the population
united against a common enemy.
We'll be unstoppable.
Huh?
Over there!
Oh!
Ah!
Well, you should have just
stayed on the carrot farm, huh?
It really is too bad,
I did like you.
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?
Oohhh.
No, of course not.
He is.
No!
Oh, Nick?
Yes, police! There's a savage fox in the
Natural History Museum!
Officer Hopps is down.
Please hurry!
No, Nick.
Don't do this. Fight it.
Oh, but he can't help it.
Can he?
Since predators are just biologically
predisposed to be savages.
Get back!
Gosh!
Think of the headline!
'Hero Cop Killed by Savage Fox.'
So that's it? Prey fears predator,
and you stay in power?
Yeah.
Pretty much.
It won't work.
Fear always works.
And I'll dart every predator in
Zootopia to keep it that way.
Ah!
Oh, Nick.
No.
Bye-bye, bunny.
Blahhh...
Blood, blood, blood!
And death.
All right, you know you're milking it.
Besides, I think we got it.
I think we got it.
We got it up there,
thank you, yakety-yak.
You laid it all out beautifully.
What?
Yeah. Oh, are-are you looking for the serum?
Well, it's right here.
What you've got
in the weapon there,
those are blueberries,
from my family's farm.
Mmmuch. They are delicious.
You should try some.
I framed Lionheart,
I can frame you too.
It's my word against yours.
Ooo.
Actually...
'And I'll dart every predator
in Zootopia to keep it that way.'
- It's your word against yours.
- Huh?
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart.
Boom!
Former mayor, Dawn Bellwether
is behind bars today,
guilty of masterminding the savage attacks
that have plagued Zootopia of late.
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart,
denies any knowledge of her plot,
claiming he was just trying
to protect the city.
Did I falsely imprison those animals?
Well, yes.
Yes, I did.
It was a classic doing the wrong thing
for the right reason kind of a deal.
In related news, doctors say the Night Howlers'
antidote is proving effective
in rehabilitating the afflicted predators.
Oh, Emmitt!
Thank you.
When I was a kid,
I thought Zootopia was this perfect place.
Where everyone got along,
and anyone could be anything.
Turns out, real life is a little bit more
complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker.
Real life is messy.
We all have limitations.
We all make mistakes.
Which means, hey, glass half full,
we all have a lot in common.
And the more we try to
understand one another.
The more exceptional each of us will be.
But we have to try.
So no matter what type
of animal you are.
From the biggest elephant,
to our first fox.
I implore you.
Try.....
Try to make the world a better place.
OFFICER
Nicholas P. Wilde
Look inside yourself and recognize
that change starts with you.
It starts with me.
It starts with all of us.
- Yeh!
- Yeh!
All right, all right, enough.
Shut it!
We have some new recruits
with us this morning.
Including our first fox.
Who cares.
Hah. You should have your own line
of inspirational greeting cards, sir.
Shut your mouth, Wilde.
Assignments.
Officers Grizzoli, Fragmire, Delgato.
Tundratown SWAT.
Snarlof, Higgins, Wolfard.
Undercover.
Hopps, Wilde.
Parking duty.
Dismissed.
Just kidding!
We have reports of a street racer
tearing up Savannah Central.
Find him.
Shut him down.
So are all the rabbits bad drivers,
or is it just you?
Oops.
Sorry.
Heh heh.
Sly bunny.
Dumb fox.
You know you love me.
Do I know that?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour,
I hope you have a good explanation.
Flash, Flash.
Hundred Yard Dash!
Nick...
Good evening, Zootopia!
Come on, everybody.
Put your paws up.
I messed up tonight,
I lost another fight
I still mess up but I'll just start again
I keep falling down
I keep on hitting the ground
I always get up now to see what's next
I wont give up,
no I wont give in
Till I reach the end
And then Ill start again
Though Im on the lead
I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
I wont give up,
no I wont give in
Till I reach the end
And then Ill start again
No I won't leave
I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
Oh oh oh oh
Try everything
Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.
'Cause of something that happened
before I was even born.
See, a long time ago,
there was this family.
The Pap, he was a musician.
He and his family
would sing and dance
and count their blessings.
But he also had a dream.
To play for the world.
And one day...
he left with his guitar...
and never returned.
And my Mam...
She didn't have time to cry
over that walk-away musician.
After banishing all music
from her life...
she found a way
to provide for her daughter.
She rolled up her sleeves...
and she learned to make shoes.
She could have made candy.
O-o-or fireworks.
Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers.
But no.
She chose shoes.
Then she taught
her daughter to make shoes.
And later, she taught
her son-in-law.
Then her grandkids got roped in.
As her family grew,
so did the business.
Music have torn
her family apart.
But shoes held
them all together.
You see that woman...
was my great-great-grandmother...
Mam Imelda.
She died way before I was born.
But my family still
tells her story...
every year on Da de los Muertos
-- the Day of the Dead...
And her little girl?
She's my great-grandmother, Mam Coco.
Hola, Mam Coco.
How are you, Julio?
Actually, my name is Miguel.
Mam Coco has trouble
remembering things.
But it's good to talk to her,
anyway.
So, I tell her
pretty much everything.
I used to run like this.
But now I run like this,
it's just way faster.
The winner is...
luchadora Coco!
I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.
Miguel, eat your food.
My abuelita, she's
Mam Coco's daughter.
Aw, you're a twig, mijo.
Have some more.
No, gracias.
I asked if you would like
more tamales.
S-Si?
That's what I thought you said!
Abuelita runs the house
just as Mam Imelda did.
No music!
No music!
Aunque la vida...
No music!
I think we're the only family
in Mexico who hates music.
And my family's fine with that.
But me...
Be back by lunch, mijo.
Love you, Mam!
I'm not like the rest
of my family.
- Hola, Miguel.
- Hola.
- Muchas gracias!
- De nada, Miguel!
He-hey, Dante!
Sit.
Down.
Roll over.
Shake.
Fist bump.
Good boy, Dante!
I know, I'm not supposed
to love music.
But it's not my fault.
It's his.
Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician
of all time.
Here in this very plaza,
the young Ernesto de la Cruz
took his first steps
toward becoming
the most beloved singer
in Mexican history.
He started out a total nobody
from Santa Cecilia, like me.
But when he played music,
he made people
fall in love with him.
He starred in movies.
He had the coolest guitar.
He could fly!
And he wrote the best songs.
But my all-time favorite is...
Remember me
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me
Don't let it make you cry
For even if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you
Each night we are apart
Remember me
Though I have to travel far
Remember me
Each time you hear a sad guitar
Know that I'm with you the only way that I can be...
Until you're in my arms again
He lived the kind of life you dream about...
Remember me
Until 1942.
When he was crushed
by a giant bell.
I wanna be just like him.
Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz...
and I get this feeling.
Like we're connected somehow.
Like if he could play music...
maybe someday, I could too!
If it wasn't for my family.
Ay, ay, ay, muchacho!
Huh?
I asked for a shoe shine,
not your life story.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I just can't really talk about
any of this at home, so.
Look, if I were you,
I'd march right up
to my family and say,
"Hey, I'm a musician.
Deal with it!"
I could never say that.
You are a musician, no?
I could never say that.
You are a musician, no?
I-I-I don't know.
I mean, I only really
play for myself.
Ah! Did de la Cruz become
the world's best musician
by hiding his sweet,
sweet skills?
No!
He walked out onto that plaza
and he played out loud!
Mira, Mira, they're
setting up for tonight.
The music competition for
Da de Muertos.
You wanna be like your hero?
You should sign up!
Unh-unh. My family would freak!
Look, if you're too scared,
then, well, have fun making shoes.
Come on, what did
de la Cruz always say?
Seize your moment?
Show me what you got,
muchacho.
I'll be your first audience.
Miguel!
Ah!
Abuelita!
What are you doing here?
Um... oh... uh...
You leave my grandson alone!
Doa, please! I was just
getting a shine.
I know your tricks, mariachi.
What did he say to you?
He was just showing me
his guitar.
Shame on you!
My grandson is a
is a sweet little
angelito, perrito, cielito!
He wants no part
of your music, mariachi.
You keep away from him.
Ay, pobrecito!
Estas bien, mijo.
You know better than
to be here in this place.
You will come home.
Now.
How many times
have we told you?
That plaza is crawling
with mariachis.
Yes, To Berto.
No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, go away, you. Go!
It's just Dante.
Never name a street dog.
They'll follow you forever.
Now, go get my shoe.
I found your son in
Mariachi Plaza.
Ay, Miguel?
You know how abuelita
feels about the plaza.
I was just shining shoes.
A musician's shoes.
But the plaza's where
the foot traffic is.
If abuelita says, "No more plaza",
then no more plaza.
But what about tonight?
What's tonight?
Well, they're having
this talent show.
- A-and I thought I might...
- Sign up?
Well, maybe?
You have to have talent
to be in a talent show.
What are you gonna do?
Shine shoes? Oh!
It's Da de los Muertos.
No one's going any where.
Tonight is about family.
Ofrenda room. Vmonos.
Don't give me that look.
Da de los Muertos is the
one night of the year
our ancestors can come visit us.
We put their photos
on the ofrenda
so their spririts can cross over.
That is very important.
If we don't put them up,
they can't come.
We made all this food.
Set out the things
they loved in life, mijo.
All this work to
bring the family together.
I don't want you sneaking off
to who-knows-where.
Huh! Where are you going?
- I thought we were done.
- Ay, Dios mo.
Being part of this family means
being here for this family.
I don't want to see you
end up like...
Like Mam Coco's pap?
Never mention that man!
He's better off forgotten.
- But you're the one who...
- Eh, thchhsss!
- I was just...
- Tchsshh!
- But...
- Tchshh.
- I...
- Shhh.
Pap?
Pap is home?
Mam, clmese, clmese.
Pap is coming home?
No, Mam, it's okay.
I'm here.
Who are you?
Ay... rest, Mam.
I'm hard on you
because I care, Miguel.
Miguel?
Miguel?
Ay.
What are we going to do
with that boy?
Ha ha ha, you're right.
That's just what he needs.
Huah!
Oh, it's you. Get in here.
Come on, Dante. Hurry up.
You're gonna get me
in trouble, boy.
Someone can hear me.
I wish someone
wanted to hear me.
Other than you.
Ew, okay!
Perfecto.
I have to sing.
I have to play.
The music, it's...
it's not just in me.
It is me.
When life gets me down.
I play my guitar.
The rest of the world may
follow the rules, but I...
must follow my heart.
Ugh.
You know that feeling...
like there's a song in the air
and it's playing just for you?
A feeling so close
You could reach out
and touch it
I never knew
I could want something
so much
But it's true
You must have faith, sister.
Oh, but Padre,
he will never listen.
He will listen to music!
Only a song, only a song
Has the power
to change a heart
Never underestimate
the power of music.
But my father,
he will never give
his permission.
I am done
asking permission.
When you see your moment,
you mustn't let it pass you by.
You must seize it.
Seor de la Cruz,
what did it take for you
to seize your moment?
I had to have faith
in my dream.
No one was going to hand it to me.
It was up to me to
reach for that dream.
Grab it tight...
and make it come true.
No more hiding, Dante.
I gotta seize my moment.
I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza
if it kills me.
Da de Muertos has begun!
No, no, no, no, no.
We have to make a clear path.
The petals guide
our ancestors home.
- Mam!
- Hunh!
Where should we put this table?
In the courtyard, mijos.
You want it down
by the kitchen?
Si, eh, next to the other one.
Get under, get under!
Miguel?
Uh, nothing.
Mam, Pap, I...
Miguel, your abuelita have
the most wonderful idea.
We've all decided...
it's time you joined us
in the workshop!
What?
No more shining shoes.
You will be making them,
every day, after school.
Oh, our Miguelitititito
carrying on the family tradition.
And on Da de los Muertos!
Your ancestors
would be so proud.
You'll craft huaraches
just like your Ta Victoria.
And wing tips just like
your Pap Julio.
But what if I'm no good
at making shoes?
Ay, Miguel.
You have your family here
to guide you.
You are a Rivera.
And a Rivera is?
A shoemaker...
through and through.
That's my boy!
Haha! Berto!
Break out the good stuff!
Mm, mm, mm, mwah!
Dante!
No, Dante, stop!
Hunh!
Ah!
No, no, no, no, no!
No.
De la Cruz' guitar?
Ah?
Pap?
Mam Coco.
Is your pap Ernesto de la Cruz?
Pap! Pap!
Haha!
Pap, Pap!
It's him!
I know who my
great-great-grandfather was!
Miguel, get down from there.
Mam Coco's father
was Ernesto de la Cruz!
What are you talking about?
I'm gonna be a musician!
What is all this?
You keep secrets
from your own family?
It's all that time he spends
in the plaza.
Fills his head
with crazy fantasies.
It's not a fantasy.
That man was
Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician
of all time.
We've never known
anything about this man.
Or whoever he was,
he still abandoned his family.
It's no future for my son.
Well, Pap, y-you said
my family would guide me.
Well, de la Cruz is my family.
I'm supposed to play music.
Never! That man's music
was a curse.
I will not allow it.
- If you would just...
- Miguel.
You will listen to your family.
No more music.
Just listen to me play.
End of argument.
You want to end up
like that man?
Forgotten?
Left off your family's ofrenda?
I don't care if I'm on some
stupid ofrenda.
- Hunh!
- Hunh!
- No!
- Mam!
There.
No guitar.
No music.
Aw, come.
You'll feel better after
you eat with your family.
I don't wanna be in this family!
Miguel, Miguel!
I-I wanna play in the plaza.
Like de la Cruz.
C-can I still sign up?
You got an instrument?
No. But if I can borrow a guitar.
Musicians gotta bring
their own instruments.
You find a guitar, kid,
I'll put you on the list.
Hey, excuse me,
can I borrow your guitar?
Sorry, muchaco.
You guys have a spare guitar?
No.
I need a guitar
just for a little bit.
Get outta here, kid.
Great-great-grandfather.
What am I supposed to do?
No, no, no, no.
Dante, stop.
Cllate, shh.
I'm sorry.
Seor de la Cruz.
Please don't be mad.
I-I'm Miguel.
Your great-great-grandson.
I-I need to borrow this.
Our family thinks
music is a curse.
None of them understand.
But I know you would have.
You would have told me
to follow my heart.
To seize my moment.
So, if it's all right with you...
I'm gonna play in the Plaza.
Just like you did!
Huh?
What's going on?
Somebody stole
de la Cruz' guitar.
The window is broken, look!
All right, who's in there?
I'm sorry, i-it's not
what it looks like.
De la Cruz is my...
Huh!
There's nobody here!
- Miguel!
- Mam!
Miguel, come home!
Dios mio, little boy!
Are you okay?
Here, let me help you.
Thanks. I...
- Aaah!
- Aaah!
Aah!
Aah!
Do you mind?
- Aah!
- Aah!
Look how big she's getting.
Uh! Dante?
You can see me?
Wait! What's going on?
Dante! Dante!
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Miguel?
- Miguel?
- Miguel?
Y-you're here!
Here here.
And you can see us?
Our Miguelitititito!
Remind me how I know you?
We're your family, mijo.
Ta Rosita?
Si.
Pap Julio?
Hola!
Ta Vic...toria?
He doesn't seem
entirely dead.
He's not quite alive, either.
We need Mam Imelda.
She'll know how to fix this.
Oye!
It's Mam Imelda!
She couldn't cross over!
She's stuck!
On the other side!
To Oscar?
To Felipe?
Oh, hey, Miguel.
I have a feeling this has
something to do with you.
But if Mam Imelda
can't come to us...
Then we are going to her!
- Whoa!
- Vmonos!
Whoa.
Come on, Miguel, it's-it's okay.
Dante?
Dante!
Dante, wait up!
You've gotta stay with me, boy.
You don't know...
where...
This isn't a dream, then.
You're all really out there.
You thought we weren't?
Oh, I don't know.
I thought it might have been
one of those made-up things...
that adults tell kids, like...
vitamins.
Miguel, vitamins
are a real thing.
Well, now I'm thinking
maybe they could be.
Hunh!
Mija, it's not nice to stare at...
Ay, Santa Ma...
Are those?
Alebrijes!
- But those are...
- Real alebrijes.
Spirit creatures.
They guide souls
on their journey.
Watch your step,
they make cacitas everywhere.
Welcome back
to the Land of the Dead.
Please have all offerings
ready for re-entry.
Welcome back.
Anything to declare?
Some churros, from my family.
How wonderful!
If you're experiencing
travel issues...
Agents at the Department of
Family Reunion
are available to assist you.
Next family, please.
Oh, your photos are
in your son's ofrenda.
Have a great visit.
- Gracias.
- Gracias.
And remember to return
before sunrise.
Enjoy your visit!
Next?
Your photo's on your
dentist's ofrenda.
Enjoy your visit.
Grashiash.
Next?
Yes, it is I, Frida Kahlo.
Shall we skip the scanner?
I'm on so many ofrendas
it will just overwhelm your
blinky thingy.
Whoa, shoot.
Looks like no one
put up your photo...
Frida?
Okay, when I said
I was Frida, just now...
That.
That was a lie.
And I apologize for doing that.
No photo on an ofrenda,
no crossing the bridge.
You know what?
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.
Haha!
Almost... there...
Just a little... further...
Ugh.
Upsy daisy.
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?
Dumb flower bridge!
Aw, I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.
Next?
Oh, come mijo, it's our turn.
Welcome back, amigo.
Anything to declare?
A-as a matter of fact...
Yes.
Hola.
Paging Marta Gonzalez Ramos...
Marta Gonzalez Ramos...
Please report to level seven.
Whoa.
I miss my nose.
Come on, help us out, amigo.
We gotta get to a
dozen ofrendas tonight.
We are not visiting
your ex-wife, Stanley,
por Da de Muertos.
I demand to speak to the
person in charge.
I'm sorry, seora, it says here
no one put up your photo.
My family always, always
put my photo up in the ofrenda
That devil box tells you
nothing but lies.
Mam Imelda?
Oh, mi familia.
They wouldn't let me
cross the bridge.
Tell this woman and her
devil box
that my photo is in the ofrenda.
Well, w-we never
made it to the ofrenda.
What?
We ran into a...
um...
Hunh! Miguel?
Mam Imelda.
What is going on?
You the Rivera family?
Well, you're cursed.
What?
Da de los Muertos
is a night to give to the dead.
You stole from the dead.
But I wasn't sealing the guitar.
Guitar?
It was my
great-great-grandfather's.
He would have
wanted me to have it.
Ah-ah-ah! We do not speak
of that musician.
He is dead to this family.
Uh, you're all dead.
Achoo!
I am sorry, uh,
who's alebrije is that?
That's Dante.
He sure doesn't look
like an alebrije.
He just looks like
a plain old dog.
Or a sausage someone
dropped in a barbershop.
Whatever he is, I am-
achoo!
terribly allergic.
But Dante doesn't have any hair.
And I don't have a nose
and yet here we are.
Achoo!
But none of this explains
why I couldn't cross over.
Oh...
You took my photo
off the ofrenda?
It was an accident.
How do we send him back?
Well, since it's a family matter...
The way to undo a family curse is
to get your family's blessing.
That's it?
Get your family's blessing
and everything should
go back to normal.
But you've gotta do it by sunrise.
What happens at sunrise?
Hjole, your hand!
Huh!
Whoa, Miguel.
Can't have you fainting on us.
But not to worry.
Your family is here.
You can get your
blessing right now.
Cempasuchil, cempasuchil.
Aha!
Perdn, seora.
Oh.
Now, you look at the living
and say his name.
Miguel.
Nailed it.
Now say,
"I give you my blessing."
I give you my blessing.
I give you my blessing
to go home...
To put my photo back
on the ofrenda...
And to never play music again.
What? She can't do that!
Well, technically, she can add
any condition she wants.
Fine.
Then you
hand the petal to Miguel.
Ha!
No skeletons.
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.
Two seconds and you
already break your promise.
This isn't fair, it's my life.
You already had yours.
Pap Julio,
I ask for your blessing.
Ta Rosita?
Oscar?
Felipe?
Ta Victoria?
Don't make this hard, mijo.
You go home my way,
or no way.
You really hate music
that much?
I will not let you go down
the same path he did.
The same path he did.
He's family.
Listen to your Mam Imelda.
She's just looking out for you.
Be reasonable.
Con permiso,
I need to visit the rest room.
Be right back.
Ah, should we tell him
there are no restrooms
in the Land of the Dead?
Vmonos.
We got a family looking
for a living boy.
I wanna be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.
We gotta find my
great-great-grandpa.
Hold it, muchaco.
Huh!
I found that little boy!
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me, folks.
Excuse me.
Oh.
Dante.
Disturbing the peace.
Fleeing an officer.
Falsifying a unibrow.
That's illegal?
Very illegal.
You need to clean up
your act, amigo.
Amigo?
Oh, that's-that's so nice
to hear you say that because
I have just had a really
hard Da de Muertos
and I could really use
an amigo right now.
And amigos, they help
their amigos.
Listen, you get me across
that bridge tonight...
and I'll make it
worth your while.
You like de la Cruz?
He and I go way back.
I can get you front row seats
to his sunrise spectacular show.
I-I'll get you backstage.
You can meet him.
You just gotta let me
cross that bridge.
I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.
But my shift's almost up and...
I wanna visit my living family.
So I'm letting you off
with a warning.
Can I at least
get my costume back?
Uh... no.
Ser maldito.
Hey.
Hey!
You really know de la Cruz?
Who wants to... ah! Ay!
You're alive!
Yeah, I'm alive.
And I want to get back to
the Land of the Living...
I need de la Cruz' blessing.
That's weirdly specific.
He's my great-great-grandfather.
He's your gr-gr-gr-
what?
Ew.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.
Hunh!
Wait. No. Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, uh, wait,
Wait, uh, wait, wait,
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait,
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!
You know what? Maybe this
isn't such a good...
Nio, nio, I can help you.
You can help me.
We can help each other.
But most importantly,
you can help me.
- Miguel!
- Huh!
- I'm Hctor.
- That's nice.
Esperame, chamaco!
Ay! He is going
to get himself killed!
I need my spirit guide...
Pepita.
Who has that petal
Miguel touched?
Here... n-nice alebrije.
Hey, hey, hold still.
Look up, look up.
A ver, a ver.
Look up, up, up!
Okay.
Eh. Ta-da!
Dead as a doorknob.
So listen, Miguel.
This place runs on memories.
When you're well remembered,
people put up your photo...
and you get to cross the bridge
and visit the living on
Da de Muertos.
Unless you're me.
You don't get to cross over?
No one's ever put up my picture.
But you can change that!
This is you?
Eh, Muy guapo, eh?
So, you get me to my
great-great-grandpa...
Then I put up your photo
when I get home?
Such a smart boy!
Yes! Great idea, yes!
One hiccup, de la Cruz
is a tough guy to get to...
and I need to cross that
bridge soon. Like tonight.
So, you got any other
family here, you know?
Someone a bit more, eh,
accessible?
Um... nope.
Don't yank my chain, chamaco.
You gotta have
some other family.
Only de la Cruz.
If you can't help me,
I'll find him myself.
Ugh. Okay, okay, kid.
Fine, fine.
I'll get you to your
great-great-grandpa.
It's not gonna be easy,
you know.
You know, he's a-
he's a busy man.
Wait, what are you doing?
I'm walking like a skeleton.
Blending in.
No. Skeletons don't
walk like that.
It's how you walk.
No, I don't.
Stop it!
Whoa!
Ernesto de la Cruz'
Sunrise Spectacular?
Que padre?
Wuacch, every year,
your great-great-grandpa
puts on that dumb show
to mark the end of Da de Muertos.
A-a-and you can get us in!
I'm...
Hey, you said you had
front-row tickets!
That...
that was a lie.
I apologize for that.
Cool off, chamaco, come on.
I'll get you to him.
How?
'Cause I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.
Ugh.
You better have
my dress, Hctor.
Hola, Ceci!
Ay!
Hola.
Cezi!
I lost the dress.
Ay, diosa Mia!
I've got to dress 40 dancers
by sunrise.
- And thanks to you...
- Cezi, Cezi...
- I'm one Frida short
- Cezi...
of an opening number.
- Dante.
Dante!
We shouldn't be in here.
Dante! Ven ac!
You!
How did you get in here?
I-I just followed my...
Hunh! Oh, the mighty Xolo dog!
Guider of wandering spirits.
And whose spirit
have you guided to me?
I don't think he's a spirit guide.
Uh-uh-uh! The alebrijes of this
world can take many forms.
They are as mysterious
as they are powerful.
Or maybe he's just a dog.
Come! I need your eyes.
Your are the audience.
Darkness!
And from the darkness...
A giant papaya!
Dancers emerge from the papaya.
And the dancers...
Are all me!
And they go to drink
from the milk of their mother.
Who is a cactus.
But who is also me!
And her milk is not milk...
but tears.
Is it too obvious?
I think it's just the
right amount of obvious.
It could use some music.
Oh, what if you did like...
Tun-tun-tun-tun-tun?
Oh, and then it could go...
Darala-dalala-dalala-dalala
Whenk?
And what if everything was on fire?
Yes! Fire everywhere!
Inspired.
You. You have
the spirit of an artist.
The dancers exit. The music fades.
The lights go out.
And Ernesto de la Cruz
rises to the stage.
Huh?
He does a couple of songs.
The sun rises. Everyone cheers.
Excuse me, where's
the real de la Cruz?
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals.
He's too busy hosting that
fancy party at the top of his tower.
Chamaco, you can't
run off on me like that.
Come on, stop pestering
the celebrities.
You said my great-great-grandpa
would be here.
He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.
That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?
If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?
He's your great-great-grandpa.
How come he didn't invite you?
Hey, Gustavo! You know
anything about this party?
Sh-it's the hot ticket!
But if you're not on the guest list,
you're never gettin' in,
Chorizo.
Hey, it's Chorizo!
Ah-ha, very funny, guys.
Very funny.
Chorizo?
Oh, this guy's famous.
Go on, go on.
Ask him how he died.
I-I don't wanna talk about it.
He choked on some chorizo!
I didn't choke, okay?
I got food poisoning
which is a big difference.
This is why I don't like musicians.
Bunch of self-important jerks!
Hey, I'm a musician.
- You are?
- Well...
If you really wanna get to Ernesto...
there is that music competition
at the Plaza de la Cruz.
Winner gets to play at his party.
No, no, no, Chamaco!
You are loco if you think...
I need to get my great-great-
grandfather's blessing.
You know where
I can get a guitar?
Ay... I know a guy.
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?
A footprint!
It's a Rivera boot.
- Size seven!
- And a half.
- Pronated.
- Miguel.
Why the heck would you
wanna be a musician?
My great-great-grandfather's
a musician.
Who spent his life performing like
a monkey for complete strangers?
Blech! No, no, thank you, no.
What do you know?
So, how far is this guitar, anyway?
We're almost there.
Keep up, chamaco, come on!
Cousin Hctor!
Hey! These guys!
Hctor!
Hey, to, qu onda?
These people are all you family?
Eh... yeah, in a way.
We're all the ones with
no photos or ofrendas.
No family to go home to.
Nearly forgotten, you know?
So we all call each other
"cousin" or "to" or-or whatever.
- Hctor!
- Ta Chelos! Hey!
Muchas gracias.
Save some for me.
Is Chicharrn around?
In the bungalow. I don't know if
he's in the mood for visitors.
Ah, who doesn't like a
visit from cousin Hctor?
Huh!
Buenas noches, Chicharrn.
I don't want to see your
stupid face, Hctor.
Come on, its Da de Muertos.
I brought you a little offering.
Get outta here!
I would Chich, but the thing is...
me and my friend Miguel...
we really need to
borrow your guitar.
- My guitar?
- Yes.
My prized, beloved guitar?
I promise we'll bring it right back.
Like the time you promised
to bring back my van?
Eh...
- Or my mini fridge?
- Oh, you see...
Or my good napkins,
my lasso, my femur?!
No, not like those things.
Where's my femur, you...
Oh, oh.
You okay, amigo?
I'm fading, Hctor.
I can feel it.
I couldn't even play that
thing if I wanted to.
You, play me something.
Oh, you know I don't
play anymore, Chich.
The guitar's for the kid.
You want it?
You've got to earn it.
Ay, only for you, amigo.
Any requests?
You know my favorite, Hctor.
Well, everyone knows Juanita
Her eyes each a different color
Her teeth stick out
And her chin goes in
And her...
Knuckles they drag on the floor
Those aren't the words.
There are children present.
Her hair is like a brier
She stands in a
bow-legged stance
And if I weren't so ugly
She'd possibly
give me a chance
Brings back memories.
Gracias.
Wait, what happened?
He's been forgotten.
When there's no one left in the
living world who remembers you...
you disappear from this world.
We call it "The Final Death."
W-where did he go?
No one knows.
But I've met him.
I could remember him...
when I go back.
No, it doesn't work
like that, chamaco.
Our memories...
They have to be passed down
by those who knew us in life.
In the stories
they tell about us.
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Chich's stories.
Hey, it happens to
everyone eventually.
Come on, de la Cruzito,
you've got a contest to win.
You told me you hated musicians.
You never said you were one.
How do you think I knew
your great-great-grandpa?
We used to play music together.
Taught him everything he knows.
No manches.
You played with
Ernesto de la Cruz?
The greatest musician
of all time?
Oh! Oh, you're funny.
Greatest eyebrows
of all time, maybe.
But his music, eh, not so much.
You don't know what
you're talking about.
Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz.
Showtime, chamaco.
Querer lo, t-shirts, bobbleheads.
Bienvenidos a todos!
Ow! ha-hah-ay!
Who's ready for some msica?
It's a Battle of
the Bands, amigos.
The winner gets to play
for the maestro himself...
Ernesto de la Cruz
on his fiesta tonight!
That's our ticket, muchacho.
Let the competition begin!
So, what's the plan?
W-what are you gonna play?
Definitely "Remember Me."
No, not that one. No.
Come on, it's the
most popular song.
Ah, it's too popular.
Remember me
though I have to travel far
Remember...
Don't let it make you cry
Um, what about...
Poco Loco?
Epa! Now, that's a song.
De la Cruzito!
You're on standby.
Los Chachalacos,
you're up next.
Los Chachalacos!
You always this nervous
before a performance?
I don't know.
I've never performed before.
What? You said
you were a musician!
I am! I mean, I-I will be.
- Ay!
- Once I win.
That's your plan?
No, no, no, no.
You have to win, Miguel.
Your life literally
depends on you winning.
And you've never
done this before?
- I'll go up.
- Uh, n-no!
- I need to do this.
- Why?
If I can't go out there
and play one song...
how can I call myself
a musician?
What does that matter?
'Cause I don't just want
to get de la Cruz' blessing.
I need to prove that...
that I'm worthy of it.
Oh. Oh, that's such
a sweet sentiment.
At such a bad time!
Okay! Okay, okay. Okay.
Okay, you wanna perform?
Then you've got to perform!
First, you have to loosen up.
Shake off those nerves.
Now, give me your best grito.
My best grito?
Come on, yell. Belt it out.
Haooeyy-he-he-hey!
Oh, it feels good.
Okay, now, now, now you.
A-a-eh.
Aeh...
Ay...
Ay...ay...
Ay...ay...ay.
Oh, come on, kid.
De la Cruzito!
You're on now!
Miguel, look at me.
Hey, hey, look at me.
Come on, let's go!
You can do this.
Grab their attention
and don't let it go!
Hctor...
Make them listen, chamaco.
You've got this.
De la Cruzito!
Arriba-Ba! Hey!
Eh...
What's he doing?
Why isn't he playing?
Bring back the singing dog!
Hunh!
Aah-aaah-aaayy!
What color is the sky?
Ay, mi amor, ay, mi amor
You tell me that it's red
Ay, mi amor, ay, mi amor
Where should I put my shoes?
Ay, mi amor, ay, mi amor
You say, "put them on your head!"
Ay, mi amor, ay, mi amor
You make me un poco loco
un poquititito loco
The way you keep me guessing
I'm nodding and I'm yesing
I'll count it as a blessing
That I'm only un poco loco
Not bad for a dead guy.
Not so bad yourself, gordito.
Eso!
He's close. Find him.
The loco that you make me
It is just un poco crazy
The sense that you're not making
The liberties you're taking
Leaves my cabeza shaking
You are just un poco loco
Numero uno, Miguelito!
Aah-haa-haaoo!
Rrrr-aaayy-aaayy!
We're looking for a living kid.
About twelve?
Have you seen a living boy?
Un poquiti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti
ti-ti-ti-ti-to loco!
Aaah-aaoah-aah!
Hey! You did good!
I'm proud of you.
Eso!
Hey, where are you going?
We gotta get outta here.
What? You're crazy!
We're about to win this thing.
Damas y caballeros...
I have a emergency announcement.
Please be on the look out
for a living boy.
Answers to the name of Miguel.
Earlier tonight, he ran away
from his family.
They just want to send him
back to the Land of the Living.
Wait, wait, wait.
You said de la Cruz
was your only family.
The only person who
could send you home.
I do have other family, but...
You could have taken my
photo back this whole time?
But they hate music.
I need a musician's blessing.
- You lied to me!
- Oh, you're one to talk.
Look at me, I'm being
forgotten, Miguel.
I don't even know if I'm
gonna last the night.
I'm not gonna miss my one
chance to cross that bridge
'cause you want to live out
some stupid musical fantasy.
- It's not stupid.
- I'm taking you to your family.
- Let go of me.
- You'll thank me later.
You don't wanna help me.
You only care about yourself.
Keep your dumb photo.
- No!
No, no, no!
- Stay away from me!
No!
Hey, chamaco?
Where did you go?
Chamaco?
Sorry!
Come back.
Dante, cllate.
Don't Dante, stop it.
He can't help me.
Dante, stop.
Stop it.
Leave me alone!
You're not a spirit guide,
you're just a dumb dog.
Now get outta here!
It's him!
It's that living boy!
I've heard about him, look!
He's alive.
Huah!
Aah!
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!
I am giving you my blessing,
and you are going home.
I don't want your blessing.
Miguel! Stop!
Come back!
Miguel!
I am trying to save your life.
You're ruining my life.
What?
Music's the only thing
that makes me happy.
A-and you... you wanna
take that away.
You'll never understand.
Y aunque la vida
me cueste, Llorona
No dejar de quererte
I-I thought you hated music.
Oh, I loved it.
I remember that feeling.
When my husband would play,
and I would sing.
And nothing else mattered.
But when we had Coco...
suddenly, there was something in my
life that mattered more than music.
I wanted to put down rules.
He wanted to play for the world.
We each made a sacrifice
to get what we wanted.
Now, you must make a choice.
But I don't wanna pick sides.
Why can't you be on my side?
That's what family's
supposed to do.
Support you.
But you never will.
Have a good time.
Oh, how exciting!
Oh, El Santo!
I-I-I'm a big fan.
You mind if I?
Gracias, seor.
Invitation?
It's okay, I'm Ernesto's
great-great-grandson.
Heh.
Disculpe, seores.
Hey, hey, guys, it's Poco Loco!
You were on fire tonight.
You too!
Hey, musician to musician,
I need a favor.
Oh, the competition winners.
Congratulations, chicos.
Thanks guys.
Oh.
- Hey, enjoy the party, little msico.
- Gracias.
Ooh.
Look, it's Ernesto.
De la Cruz.
Seor de la Cruz!
Pardon me.
Seor de la Cruz!
Seor de la...
When you see your moment,
you mustn't let it pass you by.
You must seize it.
We're almost there, Dante.
Seor de la Cruz!
Seor de la...
But what can we do?
It is hopeless.
You must have faith, sister.
Oh, but Padre,
he will never listen.
He will listen to music.
Rrrr-aaoo-aaoo-aao-aahh!
Seoras y seores
Buenas tardes
Buenas noches
Seoritas y seores
To be here with you tonight
Brings me joy,
Que alegra
For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia
For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia
For this music is my language
And the woo-orld es mi familia
For this music is my Lang-
Ah!
Hunh!
Are you all right, nio?
Huah!
It-it's you.
Y-you are that boy.
The one who came from
the Land of the Living.
You... know about me?
You're all anyone
has been talking about.
Why have you come here?
I'm Miguel.
Your g-great-great-grandson.
I have a great-great-grandson?
I need your blessing.
So I can go back home and
be a musician just like you.
The rest of our family...
they wouldn't listen.
But I... I hoped you would.
My boy, with a talent like yours...
how could I not listen?
Haha! I have a
great-great-grandson!
Look, it's Frida!
Yes, it is I, Frida Kahlo.
It is an honor, seora.
Gracias.
Hey, Negrete, Infante.
Have you met my
great-great-grandson?
My great-great-grandson!
He is alive and a musician, to boot.
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.
No dimple!
To our friendship. Haha!
I'd move heaven and earth
for you, mi amigo. Salud!
Poison!
You know, I did all my own stunts.
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me
All of this came from my amazing
fans in the Land of the Living.
They leave me more offerings
than I know what to do with.
Hey, what's wrong?
Is it too much?
You look overwhelmed.
N-no, It's all great.
- But?
- It's just...
I've been looking up
to you my whole life.
You're the guy
who actually did it.
But did you ever regret it?
Choosing music
over everything else?
It was hard saying
goodbye to my hometown.
Heading off on my own.
Leaving your family?
Si.
But I could not have
done it differently.
One cannot deny
who one is meant to be.
And you, my great-great-grandson...
are meant to be a musician.
You and I, we are artists, Miguel.
We cannot belong to one family.
The world is our family!
Ooh-hoo! Ooh!
The fireworks have begun!
Soon, the party will move across
town for my sunrise spectacular.
Hunh! Miguel, you must
come to the show!
You will be my guest of honor.
- You mean it?
- Of course, my boy.
I can't.
I have to get home
before sunrise.
Oy! I really do need to get you home.
It has been an honor.
I am sorry to see you go, Miguel.
I hope you die very soon.
You know what I mean.
Miguel...
I give you my blessing.
We had a deal, chamaco.
Who are you?
What is the meaning of this?
Oh, Frida. I thought
you couldn't make it.
You said you'd take back my photo.
You promised, Miguel.
You know this uh, man?
I just met him tonight.
He told me he knew you.
H...Hctor?
Please, Miguel.
Put my photo up.
My friend. You're...
you're being forgotten.
And whose fault is that?
- Hctor, please.
- Those were my songs you took.
My songs that made you famous.
- What?
- If I'm being forgotten...
It's because you never told anyone
that I wrote them.
That's crazy. De la Cruz
wrote all his own songs.
You wanna tell him?
Or should I?
Hctor, I never meant to take credit.
We made a great team, but...
you died, and... I-I only sang
your songs because
I wanted to keep
a part of you alive.
Oh, how generous!
You really did play together.
Look, I don't want to fight about it.
I just want you to make it right.
Miguel can put my photo up.
- Hctor.
- And I can cross over the bridge.
I could see my girl.
Ernesto.
Remember the night I left?
That was a long time ago.
We drank together.
And you told me you would move
heaven and earth for your amigo.
Well, I'm asking you to now.
Heaven and earth?
Like in the movie?
What?
That's Don Hidalgo's toast.
In the de la Cruz movie,
"El Camino a Casa."
I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.
No, it's in there.
Look!
This calls for a toast.
To our friendship! Haha!
I would move heaven
and earth for you, mi amigo.
But in the movie, Don Hidalgo
poisons the drink.
Salud.
Poison!
That night, Ernesto.
The night I left.
We've been performing
on the road for months.
I got homesick
and I packed up my songs.
You wanna give up now?
When we're this close
to reaching our dream?
This was your dream.
You'll manage.
I can't do this
without your songs, Hctor.
I'm going home, Ernesto.
Hate me if you want.
But my mind is made up.
Oh, I could never hate you.
If you must go, then I'm...
I'm sending you off with a toast.
To our friendship.
I would move heaven
and earth for you, mi amigo.
Salud!
You walked me to the train station.
But I felt a pain in my stomach.
I thought it must have
been something I ate.
Perhaps it was that chorizo,
my friend.
Or something I drank.
I woke up dead.
You...
poisoned me!
You're confusing movies
with reality, Hctor.
All this time, I thought
it was just bad luck.
I never thought that you might have...
that you...
How could you?
Hctor!
Security! Security!
You took everything away from me!
You rat!
Have him taken care of.
He's not well.
I just wanted to move back home!
No! No!
I apologize.
Where were we?
You were going
to give me your blessing.
Yes... ah... Si.
Miguel...
My reputation... it is...
very important to me.
I would hate to have you think...
That you m-murdered Hctor
for his songs?
You don't think that.
Do you?
I... No... Everyone knows you're the...
the good guy.
Pap Ernesto...
my blessing?
Security?
Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.
What?
But I'm your family!
And Hctor was my best friend.
Success doesn't come
for free, Miguel.
You have to be willing
to do whatever it takes to...
seize your moment.
I know you understand.
No! No!
Let go!
No!
Aah!
Help!
Can anyone hear me?
I wanna go home!
Huh?
H-Hctor?
- Kid?
- Oh, Hctor!
You were right.
I should have gone
back to my family.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- They told me not to be like de la Cruz.
- But I didn't listen.
- Hey, it's okay.
But I told them I didn't care
if they remembered me.
I didn't care if was on
the stupid ofrenda.
Hey, chamaco, it's okay.
It's okay.
I told them I didn't care.
- Huh! Oh!
- Hctor!
Hctor?
She's...
forgetting me.
Who?
My daughter.
She's the reason you wanted
to cross the bridge.
I just wanted to see her again.
I never should have left Santa Cecilia.
I wish I could apologize.
I wish I could tell her that her
Pap was trying to come home.
That he loved her so much.
My Coco.
Coco?
Where?
Where did you get this?
That's my Mam Coco.
That's my Mam Imelda.
Is that...
You?
We're...
- family?
- Family?
I always hoped I'd see her again.
That she'd miss me.
Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.
You know the worst part?
Even if I never got to see
Coco in the living world...
I thought at least one day,
I'd see her here.
Give her the biggest hug.
But she's the last person
who remembers me.
The moment she's gone
from the living world...
You disappear.
From this one.
You'll never get to see her.
Ever again.
You know...
I wrote her a song once.
We used to sing it every night.
At the same time.
No matter how far apart we were.
What I wouldn't give
to sing it to her.
One...
last...
time.
Remember me
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me
Don't let it make you cry
For even if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you
Each night we are apart
Remember me
Pap!
Though I have to travel far
Remember me
Each time you hear a sad guitar
Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be
Until you're in my arms again
Remember
Me
H-He stole your guitar.
He stole your songs.
You should be the one
the world remembers.
Not de la Cruz.
I didn't write "Remember Me"
for the world.
I wrote it for Coco.
I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a
great-great-grandpa.
Are you kidding? A minute ago,
I thought I was related to a murderer.
You're a total upgrade.
My whole life...
there's been something
that made me different.
And I never knew
where it came from.
But now, I know.
It comes from you!
I'm proud we're family.
I'm proud to be his family!
Rrrr-aayy!
Haaa-ooei!
Aaah-haha-ha-aayy!
I'm proud to be
his family!
Haooo-whoo-hoo!
Ho-ha-ay!
Dante?
Dante!
It's Dante!
Haha!
Imelda!
Hctor.
You look good.
Dante!
You knew he was my
Pap Hctor the whole time!
You are a real spirit guide.
Who's a good spirit guide?
You are!
Whoa!
Haha!
Dante!
There they are!
Miguelito! Miguelito!
Gracias, Dios mio!
Mijo, I was so worried.
Thank goodness
we found you in time.
And you.
How many times
must I turn you away?
Imelda...
I want nothing to do with you.
Not in life, not in death.
I spent decades protecting
my family from your mistakes.
He spends five minutes with you,
and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!
I wasn't in there 'cause of Hctor.
He was in there 'cause of me.
He was just trying to get me home.
I didn't wanna listen.
But he was right.
Nothing is more
important than family.
I'm ready to accept your blessing.
And your conditions.
But first, I need to find de la Cruz.
To get Hctor's photo.
- What?
- So he can see Coco again.
Hctor should be on our ofrenda.
He's part of our family.
He left this family.
He tried to go home to you and Coco.
But de la Cruz murdered him.
It's true, Imelda.
And so what if it's true?
You leave me alone
with a child to raise,
and I'm just supposed
to forgive you?
Imelda, I...
Hctor?
Hunh!
I'm running out of time.
It's Coco.
She's forgetting you.
You don't have to forgive him.
But we shouldn't forget him.
I wanted to forget you.
I wanted Coco
to forget you too, but...
This is my fault.
Not yours.
I'm sorry, Imelda.
Miguel...
If we help you get his photo...
you will return home.
No more music.
Family comes first.
I... I can't forgive you.
But I will help you.
So how do we get to
de la Cruz?
I might know a way.
Good luck, muchacho.
Gracias, Frida.
Ah!
Here, let me help you with...
Don't touch me.
Everyone clear on the plan?
Find Hctor's photo.
Give it to Miguel.
Send Miguel home.
Got your petals?
Now, we just have to find de la Cruz.
- Yes?
- Ah!
Don't I know you?
That's for murdering
the love of my life!
- Who the?
- She's talking about me.
I'm the love your your life?
I don't know,
I'm still angry at you.
Hctor? How did you...
And that's for trying
to murder my grandson!
- Grandson?
- She's talking about me.
You!
Wait. You're related to Hctor?
The photo!
Eh...
After him!
Security, ayuda.
You said love of your life?
I don't know what I said.
That's what I heard.
Places, seor.
You're on in 30 seconds.
Miguel, I have it!
Oh!
Hurry, come on!
Ladies and gentleman!
The one. The only.
Ernesto de la Cruz!
Get her off the stage!
Sing!
Sing!
Ay
de m, Llorona
Llorona de azul Celeste
Ay de m, Llorona
Llorona de azul Celeste
Y aunque la vida me cueste,
Llorona
No dejar de quererte
No dejar de quererte
Me sub Al pino ms alto,
Llorona
A ver Si Te divisaba
Como El pino era tierno,
Llorona
Al verme llorar, lloraba
Ay de m, Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul Celeste
Ay de m, Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul Celeste
Y aunque la vida me cueste,
Llorona
No dejar de quererte
Y aunque la vida me cueste
- Let go of me!
Llorona
No dejar de quererte
No dejar de quererte
No dejar de quererte
Ay, ay, ay!
I forgot what that felt like.
You... still got it.
Uh-h-hum...
Oh!
Miguel, I give you my blessing...
To go home...
To put up our photos...
And to never...
Never play music again.
To never forget how much
your family loves you.
You're going home.
You're not going anywhere!
Imelda!
Stay back! Stay back!
All of you, stay back!
Not one more step.
Dante!
Ernesto, stop!
Leave the boy alone.
I've worked too hard, Hctor.
Too hard to let him
destroy everything.
He's a living child, Ernesto.
He's a threat.
You think I'd let him go back to the
Land of the Living with your photo?
To keep your memory alive?
- No.
- You're a coward!
I am Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician of all time.
Hctor's the real musician.
You're just the guy who
murdered him and stole his songs.
Murdered?
I am the one who's
willing to do what it takes
to seize my moment.
Whatever it takes.
Aah! Aah!
No!
- Miguel!
- Miguel!
Apologies, old friend.
But the show must go on.
Haha!
Boo! Boo!
Boo!
Hahaha! Please, please,
mi familia!
- Murderer!
- Get off the stage!
Orchestra, a-one, a-two, a-one...
Remember me
Though I have to s-
Hey, creep!
Look!
Nice kitty.
Ah!
Put me down!
Please!
I'm begging you!
Stop, stop!
Aaah!
Aah! Aaah!
Oooh!
Oh! No!
Aaah!
Hunh!
What did I miss?
Good boy, Dante.
Miguel!
Oh!
Hctor!
The photo, I lost it.
It's okay, mijo.
It's...
Hctor!
Hctor?
Coco.
No, we can still find the photo.
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.
No, no, no.
I can't leave you.
I promised I put your photo up.
I promised you'd see Coco.
We're both out of time, mijo.
No! No!
She can't forget you.
I just wanted her to know...
that I loved her.
Hctor!
You have our blessing, Miguel.
No conditions.
No, Pap Hctor. Please!
No.
Go home.
I promise! I-I won't let
Coco forget you!
There he is!
Miguel! Stop!
Where have you been?
Ah! I need to see
Mam Coco, please!
Huh! What are you doing with that?
Give it to me!
Miguel, stop.
Miguel! Miguel?
Miguel!
Mam Coco?
Can you hear me?
It's Miguel.
I-I saw your Pap!
Remember? Pap?
Please.
If you forget him.
He'll be gone.
Forever.
Here. This was his guitar, right?
He used to play it to you?
See, there he is.
Pap, remember? Pap?
Miguel!
Mam Coco, please.
Don't forget him.
What are you doing
to that poor woman?
It's okay, mother.
What's gotten into you?
I thought I lost you, Miguel.
I'm sorry, Pap.
We're all together now.
That's what matters.
Not all of us.
It's okay, Mamita.
Miguel, you apologize
to your Mam Coco.
Mam Coco...
Well, apologize.
Mam Coco...
Your Pap...
He wanted you to have this.
Mam... wait...
Remember me
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me
Don't let it make you cry
For even if I'm far away
- Look!
I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you
Each night we are apart
Remember me
Though I have to travel far
Remember me
Each time you hear a sad guitar
Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be
Until you're in my arms again
Remember
Me
Elena?
What's wrong, mija?
Nothing, Mam.
Nothing at all.
My Pap used to
sing me that song.
He loved you, Mam Coco.
Your Pap loved you so much.
I kept his letters.
Poems he wrote me.
And...
Pap was a musician.
When I was a little girl...
He and Mam would sing
such beautiful songs.
One year later
Remember me
Forgotten.
And right over here,
one of Santa Cecilia's
greatest treasures.
The home of the esteemed
songwriter, Hctor Rivera.
The letters Hctor wrote
home for his daughter, Coco
contain the lyrics for all
of your favorite songs.
Not just "Remember Me."
And that man is your Pap Julio.
And there's Ta Rosita.
And your Ta Victoria.
And those two are
Oscar and Felipe.
There aren't just old pictures,
they're our family.
And they're counting on us
to remember them.
Say that I'm crazy
- Next.
Or call me a fool
Enjoy your visit, Hctor.
But last night it seemed
that I dreamed about you
Pap!
Coco!
And you knew every word
And we all sang along
To a melody played
On the strings of our souls
And a rhythm that rattled us
Down to the bone
Our love for each other
Will live on forever
In every beat
Of my proud corazn
Our love for each other
Will live on forever
In every beat
Of my proud corazn
Ay mi familia
Oiga mi gente
Canten a coro
Let it be known
Our love for each other
Will live on forever
In every beat
Of my proud corazn
Ay mi familia
Oiga mi gente
Canten a coro
Let it be known
Our love for each other
Will live on forever
In every beat
Of my proud corazn
Get up! Get up!
The winner, by total annihilation...
Yama!
Who is next?
Who has the guts to step into
the ring with little yama?
Yama!
Can I try?
I have a robot. I built it myself.
Beat it, kid.
House rules. You gotta pay to play.
Is this enough?
What's your name, little boy?
Hiro. Hiro hamada.
Prepare your bot, zero.
Two bots enter,
one bot leaves.
Fighters ready?
Fight!
That was my first fight.
I... can I try again?
No one likes a sore loser, little boy.
Go home.
I've got more money.
Fighters ready?
Fight!
Mega-bot, destroy.
What?
-No more little yama.
-But, wha...
This is not possible!
Hey, I'm as surprised as you are.
Beginner's luck.
Do you want to go again, yama?
-No one hustles yama!
-Whoa. Hey...
Teach him a lesson.
Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this.
-Hiro! Get on!
-Tadashi!
Good timing!
Oh, mama!
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
-Are you hurt?
-No.
Then what were you thinking,
knucklehead?
You graduated high school
when you were 13,
and this is what you're doing?
There they are!
Hey!
Hold on!
Yes!
Get back here.
Bot fighting is illegal.
You're going to get yourself arrested.
Bot fighting is not illegal.
Betting on bot fighting,
that's... that's illegal.
But so lucrative!
I'm on a roll, big brother!
And there is no stopping me!
Oh, no.
Hi, aunt cass.
Are you guys okay?
Tell me you're okay.
-We're fine.
-We're okay.
Oh, good.
Then what were you
two knuckleheads thinking?
For 10 years,
I have done the best I could
to raise you.
Have I been perfect? No.
Do I know anything about children? No.
Should I have picked up a book
on parenting?
Probably!
Where was I going with this?
I had a point.
-Sorry.
-We love you, aunt cass.
Well, I love you, too!
I had to close up early
because of you two felons.
On beat poetry night.
Stress eating. Because of you.
Come on, mochi.
This is really good!
You better make this up to aunt cass
before she eats everything in the cafe.
For sure.
And I hope you learned
your lesson, bonehead.
Absolutely.
You're going bot fighting, aren't you?
There's a fight across town.
If I book, I can still make it.
When are you gonna
start doing something
with that big brain of yours?
What? Go to college like you?
So people can tell me stuff
I already know?
Unbelievable.
What would mom and dad say?
I don't know.
They're gone.
They died when I was three, remember?
Hey!
-I'll take you.
-Really?
I can't stop you from going,
but I'm not going
to let you go on your own.
Sweet.
What are we doing at your nerd school?
Bot-fight's that way!
Gotta grab something.
Is this gonna take long?
Relax, you big baby.
We'll be in and out.
Anyway, you've never seen my lab.
Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab!
Heads up!
Electro-mag suspension?
Hey!
-Who are you?
-I'm...
Go go, this is my brother Hiro.
Welcome to the nerd lab.
Yeah.
I've never seen electro-mag
suspension on a bike before.
Zero resistance, faster bike.
But, not fast enough...
...yet.
Do not move. Behind the line, please.
Hey, wasabi. This is my brother Hiro.
Hello, Hiro. Prepare to be amazed.
Catch.
Wow.
-Laser-induced plasma?
-Oh, yeah.
With a little magnetic confinement
for ultra-precision.
Wow. How do you find anything
in this mess?
I have a system.
There's a place for everything,
and everything in its place.
-Need this!
-You can't do that!
This is anarchy! Society has rules!
Excuse me!
Coming through!
Tadashi!
Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro!
I've heard so much about you!
Perfect timing. Perfect timing.
That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.
400 pounds of it!
Come here, come here, come here.
You're going to love this.
A dash of perchloric acid,
a smidge of cobalt,
a hint of hydrogen peroxide,
super-heated to 500 Kelvin, and...
Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh?
It's so pink.
Here's the best part.
I know, right?
Chemical metal embrittlement.
Not bad, honey lemon.
"Honey lemon"? "Go go"? "Wasabi"?
I spill wasabi on my shirt
one time, people.
One time!
Fred is the one who comes up
with the nicknames.
Who's Fred?
This guy, right here!
Don't be alarmed. It is just a suit.
This is not my real face and body.
The name's Fred.
School mascot by day, but by night...
I am also a school mascot.
So, what's your major?
No, no, no, I'm not a student.
But I am a major science enthusiast.
I've been trying to get
honey to develop a formula,
that can turn me into
a fire-breathing lizard at will.
But she says that's "not science."
It's really not.
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray
I asked wasabi for
isn't "science" either.
-Is it?
-Nope.
Well, then, what about
"invisible sandwich"?
-Hiro.
-Imagine eating a sandwich,
but everybody just thinks you're crazy.
Just stop.
-Laser eyes?
-What?
-Tingly fingers?
-Never gonna happen.
Hey, what about a growth serum?
So, what have you been working on?
I'll show you.
Duct tape?
I hate to break it to you, bro.
Already been invented.
Hey!
Dude!
Ow!
This is what I've been working on.
Hello. I am baymax.
Your personal healthcare companion.
I was alerted to the need
for medical attention
when you said, "ow."
A robotic nurse.
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?
Physical or emotional?
I will scan you now.
Scan complete.
You have a slight epidermal
abrasion on your forearm.
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.
What's in the spray, specifically?
The primary ingredient is bacitracin.
That's a bummer.
I'm actually allergic to that.
You are not allergic to bacitracin.
You do have a mild allergy to
peanuts.
Not bad.
You've done some serious
coding on this thing, huh?
Programed him with
over 10,000 medical procedures.
This chip is what
makes baymax, baymax.
Vinyl?
Yeah, going for a non-threatening,
huggable kind of thing.
Looks like a walking marshmallow.
-No offense.
-I am a robot.
I cannot be offended.
-Hyperspectral cameras?
-Yep.
-Titanium skeleton?
-Carbon fiber.
Right. Even lighter.
Killer actuators.
Where did you get those?
Machined them right here, in-house.
-Really?
-Yup.
He can lift 1,000 pounds.
Shut up.
You have been a good boy.
Have a lollipop.
Nice.
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.
Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.
He's going to help a lot of people.
Hey, what kind of battery does it use?
Lithium ion.
You know, supercapacitors
would charge way faster.
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. hamada?
Hey, Professor.
Actually, I was just finishing up.
You must be Hiro.
Bot-fighter, right?
When my daughter was younger,
that's all she wanted to do.
May I?
Sure.
Magnetic-bearing servos.
Pretty sick, huh?
Wanna see how I put 'em together?
Hey, genius!
He invented them.
You're Robert Callaghan?
Like, as in,
the Callaghan-catmull spline,
and Callaghan's "laws of robotics?"
That's right.
Ever think about applying here?
Your age wouldn't be an issue.
I don't know.
He's pretty serious about
his career in bot-fighting.
Well, kind of serious.
I can see why.
With your bot, winning must come easy.
Yeah, I guess.
Well, if you like things easy,
then my program isn't for you.
We push the boundaries
of robotics here.
My students go on to shape the future.
Nice to meet you, Hiro.
Good luck with the bot-fights.
We gotta hurry if you
want to catch that bot-fight.
I have to go here.
If I don't go to this nerd school,
I'm gonna lose my mind.
How do I get in?
Every year, the school has
a student showcase.
You come up with something
that blows Callaghan away, you're in.
But, it's gotta be great.
Trust me.
It will be.
Nothing!
No ideas! Useless, empty brain!
Wow. Washed up at 14.
So sad.
I got nothing! I'm done.
I'm never getting in.
Hey, I'm not giving up on you.
What are you doing?
Shake things up.
Use that big brain of yours
to think your way out.
-What?
-Look for a new angle.
Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today.
How are you feeling?
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter.
Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.
Yep, he's nervous.
You have nothing to fear, little fellow.
-He's so tense.
-No, I'm not.
Relax, Hiro.
Your tech is amazing. Tell him, go go.
-Stop whining. Woman up.
-I'm fine!
What do you need, little man?
Deodorant? Breath mint?
Fresh pair of underpants?
Underpants? You need serious help.
Hey, I come prepared.
I haven't done laundry in six months.
One pair lasts me four days.
I go front, I go back, I go inside-out.
Then I go front and back.
Wow. That is both
disgusting and awesome.
Don't encourage him.
It's called "recycling."
Next presenter, Hiro hamada.
Oh, yeah. This is it.
I guess I'm up.
Okay, photo, photo!
Everybody say, "Hiro."
-Hiro!
-Yeah!
We love you, Hiro. Good luck!
-Don't mess it up.
-Break a leg, little man.
Science, yeah!
All right, bro. This is it.
Come on. Don't leave me hanging.
What's going on?
I really want to go here.
Hey.
You got this.
Hi.
My name is Hiro...
Sorry.
My name is Hiro hamada,
and I've been working on something
that I think is pretty cool.
I hope you like it.
This is a microbot.
Breathe.
It doesn't look like much,
but when it links up
with the rest of its pals...
...things get a little more interesting.
The microbots are controlled
with this neural transmitter.
I think what I want them to do...
They do it.
The applications for this tech
are limitless.
Construction.
What used to take teams
of people working by hand
for months or years,
can now be accomplished
by one person.
And that's just the beginning.
How about transportation?
Microbots can move
anything anywhere,
with ease.
If you can think it,
the microbots can do it.
The only limit is your imagination.
Microbots!
That's my nephew!
Yes!
My family! I love my family!
Nailed it!
-You did it!
-Not bad!
Yeah! You just blew my mind, dude!
They loved you. That was amazing!
Yes.
With some development,
your tech could be revolutionary.
Alistair krei!
May I?
Extraordinary.
I want your microbots at krei tech.
Shut up.
Mr. krei is right.
Your microbots are
an inspired piece of tech.
You can continue to develop them,
or you can sell them to a man
who's only guided
by his own self-interest.
Robert, I know how you feel about me,
but it shouldn't affect...
This is your decision, Hiro.
But you should know
Mr. krei has cut corners
and ignored sound science
to get where he is.
That's just not true.
I wouldn't trust krei tech
with your microbots,
or anything else.
Hiro, I'm offering you more money
than any 14-year-old could imagine.
I appreciate the offer, Mr. krei,
but they're not for sale.
I thought you were smarter than that.
Robert.
Mr. krei.
That's my brother's.
That's right.
I look forward to seeing you in class.
Unbelievable!
That's what I'm talking about.
All right, geniuses,
let's feed those hungry brains.
Back to the caf!
Dinner is on me!
Yes! Nothing is better than free food!
-Aunt cass?
-Unless it's moldy.
We'll... we'll catch up, okay?
Sure. I'm so proud of you.
Both of you.
Thanks, aunt cass.
I know what you're going to say.
"I should be proud of myself,"
"because I'm finally using my gift
for something important."
No, no. I was just gonna tell you
your fly was down for the whole show.
Ha-ha-hilarious.
What?
Welcome to nerd school, nerd.
Hey, I, um...
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you. So,
you know,
thanks for not giving up on me.
Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm okay.
But Professor Callaghan is still in there.
Tadashi, no!
Callaghan's in there.
Someone has to help.
Tadashi!
Tadashi!
Here. Have some tea.
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, aunt cass.
Mrs. matsuda's in the caf.
She's wearing something
super inappropriate for an 80-year-old.
That always cracks you up.
You should come down.
Maybe later.
The university called again.
It's been a few weeks
since classes started.
But they said it's not too late to register.
Okay. Thanks. I'll think about it.
Hey, Hiro.
We just wanted to check in,
and see how you're doing.
We wish you were here, buddy.
Hiro, if I could have only
one superpower right now,
it would be the ability
to crawl through this camera,
and give you a big hug.
Ow!
Hello. I am baymax,
your personal healthcare companion.
Hey, baymax.
I didn't know you were still active.
I heard a sound of distress.
What seems to be the trouble?
I just stubbed my toe a little.
I'm fine.
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?
A zero. I'm okay, really.
Thanks. You can shrink now.
Does it hurt when I touch it?
That's okay. No touching.
I'm fine...
Ow.
You have fallen.
You think?
-On a scale of 1 to...
-Ow!
On a scale...
On a sca...
On a scale of 1 to 10...
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?
Zero.
-It is all right to cry.
-No. No, no, no, no.
Crying is a natural response to pain.
I'm not crying.
-I will scan you for injuries.
-Don't scan me.
-Scan complete.
-Unbelievable.
You have sustained no injuries.
However, your hormone
and neurotransmitter levels
indicate that you are
experiencing mood swings
common in adolescence.
Diagnosis, puberty.
What?
Okay. Time to shrink now.
You should expect an increase
in body hair,
especially on your face,
chest, armpits, and...
Thank you! That's enough.
You may also experience
strange and powerful new urges.
Okay! Let's get you
back in your luggage.
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.
Fine. I'm satisfied with my...
My microbot?
This doesn't make any sense.
Puberty can often be a confusing time
for a young adolescent
flowering into manhood.
No. The thing is attracted
to the other microbots,
but that's impossible.
They were destroyed in the fire.
Dumb thing's broken.
Your tiny robot
is trying to go somewhere.
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you find out
where it's trying to go?
Would that stabilize
your pubescent mood swings?
Absolutely.
Baymax?
Baymax?
Baymax?
What?
-Hiro?
-Hey, aunt cass!
Wow. You're up and...
Yeah! I figured it was time.
Are you registering for school?
Yes.
I thought about what you said.
Really inspired me.
Oh, honey, that's so great.
Okay,
special dinner tonight.
I'll whip up some chicken wings.
You know, with the hot sauce
that makes our faces numb.
-Okay, sounds good.
-Great!
Last hug.
Baymax!
-Baymax!
-Hey!
Watch it!
Baymax!
Baymax!
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
I have found where
your tiny robot wants to go.
I told you, it's broken.
It's not trying to go...
Locked.
There is a window.
Please exercise caution.
A fall from this height
could lead to bodily harm.
Oh, no.
Excuse me while I let out some air.
Are you done?
Yes.
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.
Fine, just keep it down.
My microbots?
Someone's making more.
Hiro?
You gave me a heart attack!
My hands are equipped
with defibrillators. Clear.
Stop, stop, stop! It's just an expression.
Oh, no.
Run!
Oh, come on!
I am not fast.
Yeah, no kidding!
Go! Go! Come on.
Kick it down!
Then punch it!
Go! Go!
Oh, come on! Go, go, go!
Move it!
Come on!
No, no.
Come on! The window!
Suck it in!
Baymax!
Hiro?
Come on, let's get out of here.
Go! Hurry!
All right, let me get this straight.
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you,
with an army of miniature flying robots.
"Microbots."
-Microbots.
-Yeah.
He was controlling them telepathically
with a neurocranial transmitter.
So, Mr. kabuki was using esp
to attack you and balloon man.
Did you file a report
when your flying robots were stolen?
No. I thought they were all destroyed.
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but baymax was there, too.
-Tell him.
-Yes, officer.
He's telling the truth.
What the... what's wrong with you?
Low battery.
Try to keep it together.
I'm healthcare,
your personal baymax companion.
Kid, how about we call your parents
-and get them down here?
-What?
Write your name and number down
on this piece of paper, and we can...
I've gotta get you home
to your charging station.
Can you walk?
I will scan you now. Scan complete.
Healthcare.
Okay.
If my aunt asks,
we were at school all day. Got it?
We jumped out a window.
No! Quiet!
We jumped out a window.
You can't say things like that
around aunt cass.
Hiro?
You home, sweetie?
That's right.
I thought I heard you. Hi.
Hey, aunt cass.
Look at my little college man.
I can't wait to hear all about it!
And wings are almost ready.
Whee!
Will you be quiet?
Yeah, wings! Whee!
All right, get ready to have
your face melted.
We are gonna feel
these things tomorrow.
You know what I'm saying?
Okay.
Sit down. Tell me everything.
The thing is that,
since I registered so late,
I've got a lot of school stuff
to catch up on.
What was that?
Mochi.
That darn cat.
At least take a plate for the road, okay?
-Don't work too...
-Thanks for understanding.
Hairy baby. Hairy baby.
All right, come on.
I'm healthcare,
your personal baymax companion.
One foot in front of the other.
This doesn't make any sense.
Tadashi.
What?
Tadashi.
Tadashi's gone.
When will he return?
He's dead, baymax.
Tadashi was in excellent health.
With a proper diet and exercise,
he should have lived a long life.
Yeah, he should have.
But there was a fire and...
Now, he's gone.
-Tadashi is here.
-No.
People keep saying
he's not really gone.
As long as we remember him.
It still hurts.
I see no evidence of physical injury.
It's a different kind of hurt.
You are my patient.
I would like to help.
You can't fix this one, buddy.
What are you doing?
I am downloading
a database on personal loss.
Database downloaded.
Treatments include contact
with friends and loved ones.
I am contacting them now.
No, no, no! I... don't do that.
Your friends have been contacted.
Unbelievable.
Now, what are you doing?
Other treatments include
compassion and physical reassurance.
I'm okay. Really.
You will be all right. There, there.
Thanks, baymax.
I am sorry about the fire.
It's okay. It was an accident.
Unless...
Unless it wasn't.
At the showcase,
that guy in the mask
stole my microbots. And...
And then set the fire to cover his tracks.
He's responsible for tadashi.
We gotta catch that guy.
It's alive!
It's alive, it's alive! It's alive!
If we're gonna catch that guy,
you need some upgrades.
Will apprehending the man in the mask
improve your emotional state?
Absolutely.
Let's work on your moves.
Now, let's take care of this.
I have some concerns.
This armor may undermine
my non-threatening, huggable design.
That's kind of the idea, buddy.
You look sick.
I cannot be sick. I am a robot.
It's just an expression.
Data transfer complete.
I fail to see how karate makes me
a better healthcare companion.
You want to keep me healthy,
don't you?
Punch this.
Yes! Hammerfist!
Side kick!
Knifehand!
Back kick!
Gummy bears!
Yes!
Yeah! Fist bump!
"Fist bump" is not in
my fighting database.
No, this isn't a fighting thing.
It's what people do sometimes
when they're excited or pumped up.
Hey, now you're getting it.
I will add "fist bump"
to my care-giving matrix.
All right. Let's go get that guy.
Come on!
Get him, baymax!
We're too late.
Your tiny robot
is trying to go somewhere.
Come on.
Always wait one hour after eating
before swimming.
Hey!
Come on!
Your heart rate has
increased dramatic...
Okay, baymax,
time to use those upgrades.
-Hiro?
-No, no, no!
Get out of here! Go!
Dude, what are you doing out here?
Nothing! Just out for a walk.
Helps my pubescent mood swings.
Is that baymax?
Yeah, but you really...
Why is he wearing
carbon fiber underpants?
I also know karate.
You guys need to go.
No, don't push us away, Hiro.
We're here for you.
That's why baymax contacted us.
Those who suffer a loss,
require support
from friends and loved ones.
Okay, but I...
Who would like
to share their feelings first?
I'll go. Okay.
My name is Fred, and it has
been 30 days since my last...
Holy mother of megazon!
Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no!
Go!
Baymax, get him!
No, no, no, no, no! What are you doing?
I'm saving your life.
Baymax can handle that guy!
Oh, no.
Wasabi!
Goodbye!
Hiro. Explanation. Now.
He stole my microbots.
He started the fire.
I don't know who he is!
Baymax, palm-heel strike!
Hard left!
That mask, the black suit...
We're under attack
from a super villain, people!
I mean, how cool is that?
I mean, it's scary, obviously.
But how cool!
Why are we stopped?
The light's red!
There are no red lights in a car chase!
Why is he trying to kill us?
Why are you trying to kill us?
It's classic villain.
We've seen too much!
Let's not jump to conclusions.
We don't know he's trying to kill us.
Car!
He's trying to kill us!
Did you just put your blinker on?
You have to indicate your turn!
It's the law!
That's it.
Stop the car!
Baymax and I can take this guy!
Seatbelts save lives.
Buckle up, every time.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
-Did we lose him?
-Look out!
Baymax, hold on!
-We're not gonna make it!
-We're gonna make it!
-We're not gonna make it!
-We're gonna make it!
-We're not gonna make it!
-We're gonna make it!
We made it! Yes!
I told you we'd make it!
Your injuries require my attention.
And your body temperatures are low.
We should get out of here.
I know a place.
Where are we?
Fred.
Where are you going?
Welcome to mi casa.
That's French for "front door."
It's really not.
Listen, nitwit.
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.
I'm not in the mood for any...
Welcome home, master Frederick.
Heathcliff, my man!
Come on in, guys. We'll be safe in here.
Gimme some.
Freddie,
this is your house?
I thought you lived under a bridge.
Well, technically,
it belongs to my parents.
They're on a vacay on the family island.
You know, we should
totally go some time. Frolic.
You gotta be kidding me.
If I wasn't just attacked
by a guy in a kabuki mask,
I think this would be
the weirdest thing I've seen today.
My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.
Your body temperature is still low.
Yeah.
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.
It's so nice.
Oh, yeah, that's toasty.
Good robot.
Does this symbol
mean anything to you guys?
-Yes! It's a bird!
-No!
The guy in the mask was carrying
something with this symbol on it.
Apprehending the man in the mask
will improve Hiro's emotional state.
Apprehend him?
We don't even know who he is.
I have a theory.
"Dr. slaughter, md"?
Actually, millionaire weapons designer,
Malcolm chazzletick.
"The annihilator"?
Behind the mask,
industrialist reid axworthy.
"Baron Von destruct"?
Just get to the point!
Don't you guys get it?
The man in the mask who attacked us
is none other than...
Voil!
Alistair krei.
-What?
-Think about it.
Krei wanted your microbots,
and you said no.
But rules don't apply to a man like krei.
There's no way.
The guy is too high profile.
Then who was that guy in the mask?
I don't know.
We don't know anything about him.
His blood type is ab-negative.
Cholesterol levels are...
Baymax, you scanned him?
I am programed to assess
everyone's healthcare needs.
Yes!
I can use the data
from your scan to find him.
You'd have to scan
everyone in San fransokyo.
That might take, I don't know, forever.
No, no, no, no. I...
I just have to look for another angle.
Got it!
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.
I just have to upgrade baymax's sensor.
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,
I need to upgrade all of you.
Upgrade who, now?
Those who suffer a loss require support
from friends and loved ones.
Okay, I like where this is heading!
We can't go against that guy!
We're nerds!
Hiro, we want to help,
but we're just us.
No.
You can be way more.
Tadashi hamada was our best friend.
We're in.
Can you feel it?
You guys, do you feel this?
Our origin story begins.
We're gonna be superheroes!
Arms up.
The neurotransmitter
must be in his mask.
We get the mask,
and he can't control the bots.
Game over.
They say
"we are what we are"
but we don't have to be
I'm bad behavior
but I do it in the best way
I'll be the watcher
of the eternal flame
I'll be the guard dog
of all your fever dreams
I am the sand in the bottom
half of the hourglass
'cause we could be immortals
immortals
just not for long
for long
live with me forever now
pull the blackout curtains down
just not for long
for long
we could be immortals
immortals
immortals
immortals
sometimes the only payoff
for having any faith
is when it's tested again
and again
every day
I'm still comparing your past
to my future
'cause we could be immortals
immortals
just not for long
for long
super jump!
Super jump!
And live with me forever now
pull the blackout curtains down
-I breathe fire.
-Just not for long
for long
we could be immortals
immortals
immortals
immortals
immortals
immortals
immortals
immortals
immortals
I love it!
Not bad.
Anybody else's suit riding up on them?
Hey, guys!
Check this out.
I'd like to introduce,
baymax 2.0.
He's glorious.
Hello.
Hold up. Focus.
Show 'em what you got, buddy.
The fist, show them the fist.
No, not that.
The thing, the other thing.
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!
That's just one of his new upgrades!
Baymax, wings.
No way!
Thrusters.
I fail to see how flying
makes me a better
healthcare companion.
I fail to see how you fail to see
that it's awesome!
Full thrust.
Steady, big guy.
Look, let's just take this slow.
Up, up, up, up, up!
Thrust, thrust, thrust!
Too much thrust! Too much thrust!
Too much thrust!
No, no, no, no!
Back on! Back on!
On! On! On!
Zoom...
Go up! Up, up, up!
Up!
Oh, man!
Maybe...
Maybe enough flying for today.
What do you say?
Your neurotransmitter levels
are rising steadily.
Which means what?
The treatment is working.
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no!
Whoa, baymax!
Yes!
Yeah!
Yes!
Wow!
That was...
That was...
Sick.
It is just an expression.
That's... that's right, buddy.
I am never taking the bus again.
Your emotional state has improved.
I can deactivate if you say
you are satisfied with your care.
What?
No, I don't want you to deactivate.
We still have to find that guy.
So, fire up that super-sensor.
Functionality improved.
1000% increase in range.
I have found a match...
...on that island.
-Killer view.
-Yeah. If I...
If I wasn't terrified of heights,
I'd probably love this.
But I'm terrified of heights,
so I don't love it.
There. Baymax, take us in.
Awesome!
Our first landing together as a team.
Guys, come on.
"Quarantine"?
Do you people know
what "quarantine" means?
"Quarantine." Enforced isolation
to prevent contamination
that could lead to disease,
or, in some cases, death.
There's a skull face on this one.
A skull face!
Be ready.
He could be anywhere.
Fire!
Spitting fire! Spitting fire!
That was a bird.
Well, at least we know our gear works.
Six intrepid friends
led by Fred
their leader, Fred
Fred's angels
Fred's angels
harnessing the power of the sun
with the ancient amulet
they found in the attic
the amulet is green
it's probably an emerald
Fred, I will laser-hand you in the face.
Guys.
Any sign of him, baymax?
This structure is
interfering with my sensor.
Perfect. The robot's broken.
Guys, you might want to see this.
What do you think it is, genius?
I'm not sure. But look.
Hiro.
Krei.
That's right.
We were asked to do the impossible.
That's what we did.
We've reinvented
the very concept of transportation.
Friends, I present
project silent sparrow.
General, may I?
Magic hat!
Teleportation.
The transport of matter
instantaneously through space.
Not science fiction anymore.
Now, we didn't spend billions
of tax dollars
to teleport hats.
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're here to witness history.
Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?
We've invited all these people.
Might as well give 'em a show.
T-minus 30 seconds to launch.
-29... 28...
-This is argo.
-Capsule's in position.
-27...
Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity
in the magnetic containment field.
Mr. krei, is there a problem?
No. No problem.
It's well within the parameters.
Let's move forward.
3... 2... 1...
Cabin pressure is go.
Pod engaged.
Field breach! Abort!
We've lost all contact with the pod.
Oh, no.
-It's breaking up!
-The pilot is gone.
Portal two is down.
The magnetic
containment field's down!
Krei, shut it down now!
I want this island sealed off!
The government shut down
krei's experiment.
And he's using your microbots
to steal his machine back.
Krei is the guy in the mask.
Oh, no.
Baymax, get us out of here.
Go for the transmitter.
Behind his mask.
Baymax!
All right, what's the plan?
It's Fred time.
Super jump!
Gravity crush!
Falling hard.
Seriously, what is the plan?
-Get the mask.
-Right behind you.
For real, what is the plan?
Hey!
Hey!
You want to dance, masked man?
'Cause you'll be dancing with these.
Hand over the mask,
or you'll get a taste of this!
And a little bit of that!
Hey! I did all right.
Is that all you got?
You got that, too?
It's back into the fire!
It's over, krei.
Pro... Professor Callaghan?
The explosion...
You died.
No. I had your microbots.
But, tadashi.
You just let him die.
Give me the mask, Hiro.
He went in there to save you!
That was his mistake!
Baymax, destroy.
My programing prevents me
from injuring a human being.
Not anymore.
Hiro, this is not what...
Do it, baymax! Destroy him!
No! Stop, baymax!
No, stop! He's getting away!
Baymax!
My healthcare protocol
has been violated.
I regret any distress I may have caused.
How could you do that? I had him!
What you just did,
we never signed up for.
We said we'd catch the guy.
That's it.
I never should have let you help me!
Baymax, find Callaghan.
My enhanced scanner
has been damaged.
Wings.
Hiro, this isn't part of the plan.
Fly!
Hiro!
Your blood pressure is elevated.
You appear to be distressed.
I'm fine!
There. Is it working?
-My sensor is operational.
-Good.
Then let's get...
What?
Are you going to remove
my healthcare chip?
Yes. Open!
My purpose is to heal
the sick and injured.
Baymax, open your access port.
Do you want me to terminate
Professor Callaghan?
Just open!
Will terminating Professor Callaghan
improve your emotional state?
Yes! No! I don't know!
Open your access!
-Is this what tadashi wanted?
-It doesn't matter!
Tadashi programed me to aid and...
Tadashi's gone!
Tadashi's gone.
Tadashi is here.
No. He's not here.
Tadashi is here.
This is tadashi hamada.
And this is the first test
of my robotics project.
Hello, I am baymax.
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
The seventh test of my robotics project.
Hello, I...
What? What?
Wait, wait, wait, stop!
Stop scan! Stop...
Tadashi hamada again,
and this is the 33rd test
of my robotics project.
I'm not giving up on you.
You don't understand this yet,
but people need you.
So, let's get back to work.
This is tadashi hamada,
and this is the 84th test.
What do you say, big guy?
Hello, I am baymax,
your personal healthcare companion.
It works.
It works!
This is amazing! You... you work!
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it.
I knew it. Oh, you work.
I can't believe it! I can't...
Okay. All right, big moment, here.
Scan me.
Your neurotransmitter
levels are elevated.
This indicates that you are happy.
I am. I really am.
Oh, man. Wait till my brother sees you.
You're gonna help
so many people, buddy.
So many.
That's all for now.
I am satisfied with my care.
Thank you, baymax.
I'm so sorry.
I guess I'm not like my brother.
Hiro.
Guys, I... I...
We're going to catch Callaghan,
and, this time, we'll do it right.
But maybe don't leave your team
stranded on a spooky island next time.
-Oh, man.
-Nah, it's cool.
Heathcliff picked us up
in the family chopper.
Hiro, we found something
you should see.
You almost got us all killed!
Krei! You did this!
You knew it wasn't ready!
Callaghan? He was there?
He was such a good man.
What happened?
I don't know.
But the answer's here somewhere.
Wait, wait! Stop.
There he is.
With the pilot.
Hang on.
We've invited all these people...
The pilot was Callaghan's daughter.
Callaghan blames krei.
This is a revenge story.
So, what are we waiting for?
It's all set up.
This beautiful new campus
is the culmination of a lifelong dream.
But none of this
would've been possible
without a few bumps in the road.
Those setbacks made us stronger,
and set us on the path
to a bright future.
What is that?
-What?
-Setback?
Was my daughter a "setback"?
Callaghan! But you...
Your daughter, that...
That was an accident.
No! You knew it was unsafe.
My daughter is gone
because of your arrogance.
What are you doing?
You took everything from me when
you sent Abigail into that machine.
Now I'm taking everything from you.
No!
No! No! You can't!
You're going to watch
everything you've built disappear.
Then, it's your turn.
Professor Callaghan!
Let him go!
Is this what Abigail would've wanted?
Abigail is gone!
This won't change anything.
Trust me, I know.
Listen to the kid, Callaghan.
Please, let me go.
I'll give you anything you want!
I want my daughter back!
Go for the mask!
Baymax!
Leaping into action!
Oh, no!
Getting a little tight.
-No!
-He's too strong!
-There's no way out!
-You can't beat him!
Help! I can't beat him.
Hiro!
-Hiro? Hiro?
-Help!
-That's it!
-Hiro.
-I know how to beat him.
-Hiro.
Listen up!
Use those big brains of yours
and think your way
around the problem.
Look for a new angle.
My arms! They can't go any further!
Wait a second, it's a suit.
Hello, sign.
Care to go for a little spin?
Double spin!
Behind-the-back spin!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Baymax!
Hiro.
I love that robot!
Okay, new plan. Forget the mask.
Take out the bots.
They'll get sucked up into the portal.
Now that is a plan!
Honey, Fred,
can you give us some cover?
Like you have to ask.
Let's do this, Freddie!
Smokescreen!
Ready and
dive!
Whoa, the gravity's getting
a little weird here, guys!
Wait.
Let's use this!
These are green blades of fury!
Woman up!
Double sign-spin.
Now my signs are on fire!
Now that's a chemical reaction!
Back kick. Knifehand. Roundhouse.
Hammerfist.
This ends now!
Looks like you're out of microbots.
What?
Baymax!
No!
Our programing prevents us
from injuring a human being.
But we'll take that.
It's still on! We have to shut it down!
We can't!
The containment field is failing.
The portal is gonna tear itself apart!
We need to get out of here, now!
Baymax!
My sensor is detecting signs of life.
-What?
-Coming from there.
The life signs are female.
She appears to be in hyper-sleep.
Callaghan's daughter. She's still alive.
Abigail.
Let's go get her.
The portal is destabilizing.
You'll never make it.
She's alive in there.
Someone has to help.
What do you say, buddy?
Flying makes me
a better healthcare companion.
Careful! There's krei
tech debris everywhere.
Look out!
I have located the patient.
Hurry!
Come on, buddy, let's get her home.
I'll guide you out of here. Let's go!
Veer right!
Okay, to the left.
Hard right!
Up and over.
Okay, level off. Easy.
Nice flying!
Almost there!
Baymax!
Baymax!
My thrusters are inoperable.
Just grab hold.
There is still a way
I can get you both to safety.
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.
No, no, no, no. Wait. What about you?
-You are my patient.
-Baymax.
Your health is my only concern.
Stop! I'm gonna figure out...
Are you satisfied with your care?
No. There's gotta be another way.
I'm not gonna leave you here.
I'll think of something.
There is no time.
Are you satisfied with your care?
Please! No...
I can't lose you, too.
Hiro,
I will always be with you.
I'm satisfied with my care.
Hiro!
Yeah! They made it!
Baymax?
Miss, can you hear me?
What is your name?
Abigail Callaghan.
Okay, Abigail, you are gonna be fine.
We're taking you to the hospital.
Move it!
Get in there.
A massive cleanup continues today
at the headquarters
of krei tech industries.
Reports are still flooding in about
a group of unidentified individuals,
who prevented what could have been
a major catastrophe.
The whole city
of San fransokyo is asking,
"who are these heroes?
And where are they now?"
-Hey.
-Hi.
It's so exciting.
Hey, sweetie!
Okay.
Last hug.
Bye!
-And just then I was like...
-Get out of here.
Ow?
I am baymax,
your personal healthcare companion.
Hello, Hiro.
We didn't set out to be superheroes,
but sometimes life doesn't go
the way you planned.
The good thing is, my brother
wanted to help a lot of people,
and that's what we're gonna do.
Who are we?
Dad, I just wish I could share
my accomplishments with you.
You mean so much to me, and honestly,
I've always felt a distance
what with you being
on the family island all the time,
and I just wish you could see how...
Fred.
Son.
Dad?
I wear 'em front, I wear 'em back.
I go inside out, then I go front and back.
Dad!
We have a lot to talk about.
Although each of the world's countries
would like to dispute this fact,
we French know the truth:
The best food in the world
is made in France.
The best food in France
is made in Paris.
And the best food in Paris, some say,
is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.
Gusteau's restaurant
is the toast of Paris,
booked five months in advance.
And his dazzling ascent
to the top of fine French cuisine
has made his competitors envious.
He is the youngest chef ever
to achieve a five-star rating.
Chef Gusteau's cookbook,
Anyone Can Cook!
climbed to the top of the bestseller list.
But not everyone
celebrates its success.
Amusing title, Anyone Can Cook!
What's even more amusing is that
Gusteau actually seems to believe it.
I, on the other hand,
take cooking seriously.
And, no, I don't think anyone can do it.
This is me.
I think it's apparent
I need to rethink my life a little bit.
What's my problem?
First of all, I'm a rat.
Which means life is hard.
And second, I have a highly developed
sense of taste and smell.
Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean...
Oh! Small twist of lemon.
Whoa, you can smell all that?
You have a gift.
This is Emile, my brother.
He's easily impressed.
So you can smell ingredients?
So what?
This is my dad. He's never impressed.
He also happens to be
the leader of our clan.
So, what's wrong
with having highly developed senses?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't eat that!
- What's going on here?
Turns out that funny smell
was rat poison.
Suddenly, Dad didn't think
my talent was useless.
I was feeling pretty good about my gift,
until Dad gave me a job.
Clean.
Clean.
That's right. Poison checker.
Cleanerific.
Cleanerino.
Close to godliness.
Which means clean.
You know, cleanliness is close to...
Never mind. Move on.
Well, it made my dad proud.
Now, don't you feel better, Remy?
You've helped a noble cause.
Noble? We're thieves, Dad.
And what we're stealing is,
let's face it, garbage.
It isn't stealing if no one wants it.
If no one wants it,
why are we stealing it?
Let's just say
we have different points of view.
This much I knew:
If you are what you eat,
then I only want to eat the good stuff.
But to my dad...
Food is fuel.
You get picky about what you put
in the tank, your engine is gonna die.
Now shut up and eat your garbage.
Look, if we're going to be thieves,
why not steal the good stuff
in the kitchen,
where nothing is poisoned?
First of all, we are not thieves.
Secondly, stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans.
It's dangerous.
I know
I'm supposed to hate humans,
but there's something about them.
They don't just survive.
They discover, they create.
I mean,
just look at what they do with food.
How can I describe it?
Good food is like music you can taste,
color you can smell.
There is excellence all around you.
You need only be aware to stop
and savor it.
Oh, Gusteau was right.
Oh, mmm, yeah.
Oh, amazing.
Each flavor was totally unique.
But combine one flavor with another,
and something new was created.
So now I had a secret life.
The only one who knew about it
was Emile.
Hey, Emile. Emile.
I found a mushroom.
Come on, you're good at hiding food.
Help me find a good place to put this.
He doesn't understand me,
but I can be myself around him.
Why are you walking like that?
I don't want to constantly
have to wash my paws.
Did you ever think about how we walk
on the same paws
that we handle food with?
You ever think about
what we put into our mouths?
All the time.
When I eat, I don't want to taste
everywhere my paws have been.
Well, go ahead.
But if Dad sees you walking like that,
he's not going to like it.
What have you got there?
Ah, oh, oh...
You found cheese?
And not just any cheese.
Tomme de chvre de pays!
That would go beautifully
with my mushroom.
And...
This rosemary! This rosemary
with maybe with a few drops
from this sweet grass.
Well, throw it on the pile, I guess,
and then we'II... You know...
We don't want to throw this in
with the garbage. This is special.
But we're supposed
to return to the colony
before sundown or,
you know, Dad's gonna...
Emile!
There are possibilities
unexplored here.
We got to cook this.
Now, exactly how we cook this
is the real question...
Yeah.
The key is to keep turning it.
Get the smoky flavor nice and even.
That storm's getting closer.
Hey, Remy, you think that maybe
we shouldn't be so...
You got to taste this!
This is... It's got this kind of...
It's burny, melty...
It's not really a smoky taste.
It's a certain... It's kind of like a...
It's got, like, this "ba-boom, zap"
kind of taste. Don't you think?
- What would you call that flavor?
- Lightning-y?
Yeah. It's lightning-y!
We got to do that again.
Okay, when the next storm comes,
we'll go up on the roof...
I know what this needs! Saffron!
A little saffron would make this!
Saffron. Why do I get the feeling
- it's in the kitchen?
- It's in the kitchen.
Saffron.
- Not good.
Saffron.
Don't like it. She's gonna wake up.
I've been down here a million times.
She turns on the cooking channel,
boom, she never wakes up.
You've been here a million times?
I'm telling you, saffron will be
just the thing. Gusteau swears by it.
Okay. Who's Gusteau?
Just the greatest chef in the world.
Wrote this cookbook.
Wait. You read?
- Well, not excessively.
- Oh, man. Does Dad know?
You could fill a book, a lot
of books, with things Dad doesn't know.
And they have, which is why I read.
Which is also our secret.
I don't like secrets.
All this cooking
and reading and TV-watching
while we read and cook.
It's like you're involving me in crime,
and I let you.
Why do I let you?
What's taking those kids so long?
Ah, I'Aquila saffron. Italian. Huh?
Gusteau says it's excellent.
Good thing the old lady is a food love...
Forget mystique.
This is about your cooking.
Hey! That's Gusteau. Emile, look.
Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart.
Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart.
You must be imaginative,
strong hearted.
You must try things that may not work.
And you must not let anyone
define your limits
because of where you come from.
Your only limit is your soul.
What I say is true. Anyone can cook.
But only the fearless can be great.
Pure poetry.
But it was not to last.
Gusteau's restaurant lost
one of its five stars
after a scathing review
by France's top food critic, Anton Ego.
It was a severe blow to Gusteau,
and the brokenhearted chef
died shortly afterwards,
which, according to tradition,
meant the loss of another star.
Gusteau is dead?
Oh!
Oh! Oh!
Oh!
Run!
No, you'll lead her to the colony!
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!
Try to grab you.
Emile, swing to me.
Evacuate! Everyone, to the boats.
Let me through!
- The book.
Let me through!
- The book.
Excuse me. Move, move.
Go, go, go, go. Move, move, move.
Get the bridge up! Move it, move it!
Hey, Johnny! Hurry!
Push off. Come on.
Get hold!
- Take the baby. Here!
- Give me your paw.
Hey, wait for me!
Is everybody here?
Do we have everybody?
- Wait a minute. Where's Remy?
- Right here. I'm coming.
I'm coming!
Hold on, Son.
Give him something to grab on to.
Come on, boy. Paddle, Son.
Come on. Reach for it.
You can do it.
- Remy!
- Dad!
Come on. You can make it.
You can make it.
Guys, wait. Stop!
Remy. Come on. Paddle.
Hold on! Wait for me. Hold on.
Dad?
Dad?
Which way?
I waited
for a sound,
a voice,
a sign,
something.
If you are hungry,
go up and look around, Remy.
Why do you wait and mope?
Well, I've just lost my family,
all my friends,
probably forever.
- How do you know?
- Well, I...
You are an illustration.
Why am I talking to you?
Well, you just lost your family,
all your friends. You are Ionely.
Yeah. Well, you're dead.
Ah, but that is no match
for wishful thinking.
If you focus on what you've left behind,
you'll never be able to see
what lies ahead.
Now go up and look around.
Oh!
Champagne!
What are you doing?
I'm hungry.
I don't know where I am,
and I don't know
when I'll find food again.
Remy, you are better than that.
You are a cook.
A cook makes. A thief takes.
You are not a thief.
But I am hungry.
Food will come, Remy.
Food always comes
to those who love to cook.
- You think I am playing?
- You don't have the guts.
Paris?
All this time
I've been underneath Paris?
Wow.
It's beautiful.
The most beautiful.
Gusteau's? Your restaurant?
You've led me to your restaurant.
It seems as though I have. Yes.
There it is! I have led you to it!
I got to see this.
Ready to go on table seven.
Coming around.
One order of steamed pike up.
Coming up.
I need
more soup bowls, please.
I need two rack of lamb.
I need more leeks.
I need two salmon, three
salade compose, and three filet.
Three orders
of salade compose working.
Firing two orders, seared salmon.
Three filet working. I need plates.
Fire seven.
Three salade compose up.
Don't mess with my mise!
Open down low.
I'm getting buried here.
Hello, Chef Skinner.
How your night be now?
Bonjour, chef.
Hello, Chef Skinner.
- Evening, chef.
Ordering deux filet.
Hey, boss, look who is here.
Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy.
- Hi.
- All grown up, eh?
You remember Renata,
Gusteau's old flame?
- Yes. How are you...
- Linguini.
Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit.
How is...
- My mother?
- Renata.
- Yes, Renata. How is she?
- Good.
Well, not... She's been better. I mean...
She died.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Oh, don't be. She believed in heaven,
so she's covered.
You know, afterlife-wise?
- What's this?
- She left it for you.
I think she hoped it would help me,
you know, get a job here.
But of course.
Gusteau wouldn't hesitate.
Any son of Renata's is more than...
Yes, well, we could file this
and if something suitable opens up...
We have already hired him.
What? How dare you hire someone
without my...
We needed a garbage boy.
Oh, garbage. Well...
I'm glad it worked out.
Uh...
I can't believe it.
A real gourmet kitchen,
and I get to watch.
You've read my book.
Let us see how much you know, huh?
Which one is the chef?
Oh! Uh...
- Oh, that guy.
- Very good.
Who is next in command?
The sous chef. There.
The sous is responsible for the kitchen
when the chef's not around.
Saucier, in charge of sauces.
Very important.
Chef de partie, demi chef de partie,
both important.
Commis, commis, they're cooks.
Very important.
You are a clever rat. Now, who is that?
Oh, him? He's nobody.
Not nobody. He is part of the kitchen.
No, he's a plongeur or something.
He washes dishes or takes out
the garbage. He doesn't cook.
- But he could.
- Uh, no.
How do you know?
What do I always say?
Anyone can cook.
Well, yeah, anyone can.
That doesn't mean that anyone should.
Well,
that is not stopping him. See?
What is he doing?
No. No! No, this is terrible!
He's ruining the soup.
And nobody's noticing?
It's your restaurant. Do something.
What can I do?
I am a figment of your imagination.
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...
Table five coming up,
right now.
Coming down the line.
Set.
Ah!
Hot! Open oven!
Ah!
Coming around.
Ooh!
Oui, chef.
One filet mignon, three lamb, two duck.
Fire those souffls
for table six, ja.
Five minutes, chef.
- Oh, God.
Tonight,
I'd like to present the foie gras.
It has a wonderful finish.
Ooh!
- Ah!
Hmm.
Ready to go on table seven.
Come on! Let's go!
Oui, chef.
Remy! What are you waiting for?
Is this going to become a regular thing
with you?
You know how to fix it.
This is your chance.
The soup! Where is the soup?
Out of my way.
Move it, garbage boy!
You are cooking?
How dare you cook in my kitchen?
Where do you get the gall
to even attempt something
so monumentally idiotic?
I should have you drawn
and quartered!
I'll do it. I think the law is on my side.
Larousse, draw and quarter this man
after you put him in the duck press
to squeeze the fat out of his head.
- What are you blathering about?
- The soup!
Soup?
Stop that soup!
No!
Waiter.
Linguini!
You're fired!
F-l-R-E-D! Fired!
She wants to see the chef.
But he...
- What did the customer say?
- It was not a customer. It was a critic.
- Ego?
- Solene LeClaire.
- LeClaire? What did she say?
- She likes the soup.
- Wait.
- What do you mean, "Wait"?
You're the reason I'm in this mess.
Someone is asking about your soup.
What are you playing at?
Am I still fired?
You can't fire him.
- What?
LeClaire likes it, yeah?
She made a point of telling you so.
If she write a review to that effect
and find out you fired
the cook responsible...
- He's a garbage boy.
- Who made something she liked.
How can we claim to represent
the name of Gusteau
if we don't uphold
his most cherished belief?
And what belief is that,
Mademoiselle Tatou?
Anyone can cook.
Perhaps I have been a bit harsh
on our new garbage boy.
He has taken a bold risk
and we should reward that,
as Chef Gusteau would have.
If he wishes
to swim in dangerous waters,
who are we to deny him?
- You were escaping?
- Oh, yeah.
Since you have expressed
such an interest in his cooking career,
you shall be responsible for it.
Anyone else?
Then back to work.
You are either very lucky
or very unlucky.
You will make the soup again,
and this time, I'll be paying attention.
Very close attention.
They think you might be a cook.
But you know what I think, Linguini?
I think you are a sneaky,
overreaching little...
Rat!
- Rat!
Get the rat.
Linguini. Get something to trap it.
It's getting away.
Get it, get it, get it.
- What should I do now?
- Kill it.
- Now?
- No, not in the kitchen. Are you mad?
Do you know what would happen to us
if anyone knew
we had a rat in our kitchen?
They'd close us down.
Our reputation is hanging by a thread
as it is.
Take it away from here. Far away.
Kill it. Dispose of it. Go!
Whoa!
Doh!
Don't look at me like that!
You aren't the only one who's trapped.
They expect me to cook it again!
I mean, I'm not ambitious.
I wasn't trying to cook.
I was just trying to stay out of trouble.
You're the one who was getting fancy
with the spices!
What did you throw in there? Oregano?
No? What? Rosemary?
That's a spice, isn't it? Rosemary?
You didn't throw rosemary in there?
Then what was all the flipping
and all the throwing the...
I need this job. I've lost so many.
I don't know how to cook, and now
I'm actually talking to a rat as if you...
Did you nod?
Have you been nodding?
You understand me?
So I'm not crazy!
Wait a second, wait a second.
I can't cook, can I?
But you...
You can, right?
Look, don't be so modest.
You're a rat, for Pete's sake.
Whatever you did, they liked it.
Yeah. This could work.
Hey, they liked the soup!
They liked the soup.
Do you think you could do it again?
Okay, I'm going to let you out now.
But we're together on this. Right?
Okay.
So this is it.
I mean, it's not much, but it's,
you know...
Not much.
It could be worse.
There's heat and light
and a couch with a TV.
So, you know, what's mine is yours.
Are you...
Is this a dream?
The best kind of dream.
One we can share.
But why here?
Why now?
Why not here?
Why not now?
What better place to dream
than in Paris?
Morning, Little Chef. Rise and...
Oh, no.
Idiot! I knew this would happen!
I let a rat into my place
and tell him what's mine is his!
Eggs, gone!
Stupid! He's stolen food
and hit the road! What did I expect?
That's what I get for trusting a...
Hi. Is that for me?
Mmm!
That's good. What did you put in this?
Where'd you get that?
Look, it's delicious. But don't steal.
I'll buy some spices, okay?
Oh, no. We're going to be late.
And on the first day!
Come on, Little Chef!
"Though I, like many other critic,
"had written off Gusteau as irrelevant
since the great chef's death,
"the soup was a revelation.
A spicy yet subtle taste experience."
- Solene LeClaire?
- Yes!
"Against all odds,
Gusteau's has recaptured our attention.
"Only time will tell if they deserve it."
Well...
You know.
Look, I know it's stupid and weird,
but neither of us can do this alone,
so we got to do it together, right?
You with me?
So let's do this thing!
I...
Welcome to hell.
Now, recreate the soup.
Take as much time as you need.
All week if you must.
Soup.
You little...
Ow!
You son of a...
You got...
This is not going to work, Little Chef!
I'm going to lose it
if we do this anymore.
We've got to figure out something else.
Something that doesn't involve
any biting, or nipping,
or running up and down my body
with your little rat feet.
The biting! No! Scampering! No!
No scampering or scurrying.
Understand, Little Chef?
Little Chef?
Oh, you're hungry.
Okay. So let's think this out.
You know how to cook,
and I know how to appear
human.
We need to work out a system
so that I do what you want
in a way that doesn't look like
I'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef.
Would you listen to me? I'm insane!
I'm insane! I'm insane!
In a refrigerator talking to a rat
about cooking in a gourmet restaurant.
- I will never pull this off!
- Linguini?
We gotta communicate.
I can't be constantly checking
for a yes or no head shake from a...
The rat! I saw it!
- A rat?
- Yes, a rat. Right next to you.
What are you doing in here?
I'm just familiarizing myself with,
you know, the vegetables and such.
Get out.
One can get too familiar
with vegetables, you know!
That was close. Are you okay up there?
Whoa!
How did you do that?
That's strangely involuntary!
One look and I knew
we had the same crazy idea.
Okay.
Huh?
Where are you taking me? Wait.
Whoa!
Wait. I'm sorry.
Whoa!
Okay.
Mmm-hmm...
Okay.
Whoa!
Whoa!
votre sant!
All right.
That should do it.
Mmm.
Congratulations. You were able to
repeat your accidental success.
But you'll need to know more than soup
if you are to survive in my kitchen, boy.
Colette will be responsible for
teaching you how we do things here.
Listen, I just want you to know
how honored I am
to be studying under such...
No! You listen. I just want you to know
exactly who you are dealing with.
How many women
do you see in this kitchen?
Well, I...
- Only me. Why do you think that is?
- Well, I...
Because haute cuisine
is an antiquated hierarchy
built upon rules
written by stupid old men.
Rules designed to make it impossible
for women to enter this world.
But still I'm here. How did this happen?
Because, well, because you...
Because I am the toughest cook
in this kitchen.
I've worked too hard
for too long to get here
and I am not going to jeopardize it
for some garbage boy who got lucky.
Got it?
Wow!
Easy to cook. Easy
to eat. Gusteau makes Chinese food
Chine-easy.
- Excellent work, Franois, as usual.
- It's good, isn't it?
I want you to work up something
for my latest frozen food concept.
Gusteau's Corn Puppies.
They're like corn dogs, only smaller.
Bite size.
What are corn dogs?
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.
Whip something up.
Maybe Gusteau in overalls
and Huckleberry Tom hat.
Or as a big ear of corn
in doggie make-up.
Yes.
But, please, with dignity.
Get my lawyer!
Well, the will stipulates
that if after a period of two years
from the date of death
no heir appears,
Gusteau's business interests
will pass to his sous chef. You.
I know what the will stipulates.
What I want to know is if this letter...
If this boy changes anything!
There's not much resemblance.
There's no resemblance at all.
He is not Gusteau's son.
Gusteau had no children,
and what of the timing of all this?
The deadline in the will
expires in less than a month!
Suddenly,
some boy arrives with a letter
from his recently deceased mother
claiming Gusteau is his father?
Highly suspect!
- This is Gusteau's?
- Yes, yes, yes.
- May I?
- Of course.
But the boy does not know.
She claims she never told him,
or Gusteau, and asks that I not tell.
- Why you? What does she want?
- A job for the boy.
- Only a job?
- Well, yes.
Then what are you worried about?
If he works here,
you'll be able to keep an eye on him
while I do a little digging.
Find out how much of this is real.
I will need you
to collect some DNA samples
from the boy. Hair, maybe.
Mark my words.
The whole thing is highly suspect.
He knows something.
Relax, he's a garbage boy.
I think you can handle him.
What are you doing?
I'm cutting vegetables.
I'm cutting vegetables?
No! You waste energy and time!
You think cooking is a cute job,
like Mommy in the kitchen?
Well, Mommy never had to face
the dinner rush when the orders
come flooding in,
and every dish is different
and none are simple,
and all of the different cooking times,
but must arrive on the customer's table
at exactly the same time,
hot and perfect!
Every second counts,
and you cannot be Mommy!
What is this? Keep your station clear!
When the meal rush comes,
what will happen?
Messy stations slow things down.
Food doesn't go, orders pile up.
Disaster.
I'll make this easy to remember.
Keep your station clear,
or I will kill you!
Your sleeves
look like you threw up on them.
Keep your hands and arms in,
close to the body. Like this. See?
Always return to this position.
Cooks move fast. Sharp utensils,
hot metal, keep your arms in.
You will minimize cuts and burns
and keep your sleeves clean.
Mark of a chef:
Messy apron, clean sleeves.
I know the Gusteau style cold.
In every dish, Chef Gusteau
always has something unexpected.
I will show you.
I memorize all his recipe.
- Always do something unexpected.
- No. Follow the recipe.
- But you just said that...
- No, no, no.
It was his job to be unexpected.
It is our job to...
- Follow his recipes.
- Follow the recipe.
How do you tell how good bread is
without tasting it?
Not the smell, not the look,
but the sound of the crust.
Listen.
Symphony of crackle.
Only great bread sound this way.
The only way to get the best produce
is to have first pick of the day
and there are only two way
to get first pick.
Grow it yourself, or bribe a grower.
Voil! The best restaurant get first pick.
People think haute cuisine is snooty.
So chef must also be snooty.
But not so.
Lalo there ran away from home at 12.
Got hired by circus people
as an acrobat.
And then he get fired
for messing around
with the ringmaster's daughter.
Horst has done time.
LINGUINl: What for?
No one know for sure. He changes
the story every time you ask him.
I defrauded a major corporation.
I robbed the second largest bank
in France using only a ballpoint pen.
I created a hole in the ozone
over Avignon.
I killed a man with this thumb.
Don't ever play cards
with Pompidou.
He's been banned from Las Vegas
and Monte Carlo.
- Larousse ran gun for the Resistance.
- Which resistance?
He won't say.
Apparently, they didn't win.
So you see.
We are artist, pirate.
More than cooks are we.
- We?
- Oui. You are one of us now, oui?
Oui. Thank you, by the way,
for all the advice about cooking.
- Thank you, too.
- For what?
For taking it.
Huh?
The rat!
- But he is a...
- I just dropped my keys.
Have you decided this evening?
- Your soup is excellent. But...
- But we order it every time.
- What else do you have?
- Well, we have a very nice foie gras.
I know about the foie gras.
The old standby,
used to be famous for it.
What does the chef have that's new?
- Someone has asked what is new!
- New?
Yes. What do I tell them?
- Well, what did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!
What are you blathering about?
- Customers are asking what is new.
- What should I tell them?
- What did you tell them?
- I told them I would ask!
This is simple.
Just pull out an old Gusteau recipe,
something we haven't made
in a while...
They know about the old stuff.
They like Linguini's soup.
They are asking for food from Linguini?
A lot of customers like the soup.
That's all we are saying.
Were we saying that?
Very well. If it's Linguini they want
tell them Chef Linguini has prepared
something special for them.
Something definitely off menu.
Oh, and don't forget to stress
- its Linguini-ness.
- Oui, chef.
Now is your chance to try something
worthy of your talent, Linguini.
A forgotten favorite of the chef's,
sweetbread la Gusteau.
- Colette will help you.
- Oui, chef.
Now, hurry up. Our diners are hungry.
Are you sure?
That recipe was a disaster.
Gusteau himself said so.
Just the sort of challenge
a budding chef needs.
"Sweetbread la Gusteau.
"Sweetbread cooked
in a seaweed salt crust
"with cuttlefish tentacle,
dog rose pure,
"geoduck egg, dried white fungus?
"Anchovy licorice sauce."
I don't know this recipe,
but it's Gusteau's, so...
Lalo! We have
some veal stomach soaking, yes?
Yes!
The veal stomach, I get that.
Veal stomach?
Oh!
Okay.
I'll be right back. Where...
Hey, I got to... Hey!
Don't mind me.
I just need to borrow this real quick.
Let's see, over here...
I'll be back.
Thank you.
Excuse me. I'm going to...
Apparently, I need this. I'll be right...
I'm going to pick that up.
I got some of that spice.
Okay.
What are you doing? You're supposed
to be preparing the Gusteau recipe.
This is the recipe.
The recipe doesn't call
for white truffle oil!
What else have you...
You are improvising?
This is no time to experiment.
The customer are waiting.
You're right. I should listen to you!
- Stop that!
- Stop what?
Freaking me out!
Whatever you are doing, stop it.
Where is the special order?
- Coming!
- I thought we were together on this.
- We are together.
- Then what are you doing?
- It's very hard to explain.
- The special?
- Come get it!
Whoa, whoa.
I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce.
- Don't you dare.
- I'm not, I'm not. I'm...
Sorry.
Is Linguini's dish done yet?
Ja. It's as bad as we remember.
Just went out.
- Did you taste it?
- Ja, of course, before he changed it.
Good. What? How could he change it?
He changed it
as it was going out the door!
Ow!
They love it!
Other diners are already
asking about it, about Linguini.
I have seven more orders!
That's wonderful.
I'd like one of those.
Special order!
What is that?
Special order! Special order!
Special order!
To Linguini.
- Congratulations, Mr. Linguini.
- Cheers, ja?
Drink now, there's plenty.
Take a break, Little Chef. Get some air.
We really did it tonight.
Dah!
Got your toque!
Oh, seriously now.
I'd love to have a little talk with you,
Linguini, in my office.
- Am I in trouble?
- Trouble? No.
A little wine, a friendly chat.
Just us cooks.
The plongeur won't be coming to you
for advice anymore, eh, Colette?
He's gotten all he needs.
Toasting your success, eh, Linguini?
Good for you.
I just took it to be polite.
I don't really drink, you know.
Of course you don't.
I wouldn't either if I was drinking that.
But you would have to be an idiot
of elephantine proportions
not to appreciate
this '61 Chteau Latour.
And you, Monsieur Linguini,
are no idiot.
Let us toast your non-idiocy.
- Remy!
- Emile?
I can't believe it! You're alive!
- You made it!
- I thought I'd never see you guys again!
We figured
you didn't survive the rapids.
And what are you eating?
I don't really know.
I think it was
some sort of wrapper once.
What? No.
You're in Paris now, baby. My town.
No brother of mine eats rejectamenta
in my town.
Remy! You are stealing?
You told Linguini he could trust you.
- And he can. It's for my brother.
- But the boy could lose his job.
Which means I would, too.
It's under control, okay?
- More wine?
- I shouldn't, but... Okay.
So, where did you train, Linguini?
Train? All right.
Surely you don't expect me to believe
this is your first time cooking?
- It's not.
- I knew it!
It's my... Second, third, fourth...
Fifth time.
Monday was my first time.
But I've taken out the garbage
lots of times before that...
Yes, yes. Have some more wine.
Tell me, Linguini, about your interests.
Do you like animals?
What?
Animals? What kind?
The usual, dogs, cats, horses,
guinea pigs,
rats.
I brought you something to...
No, no, no, no!
Spit that out right now!
- Don't just work it down!
- Too late.
Here.
Chew it slowly.
Only think about the taste.
- See?
- Not really.
Creamy, salty sweet,
an oaky nuttiness.
- You detect that?
- Oh, I'm detecting nuttiness.
Close your eyes. Now taste this.
Whole different thing, right?
Sweet, crisp, slight tang on the finish.
- Okay.
- Now, try them together.
Okay.
I think I'm getting
a little something there.
- It might be the nuttiness.
- See?
- Could be the tang.
- That's it.
Now, imagine every great taste
in the world
being combined
into infinite combinations.
Tastes that no one has tried yet!
Discoveries to be made!
I think...
- You lost me again.
- Yeah.
But that was interesting.
Most interesting garbage I ever...
Hey! What are we doing?
Dad doesn't know you're alive yet!
We've got to go to the colony!
Everyone will be thrilled!
- Yeah! But...
- What?
Thing is, I kind of have to...
What do you "have to"
more than family?
What's more important here?
Well, I...
It wouldn't hurt to visit.
- Have you had a pet rat?
- No.
- Did you work in a lab with rats?
- No.
Perhaps you lived in squalor
at some point?
Nopety nopety no.
You know something about rats!
You know you do!
You know who know do whacka-doo.
Ratta-tatta.
- Hey! Why do they call it that?
- What?
Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right?
Why do they call it that?
If you're going to name a food,
you should give it a name
that sounds delicious.
Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious.
It sounds like "rat" and "patootie."
Rat patootie.
Which does not sound delicious.
Regrettably we are all out of wine.
My son has returned!
And finding someone to replace you
for poison checker has been a disaster.
Nothing's been poisoned, thank God,
but it hasn't been easy.
- You didn't make it easy.
- I know. I am sorry, Dad.
Well, the important thing
is that you're home.
Yeah, well, about that...
You look thin. Why is that?
A shortage of food,
or a surplus of snobbery?
It's tough out there in the big world
all alone, isn't it?
Sure, but it's not like I'm a kid anymore.
- Hey. Hey, boy. What's up?
- I can take care of myself.
I've found a nice spot not far away,
so I'll be able to visit often.
Nothing like a cold splash of reality
to make you...
- Visit?
- I will. I promise. Often.
- You're not staying?
- No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just...
You didn't think
I was going to stay forever, did you?
Eventually,
a bird's got to leave the nest.
We're not birds. We're rats.
We don't leave our nests.
We make them bigger.
- Well, maybe I'm a different kind of rat.
- Maybe you're not a rat at all.
Maybe that's a good thing.
Hey! The band's
really on tonight, huh?
Rats. All we do is take, Dad.
I'm tired of taking.
I want to make things.
I want to add something to this world.
- You're talking like a human.
- Who are not as bad as you say.
- Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?
- Oh, man.
I've been able to
observe them
at a close-ish sort of range.
- Yeah? How close?
- Close enough.
And they're, you know,
not so bad as you say they are.
Come with me.
I got something I want you to see.
You know, I'm going to stay here.
Make sure the floors and countertops
are clean before you lock up.
Wait. You want me to stay and clean?
Is that a problem?
- No.
- Good boy. See you tomorrow.
We're here.
Take a good long look, Remy.
Now, this is what happens
when a rat gets
a little too comfortable around humans.
The world we live in
belongs to the enemy.
We must live carefully.
We look out for our own kind, Remy.
When all is said and done,
we're all we've got.
- No.
- What?
No. Dad, I don't believe it.
You're telling me that the future is...
Can only be more of this?
This is the way things are.
You can't change nature.
Change is nature, Dad.
The part that we can influence.
And it starts when we decide.
- Where you going?
- With luck, forward.
Hey! Yeah.
Stop it.
Good morning.
Good morning.
So, the chef,
he invited you in for a drink?
That's big.
That's big. What did he say?
What?
What, you can't tell me?
Oh!
Forgive me for intruding on your deep,
personal relationship with the chef.
Oh, I see how it is.
You get me to teach you
a few kitchen tricks
to dazzle the boss
and then you blow past me?
Wake up. Wake up.
I thought you were different.
I thought you thought I was different.
I thought...
I didn't have to help you!
If I looked out only for myself,
I would have let you drown!
But...
I wanted you to succeed. I liked you.
My mistake.
Colette. Wait, wait. Colette!
It's over, Little Chef.
I can't do it anymore.
Colette! Wait, wait!
Don't motorcycle away.
Look, I'm no good with words.
I'm no good with food either.
At least not without your help.
I hate false modesty.
It's just another way to lie.
- You have talent.
- No, but I don't! Really! It's not me.
When I added that extra ingredient
instead of following the recipe
like you said,
that wasn't me either.
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I wouldn't have done that.
I would've followed the recipe.
I would've followed your advice.
I would've followed your advice
to the ends of the earth.
- Because I love your advice.
- But...
But I...
Don't do it.
I have a secret. It's sort of disturbing.
- I have a...
- What? You...
- I have a ra...
- You have a rash?
No, no, no. I have this...
This tiny little...
Little...
A tiny chef
who tells me what to do.
A tiny chef?
Yes. Yes. He's...
- He's up here.
- In your brain?
Why is it so hard to talk to you?
Okay. Here we go.
You inspire me. I'm going to risk it all.
I'm going to risk looking like the
biggest idiot psycho you've ever seen.
You want to know why
I'm such a fast learner?
You want to know why
I'm such a great cook?
Don't laugh! I'm going to show you!
No! No!
- What is it, Ambrister?
- Gusteau's.
- Finally closing, is it?
- No.
- More financial trouble?
- No, it's...
Announced a new line
of microwave egg rolls?
What? What? Spit it out.
It's come back. It's popular.
- I haven't reviewed Gusteau's in years.
- No, sir.
My last review condemned it
- to the tourist trade.
- Yes, sir.
I said, "Gusteau has finally
found his rightful place in history
"right alongside
another equally famous chef,
"Monsieur Boyardee."
Touch.
That is where I left it.
That was my last word.
- The last word.
- Yes.
Then tell me, Ambrister,
how could it be popular?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
The DNA matches, the timing works,
everything checks out.
He is Gusteau's son.
This can't just happen!
The whole thing is a setup!
The boy knows!
Look at him out there,
pretending to be an idiot.
He's toying with my mind
like a cat with a ball of... Something.
- String?
- Yes! Playing dumb.
- Taunting me with that rat.
- Rat?
Yes. He's consorting with it.
Deliberately trying to make me think
it's important.
- The rat.
- Exactly!
Is the rat important?
Of course not!
He just wants me to think that it is.
Oh, I see the theatricality of it.
A rat appears on the boy's first night,
I order him to kill it.
And now he wants me
to see it everywhere.
Ooh!
It's here! No, it isn't, it's here!
Am I seeing things, am I crazy?
Is there a phantom rat or is there not?
But, oh, no!
I refuse to be sucked into
his little game of...
Should I be concerned about this?
About you?
Huh?
I can't fire him. He's getting attention.
If I fire him now,
everyone will wonder why.
And the last thing I want
is people looking into this.
What are you so worried about?
Isn't it good to have the press?
Isn't it good to have Gusteau's name
getting headlines?
Not if they're over his face!
Gusteau's already has a face,
and it's fat and lovable and familiar.
And it sells burritos!
Millions and millions of burritos!
The deadline passes in three days.
Then you can fire him
whenever he ceases to be valuable
and no one will ever know.
I was worried
about the hair sample you gave me.
- I had to send them back to the lab.
- Why?
Because the first time it came back
identified as rodent hair.
- No, no, no.
- LINGUINl: What?
Try this. It's better.
Well, because you...
Whoa!
Rat!
Disgusting little creatures.
I was reminded
how fragile it all was.
How the world really saw me.
And it just kept getting better.
Remy!
Remy!
Psst! Psst!
Hey, hey, hey, little brother!
We were afraid you weren't going to,
you know, show up.
- Hey, Remy! How you doing?
- You told them?
Emile,
that's exactly what I said not to do!
But you know these guys.
They're my friends.
I didn't think you meant them.
Look, I'm sorry.
Don't tell me you're sorry,
tell them you're sorry.
- Is there a problem over here?
- No, there is not.
Wait here.
It's locked?
Hmm...
Remy, what are you doing in here?
Okay. Emile shows up with...
Okay, I said not to. I told him...
He goes and blabs to...
Yeah, it's a disaster.
Anyway, they're hungry, the food safe
is locked and I need the key.
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...
It's complicated. It's family.
They don't have your ideals.
Ideals?
If Chef Fancy Pants had any ideals,
you think I'd be hawking barbecue
over here?
Or microwave burritos?
Or, Tooth, I say,
Tooth Pick'n Chicken?
About as French as a corn dog!
Coming soon!
We're inventing new ways
to sell out over here.
Will ye be wanting some haggis bites?
I cannot control
how they use my image, Remy.
- I am dead!
- Can you guys shut up?
I've got to think! Word's getting out.
If I can't keep them quiet,
the entire clan's gonna be after me
with their mouths open and...
Here it is.
Hey. Your will!
- Oh, this is interesting. Mind if I...
- Not at all.
Linguini?
Why would Linguini be filed
with your will?
This used to be my office.
He's your son?
- I have a son?
- How could you not know this?
I am a figment of your imagination.
You did not know, how could I?
Well, your son is the rightful owner
of this restaurant!
Well, your son is the rightful owner
of this restaurant!
No! No! The rat!
- Sorry, chef.
- The rat! It's stolen my documents!
- It's getting away!
Hey, Mr. Chef!
You!
- Get out of my office.
- He's not in your office. You are in his.
Bottoms up, Linguini!
Cheers, ja.
Chef! Chef!
Chef Linguini!
Your rise has been meteoric,
yet you have no formal training.
What is the secret to your genius?
LINGUINl: Secret? You want the truth?
I am Gusteau's son.
It's in my blood I guess.
But you weren't
aware of that fact until very recently.
No.
And it resulted in
your taking ownership of this restaurant.
How did you find out?
Well, some part of me just knew.
The Gusteau part?
- Where do you get your inspiration?
- Inspiration has many names.
- Mine is named Colette.
- What?
Something's stuck in my teeth.
Health Inspector.
I wish to report a rat infestation.
It's taken over my...
Gusteau's restaurant.
Gusteau's, eh?
I can drop by. Let's see.
First opening is three months.
It must happen now!
It's a gourmet restaurant!
Monsieur, I have the information.
If someone cancels, I'll slot you in.
But the rat!
You must...
It stole my documents.
It's past opening time.
He should have
finished an hour ago.
Bonjour, ma chrie.
Join us.
We were just talking
about my inspiration.
Yes, he calls it his tiny chef.
Not that, dearest. I meant you.
- It's him.
- Ego?
Anton Ego!
Is that Ego?
I can't believe it.
- You are Monsieur Linguini?
- Hello.
Pardon me for interrupting
your premature celebration,
but I thought it only fair
to give you a sporting chance
as you are new to this game.
- Game?
- Yes.
And you've been playing
without an opponent.
Which is, as you may have guessed,
against the rules.
You're Anton Ego.
You're slow
for someone in the fast lane.
And you're thin
for someone who likes food.
I don't like food. I love it.
If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
I will return tomorrow night
with high expectations.
Pray you don't disappoint me.
Listen, we hate to be rude,
but we're French, and it's dinnertime.
She meant to say,
"It's dinnertime and we're French."
Don't give me that look.
You were distracting me
in front of the press.
How am I supposed to concentrate with
you yanking on my hair all the time?
And that's another thing.
Your opinion isn't the only one
that matters here.
Colette knows how to cook, too,
you know.
All right, that's it!
You take a break, Little Chef.
I'm not your puppet,
and you're not
my puppet-controlling guy!
The rat is the cook.
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.
Ego is coming, and I need to focus!
You stupid...
Wow. I have never seen that before.
Yeah, it's like you're his fluffy bunny
or something.
I'm sorry, Remy.
I know there are too many guys.
- I tried to limit...
- You know what?
It's okay. I've been selfish.
- You guys hungry?
- Are you kidding?
All right. Dinner's on me.
We'll go after closing time.
- In fact...
- Yeah.
...tell Dad to bring the whole clan.
Little Chef?
This is great, Son.
An inside job. I see the appeal.
Oof!
Little Chef?
Little Chef?
Hey, Little Chef.
I thought you went back
to the apartment.
Then when you weren't there,
I don't know...
It didn't seem right to leave things
the way that we did, so...
Look, I don't want to fight.
I've been under a lot of, you know,
pressure.
A lot has changed
in not very much time, you know?
I'm suddenly a Gusteau.
And I got to be a Gusteau or, you know,
people will be disappointed.
It's weird.
You know, I've never
disappointed anyone before,
because nobody's
ever expected anything of me.
And the only reason
anyone expects anything from me now
is because of you.
I haven't been fair to you.
You've never failed me,
and I should never forget that.
You've been a good friend.
The most honorable friend
a guy could ever ask...
What is this?
What's going on?
What...
Hey...
You're...
You're stealing food? How could you?
I thought you were my friend!
I trusted you!
Get out! You and all your rat buddies!
And don't come back
or I'll treat you the way restaurants
are supposed to treat pests!
You're right, Dad. Who am I kidding?
We are what we are, and we're rats.
Well, he'll leave soon,
and now you know how to get in.
Steal all you want.
- You're not coming?
- I've lost my appetite.
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?
Yes,
I'd like your heart roasted on a spit.
Come in!
Today's the big day.
You should say something to them.
- Like what?
- You are the boss. Inspire them.
Attention.
Attention, everyone.
Tonight is a big night.
Appetite is coming,
and he's going to have a big ego.
I mean, Ego. He's coming. The critic.
And he's going to order something.
Something from our menu.
And we'll have to cook it,
unless he orders something cold.
Just can't leave it alone,
can you?
You really shouldn't be here
during restaurant hours. It's not safe.
I'm hungry!
And I don't need the inside food
to be happy.
The key, my friend, is to not be picky.
- Observe.
- No, wait!
- Oh, no! No, no! What do we do?
- I'll go get Dad.
You might think you are a chef
but you are still only a rat.
Sure he took away a star
last time he reviewed this place.
Sure it probably killed... Dad.
- This is very bad juju right here.
- But I'll tell you one thing...
- Ego is here.
- Ego? He is here?
Anton Ego is just another customer.
Let's cook!
Yeah! Let's...
Okay.
So I have in mind
a simple arrangement.
You will create for me a new line
of Chef Skinner frozen foods.
And I, in return, will not kill you.
Au revoir, rat!
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?
Yes, I think I do.
After reading a lot of overheated
puffery about your new cook,
you know what I'm craving?
A little perspective.
That's it. I'd like some fresh, clear,
well seasoned perspective.
Can you suggest
a good wine to go with that?
- With what, sir?
- Perspective. Fresh out, I take it?
I am...
Very well.
Since you're all out of perspective
and no one else
seems to have it in this bloody town,
I'll make you a deal.
You provide the food,
I'll provide the perspective.
Which would go nicely
with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947.
I'm afraid I...
Your dinner selection?
Tell your Chef Linguini that I want
whatever he dares to serve me.
Tell him to hit me with his best shot.
I will have whatever he is having.
- So, we have given up.
- Why do you say that?
We are in a cage inside the car trunk
awaiting a future
in frozen food products.
No, I'm the one in a cage. I've given up.
You are free.
I am only as free
as you imagine me to be.
As you are.
Oh, please. I'm sick of pretending.
I pretend to be a rat for my father.
I pretend to be a human
through Linguini.
I pretend you exist
so I have someone to talk to!
You only tell me stuff I already know!
I know who I am!
Why do I need you to tell me?
Why do I need to pretend?
But you don't, Remy.
You never did.
No. My other left!
Dad? Dad, I'm in here!
I'm inside the trunk! What the...
Dad!
- Hey, little brother!
- Emile!
I love you guys!
Where are you going?
Back to the restaurant.
They'll fail without me.
- Why do you care?
- Because I'm a cook!
It's your recipe.
How can you not know
your own recipe?
I didn't write it down. It just came to me.
Then make it come to you again, ja?
Because we can't serve this!
Where's my order?
Can't we serve something else?
Something I didn't invent?
This is what they're ordering.
Make them order something else.
Tell them we're all out.
We cannot be all out. We just opened.
I have another idea.
What if we serve them what they order!
We will make it.
Just tell us what you did.
I don't know what I did.
We need to tell
the customers something.
Then tell them... Tell them...
Huh?
- Don't do it.
- Remy. Remy.
Don't! Stop!
They'll see you. Stop.
We're not talking about me.
We're talking about what to do right...
Rats!
- Remy!
- Get my knife.
Don't touch him!
Thanks for coming back, Little Chef.
I know this sounds insane, but...
Well,
the truth sounds insane sometimes.
But that doesn't mean it's not
the truth.
And the truth is, I have no talent at all.
But this rat,
he's the one behind these recipes.
He's the cook. The real cook.
He's been hiding under my toque.
He's been controlling my actions.
He's the reason I can cook the food
that's exciting everyone.
The reason Ego is outside that door.
You've been giving me credit
for his gift.
I know it's a hard thing to believe.
But, hey, you believed I could cook,
right?
Look, this works.
It's crazy, but it works.
We can be
the greatest restaurant in Paris,
and this rat, this brilliant Little Chef,
can lead us there.
What do you say? You with me?
Dad.
Dad, I don't know what to say.
I was wrong about your friend
and about you.
I don't want you to think
I'm choosing this over family.
I can't choose
between two halves of myself.
I'm not talking about cooking.
I'm talking about guts.
This really means that much to you?
We're not cooks, but we are family.
You tell us what to do,
and we'll get it done.
- Stop that health inspector!
- Delta Team, go, go, go, go!
The rest of you stay and help Remy.
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.
Team five, grill. Team six, sauces.
Get to your stations. Let's go, go, go!
Those handling food
will walk on two legs.
We need someone to wait tables.
I'm sorry for any delay,
but we're a little short tonight.
Please, take all of the time you need.
He came in late one more time
and all of a sudden he...
Make sure that steak
is nice and tenderized.
Work it. Yeah. Stick and move.
Stick and move.
Easy with that sole meunire.
Less salt. More butter.
Only use the mimolette cheese.
Whoa! Compose the salad
like you were painting a picture.
Not too much vinaigrette
on that salade compose.
Don't let that beurre blanc separate.
Keep whisking.
Gently poach the scallops.
Taste check. Spoons down.
Good. Too much salt. Good.
Don't boil the consomm,
it'll toughen the pheasant. Emile!
Sorry.
Colette, wait! Colette.
- You came back. Colette...
- Don't say a word.
If I think about it,
I might change my mind.
Just tell me what the rat wants to cook.
Ratatouille? It's a peasant dish.
Are you sure
you want to serve this to Ego?
What? I am making ratatouille.
Well, how would you prepare it?
Ratatouille? They must be joking.
Mmm.
No, it can't be.
Who cooked the ratatouille?
I demand to know!
I can't remember the last time
I asked a waiter
to give my compliments to the chef.
And now I find myself
in the extraordinary position
of having my waiter be the chef.
Thanks, but I'm just your waiter tonight.
Then who do I thank for the meal?
Excuse me a minute.
You must be the chef...
If you wish to meet the chef,
you will have to wait
until all the other customer have gone.
So be it.
At first, Ego thinks it's a joke.
But as Linguini explains,
Ego's smile disappears.
He doesn't react
beyond asking an occasional question.
And when the story is done,
Ego stands, thanks us for the meal...
Thank you for the meal.
... and leaves without another word.
The following day his review appears.
In many ways,
the work of a critic is easy.
We risk very little,
yet enjoy a position over those
who offer up their work
and their selves to our judgment.
We thrive on negative criticism,
which is fun to write and to read.
But the bitter truth we critics must face
is that in the grand scheme of things,
the average piece of junk
is probably more meaningful
than our criticism designating it so.
But there are times
when a critic truly risks something
and that is in the discovery
and defense of the new.
The world is often unkind
to new talent, new creations.
The new needs friends.
Last night,
I experienced something new,
an extraordinary meal
from a singularly unexpected source.
To say that both the meal
and its maker
have challenged my preconceptions
about fine cooking
is a gross understatement.
They have rocked me to my core.
In the past, I have made no secret
of my disdain
for Chef Gusteau's famous motto,
"Anyone can cook."
But I realize only now
do I truly understand what he meant.
Not everyone
can become a great artist,
but a great artist
can come from anywhere.
It is difficult to imagine
more humble origins
than those of the genius
now cooking at Gusteau's,
who is, in this critic's opinion,
nothing less
than the finest chef in France.
I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
hungry for more.
I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,
hungry for more.
It was a great night.
The happiest of my life.
But the only thing predictable
about life is its unpredictability.
Well, we had to let Skinner
and the health inspector loose,
and of course they ratted us out.
The food didn't matter.
Once it got out
there were rats in the kitchen,
oh, man, the restaurant was closed
and Ego lost his job and his credibility.
But don't feel too bad for him.
He's doing very well
as a small business investor.
- He seems very happy.
- How do you know?
Got to go. Dinner rush.
You know how he likes it.
Thanks, Little Chef.
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?
- Don't you always?
- Which one would you like?
Surprise me.
Can I interest you
in a dessert this evening?
Hey, believe me, that story
gets better when I tell it, okay?
Come on. Bring some food over here,
we're starving!
(mysterious music playing)
(electronic surge thumps)
(steady beeping)
(clank)
(rumbling)
(whooshing)
(clank)
(electronic beeping)
(crowd murmuring)
(electric surge thumps)
(footsteps thudding)
(ominous music playing)
(female voice):
Read the charges.
Dr. Jumba Jookiba...
lead scientist of
Galaxy Defense Industries...
you stand before this council
accused of illegal
genetic experimentation.
(electronic whirring)
(thud)
GRAND COUNCIL WOMAN:
How do you plead?
Not guilty!
My experiments
are only theoretical...
completely
within legal boundaries.
We believe you actually
created something.
Created something?! Ha!
But that would be irresponsible
and unethical.
I would never, ever...
(whooshes softly)
...make more than one.
(growling and snarling)
(clanks)
(all gasping)
What is that monstrosity?
Monstrosity!
What you see before you
is the first of a new species.
I call it Experiment 6-2-6.
(snarling)
JUMBA:
He is bulletproof, fireproof
and can think faster
than supercomputer.
He can see in the dark
and move objects
His only instinct:
To destroy
everything he touches!
(laughing maniacally)
So, it is a monster.
Hey, just a little one.
It is an affront to nature.
It must be destroyed!
Calm yourself, Captain Gantu.
Perhaps it can be reasoned with.
Experiment 6-2-6
give us some sign you understand
any of this.
Show us that there is something
inside you that is good.
(clearing throat)
ALL:
Hmm?
Meega, nala kweesta!
(horrified gasps)
(retching)
So naughty!
(cackling sinisterly)
I didn't teach it that.
Place that idiot scientist
under arrest!
I prefer to be called
"evil genius"!
And as for that abomination...
(slurping)
...it is the flawed product
of a deranged mind.
(glass squeaking)
It has no place among us.
Captain Gantu, take him away.
With pleasure.
(knuckles cracking)
(muttering)
(clanking)
(snarling)
(squeaks)
(jabbering)
(yelps)
Hmm.
(gurgling)
(clanking and whirring)
(snorting)
Uncomfortable?
Oh...
Good!
The council has banished you
to exile on a desert asteroid.
So, relax... enjoy the trip
and don't get any ideas.
These guns are locked
onto your genetic signature.
They won't shoot anyone but you.
(ferocious snarl)
Ow! Why, you!
(clearing throat)
May I remind the captain
that he is on duty.
(pistol squeaks and pops)
Secure the cell!
Aye, Captain.
(whirs and thuds)
(hatch whirs shut)
FEMALE OFFICER:
Captain on deck.
All ahead full.
(seat cushion hisses)
(controls beeping)
Do... Does this, uh,
look infected to you?
(engine whooshing)
(dramatic music plays)
(guns whirring)
(clicking and whirring)
Oh!
(throaty gurgling)
(high-pitched squeal)
(gurgling and whirring
continue)
Quiet, you.
(growling and snorting)
Gunfire in the cell bay!
Open a channel.
(teeth chattering)
(chuckling)
(whimpering)
(guns zapping)
(alarm buzzing)
He's loose on Deck C!
Red alert.
Seal off the deck!
(yelps, grunts)
(whimpering)
(grunting)
Security,
converge on door seven!
(Gantu over intercom):
Deadly force authorized.
Fire on sight!
There he is!
(squealing)
Security to Bridge.
It's in the ventilation system.
(footsteps clicking)
He's headed for the power...
(engines whining)
...grid.
(loud thud, whooshing)
What was that?
I don't think he's
on the ship anymore.
Confirmed.
He's taken a police cruiser.
(alarm beeping)
Yeah... he took the red one.
(horn honking)
Yee-haw!
(weapon fire crackling)
(yelling)
(weapons zapping)
(whooshing)
(grunts)
(engines whining)
Hmm?!
PILOT:
That's it!
We got it.
We got it!
(shouting and laughing)
COMPUTERVOICE:
Hyperdrive activated.
System charging.
He's engaged his H-drive!
COMPUTER:
Warning...
guidance is not functional.
Pursuit Commander
that crazy trog is
about to make a jump!
COMMANDER:
Break formation!
Get clear of that ship!
Navigation failure.
Do not engage hyper...
(thunderous explosion)
(electrical crackling)
(pounds chair)
(frustrated sigh)
Get me Galactic Control.
(door whooshes)
Where is he?!
He's still in hyperspace.
Where will he exit?
Calculating now...
quadrant 17, section 0-0-5,
area 51.
A planet called... Ee-arth.
I want an expert on this planet
in here now!
(monitor beeping)
What is that?
Water. Most of the planet
is covered in it.
He won't survive in water.
His molecular density
is too great.
(relieved sighs)
(beeping continues)
No...
(bell dinging)
(clamoring)
Of course.
How much time do we have?
We have projected his landing
at three hours, 42 minutes.
Oh, we have to gas the planet.
Hold it!
Hold everything!
Earth is a protected
wildlife preserve.
Yeah. We've been using it
to rebuild
the mosquito population
which, need I remind you,
is an endangered species!
Am I to assume
you are the expert?
(laughing modestly):
Oh, I don't know about "expert."
(clears throat)
Agent Pleakley at your service.
Can we not simply
destroy the island?
No! Crazyhead!
The mosquito's food of choice,
primitive humanoid life forms
have colonies
all over that planet.
Are they intelligent?
No, but they're very delicate.
In fact, every time an asteroid
strikes their planet
they have to begin life
all over.
(sighs)
It's fascinating, isn't it?
With this,
I've been able to study...
What if our military forces
just landed there?
Well, that'd be a bad idea!
These are extremely
simple creatures, miss.
Landing there would create mass
mayhem and planet-wide panic!
A quiet capture would require
an understanding of 6-2-6
that we do not possess!
Who, then, Mr. Pleakley, would
you send for his extraction?
Does he have a brother?
Close grandmother, perhaps?
(angry shouting)
(insane jabbering)
Friendly cousin?
Neighbor with a beard?
(inmates chanting furiously)
(whirring)
(electrical humming)
(enraged roaring)
(gobbling)
(sniffles)
(Jumba murmuring)
(laughing sinisterly)
He got away?
I'm sure this comes
as no surprise to you.
I designed this creature
for to be unstoppable.
Which is precisely why you
must now bring him back.
What? Me?
And to reward you
we are willing to trade
your freedom for his capture.
(sighs)
Maybe direct hit
from plasma cannon
might stun him long enough to...
Plasma cannon granted.
Do we have a bargain, Dr. Jumba?
(grunts)
B-B-But it's a delicate planet!
(singsong):
Who's going to control him?
You will.
Very good, Your Highness.
I... I didn't quite...
(door slams shut)
Uh, you're not joking!
So, tell me,
my little one-eyed one
on what poor, pitiful,
defenseless planet
has my monstrosity
been unleashed?

INSTRUCTOR:
Stop. Stop.
Lilo, why are you all wet?
It's sandwich day.
(sighing)
Every Thursday,
I take Pudge the fish
a peanut butter sandwich.
Pudge is a fish?
And today we were out
of peanut butter!
So I asked my sister
what to give him
and she said a tuna sandwich.
I can't give Pudge tuna!
(whispering):
Do you know what tuna is?
Fish?
It's fish!
If I gave Pudge tuna,
I'd be an abomination!
I'm late because
I had to go to the store
and get peanut butter
'cause all we have
is-is stinkin' tuna!
Lilo, Lilo, why is
this so important?
Pudge controls the weather.
You're crazy.
(Lilo shrieking)
(all screaming)
Please! Please!
Everybody calm down!
(crying)
Girls...
(speaking Hawaiian)
Shh.
Lilo...
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I won't do it again!
Maybe we should call
your sister.
No! I'll be good!
I want to dance.
I practiced.
I just want to dance.
I practiced.
Ooh, she bit me.
GIRLS:
Eww!
(all cheering)
(girls laughing and shouting)
I called your sister.
She said to wait for her
here on the porch.
We'll try again on Sunday.
(children shouting playfully
in distance)
Does this look infected
to you?
Yeah.
(girls gasping)
You better not have rabies.
If you have rabies
the dogcatcher is
going to have to cut...
Are you going to play dolls?
You don't have a doll.
This is Scrump.
(all gasping)
I made her,
but her head is too big.
So I pretend a bug laid eggs
in her ears, and she's upset
because she only has
a few more days to...
(soft, sad music playing)
##
Lilo!
Lilo?
Lilo?
Oh, no.
(grunts)
You better be home.
(dog barking)
(engine purring)
(brakes screech)
Hey! Watch where you're going!
Stupidhead!
(panting)
(Elvis Presley's
"Heartbreak Hotel" playing)
# I found a new place
to dwell... #
Oh, Lilo!
Lilo! Open the door, Lilo!
LILO:
Go away.
#... You make me so lonely,
baby... #
Lilo?
We don't have time for this.
#... I get so lonely... #
Leave me alone to die.
Come on, Lilo
that social worker's going
to be here any minute!
#... You still can find... #
(volume increases):
#... some room... #
(growling)
# For brokenhearted lovers
to cry away their gloom #
(frustrated groan)
# Don't make me so lonely #
# I get so lonely
I could die... #
(engine turns off)
(wood creaking)
(grunts)
# The bellhop's tears
keep flowin'... #
You are so finished
when I get in there!
(mouthing song):
# Well, they been so long
on Lonely Street #
# They ain't ever
gonna look back... #
Oh, I'm going to stuff you
in the blender
push "puree,"
then bake you into a pie
and feed it
to the social worker!
And when he says,
"Mmm, this is great.
What's your secret?"
I'm going to say...
(gasps)
"Love... and nurturing."
Hi. Uh...
(hammer clunks)
You must be the, uh...
The stupidhead.
Oh! Oh...
Oh, you know,
I'm really sorry about that
and if I'd known who you were,
of course I never would've...
Uh... I can pay for that.
It's a rental.
Are you the guardian
in question?
Yes. I'm Nani.
Nice to meet you, Mister?
Bubbles.
Mr. Bubbles.
That's a strange...
Yes, I know.
Are you going
to invite me in, Nani?
Uh... I thought we could
sit out here and talk.
I don't think so.
(quietly):
Right. Uh...
(from inside):
#... It's always crowded... #
This way.
#... You still can find
some room #
# For brokenhearted lovers
to cry away their gloom #
# You make me so lonely,
baby... #
Uh... wait here.
(clattering)
(glass breaking, crashing)
(record scratches,
music stops)
LILO:
Hey!
(clunking)
(panting):
So...
lemonade?
Do you often
leave your sister home alone?
No. Never.
(Nani shrieks)
Well, except for just now.
Uh, I had to run
to the store to get some...
(steam whistling)
Oh!
You left the stove on
while you were out?
Low heat!
Just a simmer.
Mmm!
It's coming along great.
(loud whoosh, yells)
I found that this morning.
Lilo! There you are.
Honeyface...
this is Mr. Bubbles.
Nice to meet you.
Your knuckles say "Cobra."
(cracking)
Cobra Bubbles.
You don't look like
a social worker.
I'm a special classification.
Did you ever kill anyone?
We're getting off the subject.
Let's talk about you.
Are you happy?
(no audio)
I'm adjusted.
I eat four food groups
and look both ways
before crossing the street
and take long naps,
and get disciplined.
(muffled gasp)
Disciplined?
Yeah.
She disciplines me real good.
Sometimes five times a day.
- With bricks.
- No...
Bricks?
Uh-huh, in a pillowcase.
Okay! That's enough sugar
for you.
Why don't you run along,
you little cutie.
(nervous giggle)
The other social workers
just thought she was a scream.
Thirsty?
Let me illuminate to you
the precarious situation
in which you have
found yourself.
I am the one they call
when things go wrong
and things have
indeed gone wrong.
(spoons clinking)
(rattling)
My friends need to be punished.
(groans)
Call me next time
you're left here alone.
Yep.
In case you're wondering,
this did not go well.
(nails clattering)
You have three days
to change my mind.
(shrieking)
(shrieking continues)
- Blah.
- Eww!
Lilo!
(boots screech)
(hinges creak/door shuts)
(slams)
(hinges creaks)
(Lilo growls)
(snarling and growling)
(hisses)
Why didn't you wait
at the school?
You were supposed
to wait there!
- Lilo!
(grunting)
Do you not understand?
Do you want to be taken away?
Answer me!
No!
No, you don't understand?
No!
No, what?
No!
(grunts)
(muffled whining)
(frustrated grunt)
You're such a pain!
So why don't you sell me
and buy a rabbit instead?!
At least a rabbit would behave
better than you!
Go ahead!
Then you'll be happy
because it'll be smarter
than me, too!
And quieter!
You'll like it,
'cause it's stinky, like you!
(slams)
Go to your room!
I'm already in my room!
(slams)
(muffled screaming)
(dog barks in distance)
(softly):
Hey.
I brought you some pizza,
in case you were hungry.
We're a broken family,
aren't we?
No.
Maybe, a little.
Maybe a lot.
I shouldn't have yelled at you.
We're sisters. It's our job.
Yeah, well, from now on...
I like you better as a sister
than a mom.
Yeah?
And you like me better
as a sister
than a rabbit, right?
(sniffling)
(gently):
Oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
(sniffles)
I hit Mertle Edmonds today.
You hit her?
Before I bit her.
You bit her.
Lilo, you shouldn't...
People treat me different.
They just don't know
what to say.
I'll tell you what.
If you promise
not to fight anymore
I promise not to yell at you,
except on special occasions.
Tuesdays and bank
holidays would be good.
Yeah? Would that be good?
(both giggling)
Oh! My camera's full again.
(whispering):
Aren't they beautiful?
(low rumbling)
(electrical crackling)
(rumbling continuing)
(thundering whoosh)
A falling star!
(car alarms blaring
in distance)
(whooshing)
(explosive thud)
I call it! Get out! Get out!
I have to make a wish!
Can't you go any faster?
Oh, no!
Gravity is increasing on me.
No, it's not!
It is, too, Lilo.
The same thing
happened yesterday.
You rotten sister!
Your butt is crushing me!
Why do you act so weird?!
(slams)
(quietly):
It's me again.
I need someone
to be my friend...
someone who won't run away.
Maybe send me an angel...
the nicest angel you have.

NANI:
We're looking for something
that can defend itself...
something that won't die...
something sturdy, you know?
Like a lobster.
Lilo, you lolo.
Do we have a lobster door?
No. We have a dog door.
We are getting a dog.
(frantic grunting)
(Jumba laughs in distance)
JUMBA:
So nice
to see your pretty face again!
Jumba?
We need your name and address
at the bottom of the form...
The kennel's back this way.
Go. Pick someone out.
(echoing):
Hello?
(echoing):
Hello?!
(thumping)
Are there any "aminals" in here?
(panting and whining)
(sniffing)
LILO:
Hello!
Hi.
Hoh... ha...
Hi...
Wow!
Oh, yes. Mm-hmm.
All of our dogs are adoptable.
Except that one!
What is that thing?!
A dog, I think.
But it was dead this morning.
It was dead this morning?!
Well, we thought it was dead.
It was hit by a truck.
I like him!
Come here, boy.
(straining growl)
Oh! Aah!
(grunts)
Wouldn't you like
a different dog?
We have better dogs, dear.
Not better than him.
He can talk! Say hello.
He... Hel...
Dogs can't talk, dear.
LILO:
He did.
Does it have to be this dog?
(panting)
(grunting)
(smacking)
Yes, he's good.
I can tell.
WOMAN:
You'll have to think of a name
for him.
His name is... Stitch.
Now, that's not a real name...
Hmm. Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh.
...in Iceland...
but here, it's a good name.
Stitch it is.
And there's
a two dollar license fee.
I want to buy him!
(whispering):
Can I borrow two dollars?
He's all yours.
JUMBA:
You're all mine.
PLEAKLEY:
Well, what's he doing?
Shh! Keep quiet.
He's listening for us.
(whispering):
How good is his hearing?
I mean, can he...
(grunts)
(choking)
(laser hums)
Why don't you run?
(barking)
Coming! I'm coming!
Stop!
I have just determined
this situation
to be far too hazardous!
Don't worry,
I won't hit her.
No! That girl is a part
of the mosquito food chain.
Here! Educate yourself.
Using a little girl
for a shield.
This is low, even for you!
(tauntingly):
Whoo-hoo!
- Bah!
(yells)
Tear him apart
with all both my bare hands!
Have you lost your mind?!
(barking)
- What is it, Stitch?
We cannot be seen!
(barking)
Bad dog, barking at nothing!
(muttering)
You can't shoot,
and you can't be seen.
Look at you!
(whispering):
You look like a monster.
We have to blend in.
NANI:
Okay, I got to get to work.
Stick around town and stay
out of the roads, okay?
I'll meet you at 1:00.
Hmm?
Oh!
Ah!
(chuckling)
(growling and snarling)
NANI:
Okay, I guess
we should be going.
(giggles)
(raspberry kiss)
What about Stitch?
(disgusted grunt)
(bicycle bell chimes)
(growls)
(gasps)
My friends!
(gasping and shrieking)
(all panting)
What do you want?
I'm sorry I bit you
and pulled your hair
and punched you in the face.
Apology not accepted.
Now get out of my way
before I run you over.
(shrieks)
I got a new dog.
His name is Stitch.
That is the ugliest thing
I have ever saw.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Eww! Get it away from me!
I'm gonna get a disease!
(Stitch gasps)
(shrieks)
(crying)
Somebody do something!
Oh, great! He's loose.
His destructive programming
is taking effect.
He will be irresistibly
drawn to large cities
where he will back up sewers
reverse street signs and
steal everyone's left shoe.
(snarling)
(frustrated grunting)
It's nice to live on an island
with no large cities.
(gasps)
(babbling)
Are you okay?

This is you.
This is your badness level.
It's unusually high
for someone your size.
We have to fix that.
Ay-yi-yi, Lilo!
Your dog cannot sit
at the table.
Stitch is troubled.
He needs desserts.
Oh, you didn't even eat
your sweet potato.
I thought you liked them.
Desserts!
(sighs)
(people laughing and chatting)
LILO:
David!
I got a new dog.
Oh! You sure it's a dog?
Uh-huh.
He used to be a collie
before he got ran over.
Yum!
(gobbling)
Hey...
Blah!
Eww!
Howzit, Nani?
Did you catch fire again?
Nah, just the stage.
Listen, I was wondering
if you're not
doing anything this...
David, I told you, I can't. I...
I got a lot to deal with
right now.
I know. I just figured
you might need some time...
You smell like a lawn mower.
(exhales and sniffs)
Look, I got to go.
The kid at table three's
throwing poi again.
Maybe some other time, okay?
LILO:
Don't worry.
She likes your butt
and fancy hair.
I know. I read her diary.
She thinks it's fancy?
(grumbling)
Blech!

Oh! Mmm!
Aha! Look what I find!
Get restraints!
Right.
Ow! Take that! Hurry!

Hey, Nani!
Is that your dog?
Uh...
(Pleakley with woman's voice):
All is well.
Please, go about your business.
I'm okay.
Oh, your head looks swollen.
Actually, shes just ugly.
(nervous laughter):
Darling...
Hes joking.
Ugly... look at me...
Uh, this is not working out.
Uh, b-but...
Mm-mm.
Yeah?
Well, who wants to work
at this stupid...
fakey luau anyway.
Come on, Lilo.
(crickets chirping)
(owl hooting)
Did you lose your job
because of Stitch and me?
Nah. The manager's a vampire
and he wanted me to join
his legion of the undead.
I knew it.
This is a great home.
You'll like it a lot.
(hisses)
See?
Uh, Lilo...
Comfy.
(growls)
(grunts)
- Hey!
- Hey!
What is the matter with you?
Be careful of the little angel!
It's not an angel, Lilo.
I don't even think it's a dog.
We just have to take him back.
Hes just cranky
because it's his bedtime.
NANI:
He's creepy, Lilo.
I won't sleep
while he's loose in the house.
LILO:
You're loose in the house
all the time
and I sleep just fine!
Hey, what are you doing?
- Stop that, Stitch!
(growls)
Hey!
(growling and grunting)
Look at him, Lilo.
He's obviously mutated
from something else.
We have to take him back.
He was an orphan
and we adopted him!
What about "O'hana"?
He hasn't been here that long.
Neither have I.
Dad said O'hana means family.
Huh?
O'hana means family.
Family means...
BOTH:
...nobody gets left behind.
Or?
Or forgotten.
I know. I know.
I hate it
when you use O'hana against me.
Mmm.
(grunts)
(giggles)
Don't worry, you can sleep
right next to me.
(groans)
(exhausted sigh)
(growls)
(sniffing)
Look how curious the puppy is.
This is my room,
and this is your bed.
(grunts)
This is your dolly and bottle.
See? Doesn't spill.
I filled it with coffee.
Good puppy. Now get into bed.
(growls)
Hey!
That's mine!
Down!
(grunts)
- Mmm!
Be careful of that!
You don't touch this!
Don't ever touch it!
(growls)
(Stitch muttering
in alien language)
(cloth tearing)
No! Don't pull on her head!
She's recovering from surgery.
(growls)
No! That's from my blue period.
(growling)
(gulps)
Mmm...
- There.
(purring)
You know, you wreck
everything you touch.
Why not try and make something
for a change?
(purrs and grunts)
(Stitch humming)
(muttering)
Ah!
Wow. San Francisco.
(humming)
(roaring)
(growling)
(in high voice):
Save me!
(growling)
Eek!
(chomping)
No more caffeine for you.
(laughing)
This little girl is wasting
her time.
its destructive programming.
(laughing)
Ooh!
(laughing):
Push that over.
(laughing)
What are you doing?
Nothing!
Uh, say, I want to try it on.
No!
Share! Let me try it!
Hey! Ow! You're just jealous
'cause I'm pretty!
(gasps):
Don't move.
A mosquito has chosen me
as her perch.
She's so beautiful.
(buzzing)
Look, another one.
And another one!
Why, it's a whole flock.
And they like me!
They're nuzzling my flesh
with their noses.
Now they're, um, they're...
(Pleakley screaming painfully)
NANI:
I think it might be a koala.
An evil koala.
I can't even pet it.
It keeps staring at me,
like it's going to eat me.
(gasps)
(David over phone):
Hello?
Nani?
Hello?
Are you there?
(gulping)
(burps)
JUMBA:
Now, this is interesting.
PLEAKLEY:
What?
to be a monster
but now he has nothing
to destroy.
You see, I never gave him
a greater purpose.
What must it be like
to have nothing...
not even memories to visit
in the middle of the night?
Nah!
(sputters)
Hmm.
Hmm...
(growls and grunts)
(groaning)
(grunting)
(grunting)
(grunting continues)
(grunting)
(yawns)
That's the Ugly Duckling.
See? He's sad
because he's all alone
and nobody wants him
but on this page,
his family hears him crying
and they find him.
Then the Ugly Duckling is happy
because he knows
where he belongs.
Hmm...
(growls and grunts)

Want to listen to the King?
You look like an Elvis fan.

Well, uh, actually,
I just quit that job
because, you know,
the hours are just not conducive
to the challenges
of raising a child...
(snarling)
(grunts)
Hey!
(gasps)
I am so sorry about that.
What is that thing?
That's my puppy.
Really?
(cracking neck)
Thus far, you have been adrift
in the sheltered harbor
of my patience
but I cannot ignore
you being jobless.
Do I make myself clear?
Perfectly.
And next time I see this dog
I expect it to be
a model citizen... capisce?
Uh... yes?
New job.
Model citizen.
(plinks and clatters)
Good day.

I'm here to answer
your newspaper ad.
Elvis Presley was
a model citizen.

I've compiled a list
of his traits
for you to practice.
Number one is dancing.
I can't talk now, dear.
I'm waiting for someone
to answer my ad.
That's why I'm here.
Hands on your hips.
Now follow my lead.

Why is everything so dark?
I am all about coffee.
Let's move on to step two.

Oh, we might have something.
Good. Now kiss her.

I'm sure Elvis had
his bad days, too.

Actually, I do think
we have an opening.

Okay, this is it.

We've been having a bad day.

Hmm...
Hey, I might not be a doctor

no better cure for a sour face
than a couple of boards
and some choice waves.
What you think?
I think that's a great idea.

Wait...
something is not right.

Oh, hold on, Mom...

(beeps, Pleakley yelps)
Mr. Pleakley, you are overdue.
I want a status report.
Oh, uh, things are going well.
He cannot swim!
Things are going well.
Jumba, aren't they going well?
Why will he risk drowning?
Jumba?
Jumba, help me out here.
I would have expected you back
by now, with 6-2-6 in hand.
Just a few things left to pack
and, uh, we'll be...
Hang up.
(beeps)
We are going swimming.
Huh?

Lilo!
(gasps)
What happened?
Oh... some lolo must have
stuffed us in the barrel.
Where's Stitch?
(gasping)
(yelling)
Get off of her!
What happened?
Stitch dragged her down.
(gurgling)
(all gasping)
We lost Stitch!

Look at me, baby.
Are you hurt?
No.

He's unconscious,
but I think he's alive.
(choking and coughing)
(growling)
(snarling)
David, take Lilo.
This isn't what it looks like.
We were...
It-Its just that...
I know you're trying, Nani
but you need to think
about what's best for Lilo...
even if it removes you
from the picture.
I'll be back tomorrow morning
for Lilo.
I'm sorry.
(melancholy melody plays)
Nani? Is there something
I can do?
No, David.
Uh, I need
to take Lilo home now.
We have a lot to talk about,
Lilo.
Thanks.

You know, I really believed
they had a chance.
Then you came along.

(crickets chirping)

Lilo, honey...
we have to, uh...
Don't worry.
You're nice, and someone

I would.

Come here.

LILO:
That's us before...
It was rainy,
and they went for a drive.
What happened to yours?
I hear you cry at night.
Do you dream about them?
I know that's
why you wreck things
and push me.
Our family's little now
and we don't have many toys
but if you want,
you could be part of it.
You could be our baby
and we'd raise you to be good.
"O'hana" means family.
"Family" means nobody gets
left behind
but if you want to leave,
you can.
I'll remember you, though.
I remember everyone that leaves.

I... I...
Lost.
I'm lost.

PLEAKLEY:
Help!
I don't like the ocean!
(whimpers)
(screams)
Oh, look,
a friendly little dolphin.
(coughs)
They helped sailors
in the war...
It's a shark!
It's a shark,
and it ain't friendly!
It looks like a dolphin.
Tricky fish! Tricky fish!
Oh, octopus, come and help me?
An octo... octopus is worse
than a shark!
I hate this planet!

(waves crashing)
(gasping)
JUMBA:
Oh...
little monster!
(communicator ringing)
(beeps)
Uh, Agent Pleakley here.
I have lost patience
with you both.
Have you captured 6-2-6 or not?
Um...
Uh-uh...
Consider yourselves fired
and prisonbound.
Your incompetence is nothing
short of unspeakable!
(beeps off)
But, uh...mm...
(sobbing)
We're fired!
Now we do it my way!
Your way?
(sniffles)
Oh... uh, wait!
It seems I have overestimated
Jumber and Blinkley.
Uh, Jumba and Pleakley.
Whatever. The mission
is in jeopardy.
This could be your chance to
redeem yourself, Captain Gantu.
How soon will you be prepared
to leave?
Immediately.
(moaning)
(leaves rustling)
(gasps)
(gasps)
(chuckling)
Don't run.
Don't make me shoot you.
You were expensive.
Yes. Yes, that's it.
Come quietly.
Mm... waiting.
For what?
(crunches)
Family.
Ah!
You don't have one.
I made you.
Oh... maybe I could...
You're built to destroy.
You can never belong.
Now come quietly
and we will take you apart.
No, no, no, no,
don't, don't run!
Don't run!
(groans)
(sighs)
(sighs)
(gentle melody plays)
Lilo.
(sniffles)
I didn't hear you get up.
Baby, what's wrong?
Stitch left.
Really?
It's good he's gone.
He didn't want to be here,
anyway.
We don't need him.
(sighs)
Lilo...
sometimes you try your hardest
but things don't work out
the way you want them to.
Sometimes things have to change
and maybe sometimes
they're for the better...
even if...
(knocking)
DAVID:
Nani!
- David!
(panting)
I think I found you a job.
You what?!
Old man Kukhkini's store,
but we got to hurry.
Oh, um, okay. Lilo?
Baby, this is really important.
I need you to stay here
for a few minutes.
I'm going to be right back.
Lock the door and don't
answer it for anyone, okay?
Things are finally
turning around.
Aw, David, I owe you one.
That's okay.
You can just date me,
and we'll call it even.
(weapon firing)
Come back here, you little!
(grunting)
(frantic panting)
Stitch?
What is it?
Shh!
(loud thud, Stitch gasps)
Oh, hiding
behind your little friend
won't work anymore.
Didn't I tell you?
We got fired this morning.
(laughing)
New rules.
(grunting):
Ha!
Ooh.
(laughing)
Oh, ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow!
(ricocheting)
ELVIS PRESLEY:
# You ain't nothin'

What are we going to do?

Ooh! I love this song!

(alien word)
Screwdriver.
Check.
Come out, my friend
from whomever
you're hiding behind.
#... Well, you ain't never
caught a rabbit #
# And you ain't no friend
of mine... #
What the?
Ooh!
(laughing)
Come on!
What's the big deal?
(shouts in alien language)
I'll put you
back together again.
I'll make you taller
and not so fluffy!
I like fluffy!
No... No...
No!
(speaks alien language)
Oh, leave my mother
out of this!
(groans)
You could do with a makeover.
I tried
to give you my good looks
but let's face it,
something went wrong.
No!
(Stitch snarling)
(Jumba grunting)
Quick! Follow me!
If we make it to...
You're alive!
They're all over the place!
(Jumba laughs)
Running away? Here...
let me stop you.
(yells)
(gulps)
You always get
in the way!
Where's the girl?
What have you done
to the girl?
LILO:
Hello? Cobra Bubbles?
Aliens are attacking my house.
No, no, no!
No aliens!
Blue punch buggy!
(sputtering)
No punch back.
(horn beeps)
They want my dog!
There's no need
to alert the authorities.
Everything's under control.
Lilo, who was that?
Oh, good,
my dog found the chainsaw.
Lilo! Don't hang!
(laughing)
(Stitch screeching,
chainsaw buzzing)
Ha!
You shouldn't play with guns.
Oh, okay.
Thank you.
(gun whining in overload)
Oh, I just remembered.
It's your birthday!
Happy birthday!
Merry Christmas!
It's not Christmas.
Happy Hanukkah!
We're leaving Stitch?
Trust me.
This is not going to end well.
- One potato.
- Two potato.
- Three potato.
- Four.
- Five potato.
- Six potato.
Seven potato, more.
(alternating):
My... mother... told... me...
you... are... it.
Oh, I win!
(explosion thunders)
(thud)
(Pleakley yelling)
Thanks. Mahalo plenty.
You won't be disappointed.
I'll show up early to help
with the morning deliver...
(siren wailing, horn blaring)
Oh, don't turn left.
(tires screeching)
No.
(groaning)
(gasps)
One of them had a giant eye
in the middle of his face.
Oh, Lilo!
Please don't do this.
BUBBLES:
You know I have no choice.
No! You're not taking her!
I'm the only one
who understands her!
You take that away,
she won't stand a chance!
You're making this harder
than it needs to be.
You don't know
what you're doing! She needs me!
Is this what she needs?!
It seems clear to me
that you need her
a lot more than she needs you.
Lilo! Lilo!
(Nani in distance):
Lilo!
(Bubbles in distance):
Lilo!
NANI:
Lilo!
BUBBLES:
Lilo!
NANI:
Lilo!
(gasps)
You ruined everything.
You're one of them?
- Ooh!
(grunts)
Get out of here, Stitch.
(gasps)
(twig snaps)
(both grunting)
Surprise!
(laughing)
And here I thought
you'd be difficult to catch.
Ho-ho-ho. Silly me.
Lilo?
(footsteps approaching)
Lilo!
(screams)
(Stitch growling)
(gasps)
(Stitch growling)
(container beeps)
There you go,
all buckled up for the trip.
And look... I even caught you
a little snack.
(gasps)
(Gantu chuckling)
(gasps)
No! Stop!
(engines revving)
(grunting and growling)
(engines whirring)
(Stitch yelling)
Lilo.
(groaning)
Aah!
Okay, talk.
I know you had something
to do with this.
Now where is Lilo?
Talk! I know you can.
(groans)
Okay, okay.
(shrieks)
(groans)
Where's Lilo?
(sighs):
Lilo...
(Stitch yells)
(laughing)
Now all your washing is up!
You're under arrest!
Read him his rights.
Listen carefully.
(Stitch grunting)
(Jumba laughing)
PLEAKLEY:
Hello? Galactic Command?
Experiment 6-2-6 is in custody.
We'll wait right here.
(beeps off)
(Jumba laughing)
(ragged gasp)
(groans)
(laughs)
Huh?
(whispering):
Don't interact with her.
Where's Lilo?
Who?
What?!
Lilo... my sister.
Uh, sorry, we do not know
anyone by this, uh...
Lilo! She's a little girl...
this big!
She has black hair
and brown eyes
and she hangs around
with that thing!
Uh...
(sighs)
We know her.
Bring her back.
Oh, we can't do that. Uh-uh.
That would be a misuse
of Galactic resources.
See, problem is...
were just here for him.
So she's gone?
Look at the bright side.
You won't have to yell
at anyone anymore.
(chuckles nervously)
(sighs)
(sobbing)
Come.
(sobbing continues)
O'hana.
Huh?
Hey! Get away from her.
No! What did you say?
O'hana means family.
Family means...
BOTH:
...nobody gets left behind.
Or forgotten.
Yeah.
Hey... (speaking
alien language)
What?!
After all you put me through
you expect me to help you
just like that?!
Just like that?!
Ih.
Fine.
Fine?
You're doing what he says?
Uh, he's very persuasive.
Persuasive?!
What exactly are we doing?
Rescue.
We're going to get Lilo?
Ih.
(engine rumbling)
Oh, good! I was hoping
to add theft, endangerment
and insanity to my list
of things I did today.
(laughs):
You, too?
(laughing)
(gasps)
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
What? Did you think
we walked here?
(alarm chirps)
This is Gantu, requesting
hyperspace clearance.
COMPUTERVOICE:
Stand by for clearance.
(engines rumbling)
(sniffles)
(engines roaring)
(engines whining)
(brass fanfare plays)
COMPUTERVOICE:
Clearance is granted
on vector C-12.
Connect me
to the Grand Councilwoman.
GRAND COUNCILWOMAN:
Gantu, what's going on?
I thought you'd like to know
that the little abomination
is... is...
(spaceship horn plays
"La Cucaracha")
(squeaking on glass)
(screams)
GRAND COUNCILWOMAN:
Yes, Captain?
(grunting)
I'll call you back.
(engines whooshing)
How did you get out of there?
So what exactly are we doing?
Don't worry,
is all part of plan.
We are professionals.
Hey! Get that out of your mouth!
(shrieks)
Hold on!
(grunts)
Okay, is show time!
(laughing)
(whooshing)
This is it!
(yelling)
(grunts)
Go! Go! Go!
(laughing maniacally)
(growling)
Little savage!
Get off my ship!
(Stitch yelling)
Stitch!
(Stitch yelling)
(grunts)
(grunts)
(grunting)
(groans)
(croaks)
Computer,
locate Experiment 6-2-6.
COMPUTER:
We finish this now.
Stitch is unconscious.
What do we do now?
We stay close.
Hope for a miracle.
That's all we can do.
(engine whooshing)
(croaks)
No!
Don't leave me, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
(horn honking)
(rumbling)
Okay.
(grunts)
(grunting)
COMPUTER:
Target 6-2-6 is in motion.
Speed is 84.
Impossible!
(horn blaring)
Stitch!
Hmm?
(engines roaring)
Abomination.
Stupidhead.
Yee-haw!
Aloha!
(grunts)
(laughing)
You're vile! You're foul!
You're flawed!
Also cute and fluffy!
(Gantu yelling)
You came back.
Nobody gets left behind.
(kisses)
(screams)
Lilo!
Good dog.
(whooping)
(gasping)
Auwe!
LILO:
David!
Hey, Lilo.
Can you give us a ride
to shore?
Uh...
Sure!
But I have to make two trips.
So you're from outer space, huh?
I heard the surfing's choice.
We have 6-2-6.
Take him to my ship.
Leave him alone.
Hold on.
Grand Councilwoman,
let me explain.
Silence!
I am retiring you,
Captain Gantu.
Actually, credit for the capture
goes to...
Goes to me.
You'll be lucky if you end up
on a Fluff Trog farm
after we sort this thing out.
Uh...
I think I should...
You!
You're the cause of all this!
If it wasn't
for your Experiment 6-2-6
none of this...
STITCH:
Stitch.
What?
My name Stitch.
Stitch, then.
If it wasn't for Stitch...
Does Stitch have to go
in the ship?
Yes.
Can Stitch say good-bye?
Yes.
Thank you.
Who are you?
This is my family.
I found it all on my own.
It's little and broken...
but still good.
Yeah. Still good.
Does he really have to go?
(sighs)
You know as well as I
that our laws are absolute.
I cannot change
what the Council has decided.
Lilo, didn't you buy
that thing at the shelter?
Hey!
Three days ago,
I bought Stitch at the shelter.
I paid two dollars for him.
See this stamp? I own him.
If you take him,
you're stealing.
Aliens are all about rules.
You look familiar.
CIA. Roswell. 1973.
Ah, yes. You had hair then.
Take note of this.
This creature has been sentenced
to life in exile
a sentence that shall be
henceforth served out here...
on Earth...
and as caretaker
of the alien life-form, Stitch
this family is now
under the official protection
of the United Galactic
Federation.
We'll be checking in
now and then.
I was afraid
you were going to say that.
This won't be easy to explain
back at headquarters.
I know what you mean.
(quietly):
Don't let those two
get on my ship.
(engines roaring)
CIA?
Former.
Saved the planet once.
Convinced an alien race
that mosquitoes
were an endangered species.
Now, about your house...

Wait.

Let us tell an old story anew,
and we will see how well you know it.
Once upon a time,
there were two kingdoms
that were the worst of neighbors.
So vast was the discord between them
that it was said only a great hero
or a terrible villain
might bring them together.
In one kingdom
lived folk like you and me,
with a vain and greedy king
to rule over them.
They were forever discontent,
and envious of the wealth
and beauty of their neighbors.
For in the other kingdom, the Moors,
lived every manner of strange
and wonderful creature.
And they needed
neither king nor queen,
but trusted in one another.
In a great tree
on a great cliff in the Moors
lived one such spirit.
You might take her for a girl,
but she was not just any girl.
She was a fairy.
There you go.
And her name
was Maleficent.
Good morning, Mr. Chanterelle!
I love your cap!
No. No, don't do it!
You missed me!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Lovely work, girls!
What's all the fuss about?
The border guards have discov...
Why do you get to tell her?
I want to tell her!
I want to!
There are rules, Flittle.
I tell this time, you tell next time.
No, you told last time,
so I should tell this time,
and Thistlewit next time.
Tell me what?
Fine!
Thank you.
Maleficent, the border guard...
The border guards have found
a human thief at the pool of jewels.
I'm sorry.
She's always in a hurry,
with her big wings.
Humans, here.
I hope there's not another war.
I'm not afraid.
Besides,
I have never seen a human up close.
Come out!
No. They mean to kill me.
And besides, they're hideous to look at.
That's extremely rude.
Don't listen to him, Balthazar.
You're classically handsome.
It's not right to steal,
but we don't kill people for it.
Come out.
Come out this instant!
Are you fully grown?
No.
I believe he's just a boy.
And you're just a girl.
I think.
Who are you?
I'm called Stefan.
Who are you?
I'm Maleficent.
Yes, right.
You have to give it back.
Give what back?
If I knew you would throw it away,
I would have kept it.
I didn't throw it away.
I delivered it home,
as I'm going to do for you.
Someday, you know, I'll live there.
In the castle.
Where do you live now?
In a barn.
So your parents are farmers, then?
My parents are dead.
Mine, too.
We'll see each other again.
You really shouldn't
come back here, you know.
It's not safe.
And if I made that choice,
if I came back, would you be here?
Perhaps.
- What's wrong?
- Your ring.
Iron burns fairies.
I'm sorry.
I like your wings.
Maleficent thought of how
Stefan cast away his ring,
he who had so little in the world,
so that their hands might touch again,
and her heart was moved.
Thus did the young thief
who had hoped to steal a jewel...
Maleficent!
...steal something far more precious.
Maleficent?
Maleficent!
After all these weeks,
look who came back.
I thought it worth the risk.
So, what do you do for fun?
Stefan and Maleficent became
the most unlikely of friends.
And for a time it seemed as if,
in them at least,
the old hatred between men and fairies
had been forgotten.
As it will, friendship slowly
turned into something else.
And on her 16th birthday,
Stefan gave Maleficent a gift.
He told her it was true love's kiss.
But it was not to be.
As the years passed, Stefan's ambition
pulled him away from Maleficent,
and towards the temptations
of the human kingdom.
While Maleficent,
the strongest of the fairies,
rose to become
the protector of the Moors.
Maleficent often wandered alone
and sometimes wondered
where Stefan might be,
for she had never understood
the greed and envy of men.
But she was to learn.
For the human king had heard
of a growing power in the Moors,
and he sought to strike it down.
Guard, halt!
Guard, halt!
There they are,
the mysterious Moors
where no one dares to venture
for fear of the magical creatures
that lurk within.
Well, I say crush them!
Go no further!
A king
does not take orders from a winged elf.
You are no king to me.
- Bring me her head.
- Battalion!
Advance!
Arise and stand with me!
Hold the line!
- It's the dark creatures!
- It's the dark creatures!
Charge!
You!
To the king!
You will not have the Moors!
Not now, nor ever!
You...
When I ascended to the throne,
I promised the people
one day we would take
the Moors and its treasures.
Each of you
swore allegiance to me
and to that cause.
Your Majesty.
Defeated in battle.
Is this to be my legacy?
I see you waiting for me to die.
It won't be long. But what then?
I will choose a successor
to take the throne
and care for my daughter.
Who among you
is worthy?
Kill the winged creature.
Avenge me,
and upon my death
you will take the crown.
Maleficent.
Maleficent!
So, how is life with the humans?
Maleficent, I've come to warn you.
They mean to kill you.
King Henry will stop at nothing.
Please, you have to trust me.
They spoke of many things,
and the years faded away.
And she forgave Stefan
his folly and his ambition,
and all was as it had been long ago.
You thirsty?
Maleficent?
What is this?
I have avenged you, sire.
She is vanquished?
You have done well, my son.
You have done
what others feared to do.
You will be rewarded.
I shall do my best
to be a worthy successor,
Your Majesty.
I've got you!
- You wicked bird!
- lnto a man.
It's a...
It's a demon!
What have you done
to my beautiful self?
Would you
rather I let them beat you to death?
I'm not certain.
Stop complaining.
I saved your life.
Forgive me.
What do I call you?
Diaval.
And in return for saving my life,
I am your servant.
Whatever you need.
Wings.
I need you to be my wings.
I present to you the first of his line,
His Royal Highness King Stefan.
He did this to me so he would be king.
Now what, Mistress?
Her wings!
It's a girl!
It's a girl! It's a girl!
Well?
Well, I saw nothing.
But there's been a...
What?
Child.
King Stefan and the Queen
have had a child.
There will be a christening.
They say it's to be a grand celebration.
A grand celebration for a baby.
How wonderful.
All manner of folk
came to the christening,
even a trio of fairies who sought
to foster peace and goodwill.
Look, there's the baby!
I love babies!
Can you just concentrate, please?
I'm not telling you again.
Greetings, Your Majesty.
I am Knotgrass
of the Moorland Fair Folk.
I'm Flittle, Your Kingship.
And I'm Thistlewit, Your Royalnesses.
They bring gifts for our daughter.
These are not just any old gifts,
for, you see, we're magic!
And very good with children.
Very well.
Sweet Aurora, I wish for you
the gift of beauty.
My wish is that you will never be blue,
only happy, all the days of your life.
Sweet baby,
my wish for you is that you find...
- Maleficent!
- Maleficent!
Well, well.
What a glittering assemblage,
King Stefan.
Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and...
How quaint.
Even the rabble.
I must say
I really felt quite distressed
at not receiving an invitation.
You're not welcome here.
Oh, dear.
What an awkward situation.
You're not offended?
Why, no.
And to show I bear no ill will,
I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child.
No! We don't want your gift!
Stay away from the princess!
Yes, stay away!
Listen well, all of you.
Listen well, all of you.
The princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty,
beloved by all who meet her.
That's a lovely gift.
Don't do this.
But
before the sun sets
on her 16th birthday,
she will prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel
and fall into a sleep like death,
a sleep from which
she will never awaken.
Maleficent, please don't do this,
I'm begging you.
I like you begging.
Do it again.
I beg you.
All right.
The princess can be woken
from her death sleep,
but only by
true love's kiss.
This curse will last till the end of time!
No power on Earth can change it.
King Stefan ordered his men
to seize every spinning wheel
in the kingdom.
The wheels were broken and burned,
that they might never be used,
and thrown into the deepest dungeon
in the castle.
Secretly, he entrusted
the safety of the child
to the magic of the pixies,
who would take her to a remote
hideaway for 16 years and a day.
Stefan shut himself behind
the walls of his castle
while his soldiers rode far and wide
to hunt Maleficent down.
But she made walls of her own,
that the Moors might
never again suffer the touch
of any human.
And she reveled in the sorrow
that her curse had brought.
The fairies began their charge
to raise Aurora in a snug little cottage
in the woods.
No! Is this it?
Looks dreadful.
Come on.
We need a smaller...
Baby-
Or bigger bodies.
No, what we need is a proper disguise.
What do you mean?
Well, we have to blend in, don't we?
We have to be big enough
to look after this baby.
So, gather around, ladies.
Get ready. One, two, three, grow!
That's worked quite well.
That's very nice.
Now, there will be no questions asked.
We are no longer fairies.
We are three peasant women
raising our orphan child in the woods.
- Yes.
- So, no more flying.
- No flying?
- No, no, and no magic.
- No magic?
- Yes, you heard.
It's in the middle of nowhere.
At least no one will find us here.
There you are.
Why are you always hiding?
Come on. There you go.
It's so ugly, you could
almost feel sorry for it.
I hate you. Beasty.
The fairies were
perhaps unequal to their task.
Why is she crying?
I think she might be hungry.
Then feed her!
There you are.
There you go.
It's going to starve
with those three looking after it.
It tickles.
- What?
- You're cheating.
I saw that!
- We're starting again.
- Suit yourself.
Greedy, bloated goat!
"Bloated goat."
Stop doing that.
I'm not doing anything.
Well, someone is.
It's not me.
You two are having a go at me,
and I will not tolerate...
Stop it!
Why...
No!
This is all your fault!
Come on. That's funny.
As the days went on, Stefan darkened,
further consumed
by paranoia and vengeance.
- Burn it all down!
- Yes, sir!
Flame!
Release!
Run!
You failed me.
The wall cannot be burned.
It is indestructible.
Nothing is indestructible!
Not the wall! Not Maleficent!
Not even her curse!
Bring me the iron workers.
You!
Look.
The little beast is about
to fall off the cliff.
What?
Hello.
Go away.
Go.
Go away.
I don't like children.
Up, UP-
Go along. Go, go, go.
As Maleficent had said,
Aurora did grow in grace and beauty.
Pretty bird.
Far away from the lofty palace
that she remembered not.
And as the seasons changed
and the flowers grew,
so did she.
Hello.
That's it.
There you go.
She wondered at the world about her,
and at what lay beyond
the fearsome wall of thorns.
Curious little beasty.
But she was not the only one
who wished to get through.
Look.
- Is that her? Is that Maleficent?
- I don't know.
Bring them to me.
No, it's just a silly peasant girl.
Steady.
- It's her!
- It's her!
How could you do that to me?
You said anything I need.
Yeah, but not a dog.
It was a wolf, not a dog.
It's the same thing.
They're dirty, vicious,
and they hunt birds.
Fine. Next time I'll turn you
into a mealy worm.
Well, I'll be a mealy worm, gladly.
Anything but a filthy, stinking...
I wonder.
I know you're there.
Don't be afraid.
I am not afraid.
Then come out.
Then you'll be afraid.
No, I won't.
I know who you are.
Do you?
You're my Fairy Godmother.
What?
Fairy Godmother.
You've been watching over me
my whole life.
I've always known you were close by.
How?
Your shadow. It's been following me
ever since I was small.
Wherever I went,
your shadow was always with me.
I remember you.
Pretty bird.
This is Diaval.
Hello, Aurora.
I have known you
since you were a little one.
It's everything I imagined it would be.
It's just so beautiful!
I've always wanted to come...
Good night, beasty.
You mock me.
I know what you're doing.
I know exactly what you're doing.
Sire?
Your presence has been
requested by the Queen.
Leave me.
Sire, she is not well.
The nurses are fearful
that she won't make it through the night.
Can you not see
we're having a conversation?
When the curse fails,
Maleficent will come for me.
And on that day, I will be ready.
They're so beautiful.
I revoke the curse.
Let it be no more.
I revoke the curse.
Let it be no more.
I revoke my curse!
Let it be no more!
I revoke my curse!
Let it be no more!
Let it be no more!
This curse will last till the end of time.
No power on Earth can change it.
Do all the Fair People have wings?
Most do.
Then why don't you?
All the other fairies fly.
I had wings once.
They were stolen from me.
That's all I wish to say about it.
What color were they?
Were they big?
So big
they dragged behind me when I walked.
And they were strong.
They could carry me above the clouds
and into the headwinds.
And they never faltered, not even once.
I could trust them.
She's coming. She's coming.
Where are your workers?
In their beds, Majesty.
Get them back to work without delay.
They're exhausted, sire.
But I'll have them
back to work at first light.
I need them back to work now.
It's the wee hours.
Aye.
Aye.
It is the wee hours.
So wake them up.
Sire?
So wake them up,
and get them back to work now!
We're running out of time! Go, now!
Aurora?
Come here.
Sit.
There's something I need to tell you.
What is it?
There is an evil in this world,
and I cannot keep you from it.
I'm almost 16, Godmother.
I can take care of myself.
I understand.
- But that's not what I have to tell you.
- I have a plan.
When I'm older,
I'm going to live here
in the Moors with you.
Then we can look after each other.
You don't have to wait until you're older.
You could live here now.
Then I Will.
I'll sleep in a tree
and eat berries and black nuts
and all the Fair People
will be my friends.
I'll be happy here for the rest of my life.
I'm going to tell my aunties tomorrow.
Until tomorrow.
I'm so excited!
Aunties, I'm almost 16.
I need a life of my own.
No. I love you very much,
but it's time to say goodbye.
You've been very good to me,
except the time
you accidentally fed me spiders.
Hello.
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm on my way
to King Stefan's castle
and I've become hopelessly lost.
Can you help me?
I'm sorry. That was my fault.
I rushed in too...
Forgive me.
It's that way.
The castle.
What's your name?
It's Philip.
Hello, Philip.
What's yours?
Aurora.
Hello, Aurora.
Well, it was nice meeting you.
And once again, my apologies
for being such a clumsy fool.
You're forgiven.
That's good.
I'd best be off, then.
Good bye.
Will you be back this way?
Nothing could stop me.
Then I'll see you soon.
Very soon.
- Goodbye, Philip.
- Goodbye, for now.
Stop doing that.
Well?
That boy's the answer.
- No, Diaval.
- Yes!
True love's kiss, remember?
It can break the spell.
True love's kiss?
Have you not worked it out yet?
I cursed her that way
because there is no such thing.
Well, that might be how you feel,
but what about Aurora?
That boy could be her only chance.
It's her fate, anyway.
Go ahead.
Turn me into whatever you want.
A bird, a worm.
I don't care anymore.
I'm so happy we're leaving tomorrow.
We are not leaving tomorrow.
Tomorrow is Aurora's 16th birthday.
And Stefan told us to take her back
the day after her birthday.
No. He said on her birthday.
No. The day after her birthday.
- On.
- After.
- On.
- After.
- On, on, on!
- After, after, after!
Stop it!
What?
How could you?
I need to talk to you about something.
Yes, sweetie, what is it?
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
but I'll be 16 tomorrow.
Yes.
I'm leaving home.
See here, young lady.
I did not spend 16 years
in this miserable hovel
with these two imbeciles...
So that you could ruin it on the last day.
We are taking you back
to your father with...
My father?
You told me my parents were dead.
I think you better come and sit down.
Fairy Godmother!
I'm here.
When were you going to tell me
that I'm cursed?
Is it true?
It is.
My aunts said it was an evil fairy.
I... I can't remember her name.
They said
it was...
Maleficent.
Is that you?
Are you Maleficent?
No!
Don't touch me.
You're the evil that's in the world.
It's you!
Find the boy!
I need every available man
on the east wing now.
There should be no guards at the gate.
I want her to walk right in.
Sorry to disturb, Your Majesty.
We found this urchin at the gate.
She claims to be the princess.
Father.
It's me, Aurora!
You look just like your mother.
They brought you back a day too soon.
I told those three idiots!
Lock her up in her room.
Go.
Prepare the men. Maleficent's coming.
It's so good to be small again!
Look at my feet!
I love my tiny little feet!
Pay attention! We have to find Aurora,
or the king will have our heads!
Aurora.
Wait!
Princess?
I'm looking for a girl.
Of course you are.
I need a horse.
...into a sleep like death.
Aurora.
Come on, Diaval!
Aurora.
Faster, Diaval, faster!
She will prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel
and fall into a sleep like death.
No power on Earth...
A sleep like death.
It's done.
They pulled the guards.
He's waiting for you in there.
If we go inside those walls,
we'll never come out alive.
Then don't come. It's not your fight.
Thank you very much.
"I need you, Diaval.
I can't do this without you, Diaval."
I can hear you.
Look at her.
Look at what you've done.
She's only sleeping.
She's only sleeping, you say?
She's only sleeping.
She's only sleeping forever!
- What about the kiss?
- Yes! True love's kiss!
True love does not exist.
But it's her only chance, Your Majesty.
Mistress.
What are we going to do?
We can't give up, can we?
Come on, girls.
But we don't even know where to start.
True love doesn't just fall
from trees, you know.
Pardon me.
I'm embarrassed to say
I don't know where I am.
In King Stefan's castle.
This is where I'm meant to be.
Odd that I can't recall how I got here.
Why have you come?
My father sent me to see the King.
Who is your father?
King John of Ulstead.
A Prince!
Aurora.
He knows her.
Why is she sleeping?
She's trapped in an enchantment.
Isn't she beautiful?
The most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Do you want to kiss her?
Very much.
Go on, then.
I wouldn't feel right about it.
I barely know her. We've only met once.
Haven't you ever heard
of love at first sight?
Kiss her!
Go on.
An enchantment, you say?
Kiss her!
You didn't do it properly!
It's supposed to be true love's kiss!
I was certain he was the one.
- What are you doing?
- We have to keep looking.
I told you.
I will not ask your forgiveness
because what I have done to you
is unforgivable.
I was so lost
in hatred and revenge.
Sweet Aurora,
you stole what was left of my heart.
And now I have lost you forever.
I swear, no harm will come to you
as long as I live.
And not a day shall pass
that I don't miss your smile.
Hello, Godmother.
Hello, beasty.
No truer love.
She's here, sire.
Are we going back to the Moors now?
If that is what you wish.
We've got her!
- Stop!
- Get back!
No!
Into a dragon.
To the other side.
Run, Aurora!
Get back! Hold it steady!
Pull to the left! Pull!
Hold the line!
Look out. Hold your line.
- Close in.
- Bring it down!
Enough!
How does it feel?
To be a fairy creature without wings
in a world where you don't belong?
Kill her!
Kill her!
Shoot!
Shoot her!
Take aim!
It's over.
Maleficent brought down
her wall of thorns
and took off her crown.
And she invited Aurora to see
how the Moors had been once,
long ago, when Maleficent
was but a child
and her heart was bright.
For now, it was again.
But that was not all.
There she is. Hurry up. They're waiting.
Wait for me!
We present this crown
to our little Aurora,
for whom we have sacrificed
the best years of our...
Never mind.
Our kingdoms have been unified.
You have your queen.
So you see,
the story is not quite as you were told,
and I should know,
for I was the one
they called Sleeping Beauty.
In the end, my kingdom was united
not by a hero or a villain,
as legend had predicted,
but by one who was
both hero and villain.
And her name was Maleficent.
Hi.
I'm Dory.
I suffer from
short-term memory loss.
Yes!
-That's exactly what you say.
Okay, okay.
We'll pretend to be
the other kids now.
Hi, Dory.
-Ahoy, there.
Do you want to
play hide and seek?
Okay.
I love to.
We'll hide and you count
and come find us.
Okay, Daddy.
No, no.
Not daddy.
I'm the nice fish
who wants to be your friend.
Okay?
-Okay, Daddy.
No.
-I'm hiding.
Now count to 10.
1, 2, 3.
Uh.
4... um...
I like sand.
Sand is squishy.
Mommy, can I go
play with them?
Dory?
-Dory!
Dory, cupcake.
Dory, honey.
-Hold your toes, sweetie.
Remember, honey.
We have to stay away
from the undertow.
Okay, sweetheart.
What about the rhyme we learned.
We see the undertow
and we say.
Let's go.
No.
No.
It's, "Heck no!"
Okay?
Let's try it again.
We see the undertow
and we say.
There's the undertow.
There's the undertow.
There's the undertow.
There you find the undertow
and we see the undertow.
Did I forget again?
-No, no.
No, sweetie. It's okay.
-No biggie, cupcake.
What if I forget you?
Huh!
Would you ever forget me?
Oh cupcake, no.
-We will never forget you, Dory.
And we know
you'll never forget us.
FINDING
DORY
Hello?
Hello?
Did you hear that?
-What's that? Hear what?
Stan, I just...
I heard someone say hello.
Who?
I didn't hear anybody said hello.
I don't know, Stan.
I just heard someone say hello.
Yeah, there's a lot
of fish here.
Anybody, literally anybody
could have just said hello.
Hello?
There.
-Where?
There. There, right there.
-Wh-What am I look?
There.
-Oh.
Hello?
Hello.
-Oh my goodness, it's a child.
Hello.

Hi.
Hi, I'm Dory.
Can you please help me?
Oh hi, Dory.
Ar...
Dory, are you lost?
Where are your parents?
Umm.
I can't remember.
Oh.
-We'll look around. Uh.
Are any of this fish
your parents?
Hi, I'm Dory.
Can you please help me?
Huh?
-Um.
Honey, you just...
you just said that.
I did?
-Mm-hm.
I'm sorry.
I suffer from
short-term memory loss.
Oh, how awful.
-Short-term memory loss.
Okay, just...
You wait here for one second,
okay, sweetpie.
Stan. Stan. Stan.
-What? What?
What do I do?
The poor thing is lost.
I don't know.
I mean...
We have to do something.
-What do you want me to do? I mean...
She can't remember a thing!
-She could come from anywhere.
Well.
You are-You are no help today.
-I'm just...
Dory. sweeitie, how about we...
-Oh, she's gone.
Dory?
-That's not good.
Dory?
-Dory?
I'm Dory.
I lost my family.
Can you help me?
I'm Dory.
I suffer from short-term memory... huh!
Just keep swimming.
Just keep swimming.
Hi. I lost my family.
Can you help me?
Where did you see them last?
-Well, uh...
Funny story.
But... I forgot.
Aw, sweetie.
Do you want to come swim with us?
That is the nicest offer
I've gotten all day.
I... I think.
I can't remember.
Anywho, thanks.
But, heheh, I'm looking for someone.
Oh,
Can't remember.
Can't remember.
Hi!
I'm Dory.
Was it something I said?
Kidding. Okay, okay.
You're not coming back.
I was looking for something
and I...
Okay, totally get it.
Date night. Have fun.
Well. I hope you find whatever
it is you are looking for.
You and me both.
Any idea what that was?
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Guess we'll hang out another time.
Don't be a stranger... stranger.
Huh?
A white boat!
They took my son!
My son!
Help me, please!
LOOK OUT!
Oh. Oh.
Sorry!
Are you-Are you okay?
He's gone. He's gone.
-There, there.
No, he's gone.
-It's alright.
He's gone.
-It'll be okay.
No. No.
They took him away!
I... I have to find the boat.
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat.
-You have?
Uh-huh. This way!
It went this way.
Follow me.
-Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
one year later
Hand me the ratchet wrench.
So I can fix it.
Ow!
Hey, Marlin.
Oh.
Hey, guys.
I was just...
Ow ow ow...
Dory, it's not time
to get up yet.
You have to go back to bed.
-Remember. There aren't any mistakes.
Alright.
Yeah, sorry.
Back to bed.
Back to bed.
Hey, Marlin.
Oww!
Go back to bed.
That was it.
Very simple, bed.
-Ah.
Back to...
-Got it.
Hey, Marlin.
-And... we're up.
That's it, ready to start the day.
And we were looking
for something.
Nemo.
-Right.
I remember it like
it was yesterday.
Of course I don't really
remember yesterday all that well.
Anyway.
I would say, the scariest moment
of the trip was the 4 sharks.
Wait.
I thought there were 3 sharks.
No. No.
There were definitely 4.
But the last time you told it,
there were 3.
Son. Which one of us traveled
across the entire ocean.
Nemo did.
Obviously we had to cross
the ocean to find him. So...
You know, he went first.
I guess that's true.
Isn't it?
Well.
You made it.
You almost missed the field trip.
-A field?
Ooo, I love field trips.
Where are we going?
I thought you told her.
-I did tell her.
Uh, Dory.
-Yeah.
Mr. Ray has too many fish
to keep an eye on today.
Uh-huh.
-So.
It would be best if today...
-Um-hm.
If you weren't exactly...
with the class.
-Oh. Why not?
You know, you have problems
remembering things sometimes.
That's the one thing
I can't remember, yeah.
Okay.
Sometimes it's not your fault,
but it can cause you to wonder.
And Mr. Ray doesn't really
have time to worry about...
Fish who wonders.
-Sure.
In another words, he doesn't
have enough help.
Poor guy.
You know, he's so overworked.
You understand.
-I totally understand now.
Okay. Good.
-Mm-hm.
He wants me to be
the teacher's assistant.
Uh. No, not exactly.
-Well, I'm so honored.
I've never been a
teaching assistant before.
Mr. Ray, you got help.
Oh ho ho.
Okey-dokey!
Alright, kids.
-Alright, kids.
Today's the day.
-Today's the day.
- Field trip to the stingray migration.
-Stingray migration.
Now, does anyone know
why we migrate?
Come on, you got
to know this stuff.
Migration is about going back to...
Bed!
-Yes.
No.
-No.
The sand!
-No.
Migration is about going home.
-Home.
Which is where you are from.
-Where you are from.
Can someone tell me
where they are from.
I live by a giant rock.
I live 3 coral caves
away from here.
My house is covered in algae.
Where did you grow up, Dory?
-Me?
Um.
I don't know.
My family.
Where are they?
Can I help you?
I'm sorry. Did I forget again?
See, I suffer from...
Short-term memory loss.
-Short-term memory loss.
So how can you remember you have a
family if you have short-term memory loss?
Good question.
Good question.
See, I can remember somethings
because well, they make sense.
Like... what.
I have a family.
I-I know, because I... You know,
I must've come from somewhere, right?
Everyone has a family.
And I may not remember
their names and
what they look like.
And I may not even be able
to ever find them again. But...
What are we talking about?
-Mommies and daddies.
Mommies and daddies, right.
Why are we talking about
mommies and daddies?
Oh. Oh.
That class.
Oh oh.
Why me? Okay.
You guys seem
really young but...
Okay.
You see, kids.
When 2 fish love each other...
And, we'll stop right there.
Climb aboard, explorers.
I feel a migration
song coming on.
Migration, migration, let's learn about migration.
It's nature's inspiration
to move around the sea.
Here's a scientific commerce.
Where did everyone go?
By myself...
Oh there they are and back.
What's minus 4 degrees
based on solar positioning.
Oh, kids.
Stay away from the edge.
Okay. You hear that.
Okay.
Everybody stay back from the edge.
Come on.
Okay, that's too far.
-That's too far, come on.
Come on, get back over here.
Back this way.
Now, I need everyone to listen.
-Alright, listen up.
When the rays pass through here,
-The rays, they are going to pass through.
What do we have to be careful of?
-Everybody has to be careful of what?
The undertow.
-The undertow.
That's right.
-That's right.
The under...
The undertow.
Because the current created
by all the flapping is very strong.
If you are not careful,
you can get pull in.
Mr. Ray. So how do the stingrays
all know where to go?
That's what an instinct is, Nemo.
Something deep inside you
that feels so familiar that
... you have to listen to it.
Like a song you've always known.
And I can hear mine now!
Our hearts know where to go.
Oh, we're going home.
Whoa.
-Whoa.
To make our way back home.
Oh, we're going home.
Wow.
We, see the undertow.
And we sang...
AH!
Dory!
-Dory!
Dory.
Dory.
Huh!
Is she dead?
No, she's not dead.
Give her some space, everybody.
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.
Oh. I remembered something.
It's uh.
Huh!
I remembered something.
I actually remembered something.
Something important.
Something important, what?
What was it?
I'm not sure anymore.
But I can still feel it, it's...
Alright.
Thank you, Mr. Ray.
Try to remember better.
Don't be such a dory, Dory.
Uh. Oh!
Oh!
What?
Did you remember?
I don't remember.
It was something.
It was...
Oh, oh, oh.
It was something about... the...
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.
Huh!
My family!
I remember my family!
They are out there somewhere.
I have to find them.
Guys, you got to help me.
Guys.
Guys, hello?
Guys, where are you?
Dory.
-Hello?
Dory.
Ah.
Where did you go?
-You were the one who go.
My parents.
I remembered them.
What?
What did you remember?
I remember them.
My mom, my dad!
I have a family!
Oh.
They don't know where I am.
Let's go. We have to go.
-Dory. No.
No!
This is crazy.
Where exactly are you
trying to go?
To the... To the...
gym of the... Baltic.
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.
-Yes!
No, Dory. California is all
the way across the ocean.
Then we better get going.
-How come everytime
we're on the edge of this reef,
one of us is trying to leave?
For once, can't we
just enjoy the view.
How can you be talking about the view
when I remembered my family.
No! No!
We've done our ocean travels.
That part of our lives is over.
The only reason to travel
in the first place, is so you
don't have to travel ever again.
Yeah, but I want to...
Dory, look.
-Please.
All I know.
Is that I missed them.
I really, really missed them.
I didn't know what that felt like.
Do you know
what that feels like?
Yes.
I know what that feels like.
I don't want to forget this.
Somewhere out there
is my family.
Please, Marlin.
I can't find them on my own.
I'll forget.
Please help me find my family.
Yeah, Dad.
You can get us all the way
across the ocean. Right?
No.
But I know a guy.
Woo hoo!
Righteous!
Righteous!
Hoo hoo!
Ta-day!
Totally sick!
Totally sick!
I know.
Isn't it great?
No!
I'm going to be totally sick.
It's the California current, dude.
Got some abhorrent job.
Surf's up, dude.
-Aw!
Hey, dude,
if you're going to hurl,
just do me a solid.
Head to the back of the shell.
Lean out and
go for distance.
We call that,
"Feeding the fishes!"
And now, we are looking
for my parents at
the brooch of the
Atlantic or the...
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.
-Exactly.
How are you going
to find your parents?
Do you remember what
they looked like?
I'm a bit new to the memory
thing so I can't say for sure.
But something tells me
they were mostly blue with...
... maybe yellow.
-That sounds right.
Also, I'm pretty sure I'm going
to know them when I see them.
We're family.
By the way, crossing the ocean is the
kind of thing you should only do once.
One time!
-Morro bay, California's coming up, dudes.
Woo hoo!
Let's find my family.
Go! Go!
Go, go, go!
Just go, Dad!
-Don't push me, Nemo.
Woo!
-Ahh!
Woo hoo!
Ha ha.
So long, little blue.
I hope you find your parents.
And good luck feeding the fishes.
Too late, I already fed.
Oh.
This feels familiar.
Mom!
Dad!
Dory. Dory. Dory.
Wait. Wait.
Mom! Dad!
-Stop yelling for a second.
Do you really think your parents
are just going to be
floating around here waiting for you?
Well, I... I don't know but
there's only one way to find out.
Mom! Dad!
-Shout louder, Dory.
MOM! DAD!
-Shhh shh shh.
Huh!
What was that?
Wait.
I heard that before.
I remembered someone
saying shh shh shh.
Yes, well done.
That was me, 1 minute ago.
Shh shh shh.
-Huh!
Please, have you seen
my mommy and daddy?
Their names are
Jenny and Charlie.
Shh shh shh.
-Shh shh shh.
Huh!
Jenny and Charlie.
What? Jenny and what?
-Those are their names.
My parents are
Jenny and Charlie!
Shh shh shh.
-Dory, wait!
Jenny!
-Can't we just take a moment
Charlie!
- to come up with a plan.
Jenny! Charlie!
-Shh shh shh.
Are you crazy?
-Sorry, she's-she's a little excited.
Jenny! Charlie!
-Dory. Dory. Stop yelling for a second.
It's not a good idea to come
into a new neighborhood
and call this much
attention to yourself.
You don't understand.
I remembered my parents names.
Jenny Charlie!
-Dory. Dory.
These crabs are locals.
And I get the feeling they are
shushing us for a reason.
You might wake up something dangerous.
-Are you talking about.
Like something with one big eye,
tentacles and a snappy thing?
Well, that's very specific.
But something like that, yes.
You just in general
don't want to...
Oh, hi.
-Oh boy.
Goodness.
Okay.
We made a mistake.
We're backing away.
Let us live.
And we will...
We'll worship you.
We'll build a...
-Uh.
Do you like a...
Do you like a monument?
Ahh!
-Ahh!
Whoa!
Swim for your life!
Nemo!
-Nemo!
Nemo!
-Dad!
Nooo!
Nemo, hold on to me!
And don't let go!
Dory! Dory.
Dory, slow down.
We're not being chased anymore.
-Are you sure?
AH!
Jenny.
Jenny and Charlie.
Jenny and Charlie!
Jen...
I just-I just remembered their names.
We have to keep going,
we're so close. Huh?
Are you hurt?
Huh!
Oh my goodness, Nemo.
Are you okay? What happened?
-Not now, Dory. Please.
Oh no. Oh no. Nemo.
-I'm okay. I'm okay.
Oh no. Oh, Nemo.
I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.
Huh!
Oh my goodness.
Nemo, are you okay?
-I said not now.
You've done enough.
-I have?
Oh no.
But I... I can fix it.
I can.
I'll go get help.
You know what you can do, Dory?
You can go wait over there.
Go wait over there and forget.
That's what you do best.
You're right.
I don't know why I thought
I could do this.
Find my family, I can't do this.
I'm so sorry.
I'll fix it.
-I'm okay.
Well.
I'm going to get help, okay?
Okay? I can do that.
I'll-I'll be...
It will be alright, Nemo.
Hello?
Someone, hello.
Anyone?
Hello.
Anyone?
-Hello.
Hello?
-I'm Sigourney Weaver.
Oh. Hi, Sigourney.
I need your help.
Won't you please join us.
-Oh, Great, great, great.
As we explore the wonders
of the Pacific ocean
and the amazing life
it holds within.
Sigourney?
Sigourney Weaver, where are you?
Dory, there you are!
-Guys, I found help.
Sigourney Weaver is going to
tell us where we are.
Look out!
-Ah!
Aw. Look at this.
-No respect for ocean life.
Marlin! Nemo!
-Dory!
No, no, no.
Not again! Not again!
Let's take her inside
and see how she does.
Dory! Dory!
-Don't worry, Dory!
Keep calm!
We'll come find you!
And welcome to the
Marine Life Institute,
where we believe in rescue,
rehabilitation and release.
Marlin?
Nemo?
Hello? Hello?
Can you help me?
Me? Help you?
Ah-choo!
Ehhh.
AHH!
Ah!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh?
What's happening?
Help.
-Looks like we're done here.
Dude, cut it out.
You're a scientist.
We've talked about this.
Oh, come on.
It's funny.
Okay.
Okay.
Just get a hold of yourself.
Ah!
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.
Hey, you.
-Oh.
Spinner.
-Huh! Thank goodness.
Hi, I'm Dory. I'm...
-Name's Hank.
How sick are you?
-Sick? I'm sick?
Why else would you
be in quarantine.
Oh no.
How long do I have?
I have to find my family.
-Alright now. Don't get hysterical.
Oh oh.
Not good.
What? What is it?
What happened?
Huh! What's that?
-That there, is bad news.
It's a transport tag for fish who
can't cut it inside the institute.
They get transferred
to permanent digs.
An aquarium in Cleveland.
Fish in here,
go back into the ocean.
Cleveland fish, stay there forever.
-Huh!
Cleveland, no!
I can't go to the Cleveland.
I have to get to the jewel of Morro bay,
California, and find my family.
That's this place,
The Marine Life Institute.
The jewel of Morro bay, California.
You're here.
-You mean I'm from here?
My parents are here.
I have to get to them.
So what exhibit are you from?
-Wait. I'm from an exhibit?
Which one?
I have to get there.
That's a hard one, kid.
Unless.
Nah. It'd never work.
It's too crazy.
What do you mean? Just tell me.
I'm okay with crazy.
You know I can see that.
Well, there's one thing I can think of
to help you get to your family.
If I just take...
-Yes! Great idea.
You take me to find them.
Why didn't I think of that?
Uh. No, no, no.
If I just take your tag.
I can take your place
on the transport truck.
Then you can go back inside
and find your family.
All you have to do
is give me the tag.
What tag? Huh!
There's a tag on my fin.
Huh? How can you forget
you have a tag on your fin?
Oh no. I' sorry.
I...
I suffer from
short-term memory loss.
You don't remember what
we were talking about?
Mm-mm, not a clue.
What were we talking about?
Um.
You were about to
give me your tag.
Well, I kind of like my tag.
Why-Why do you want it?
SO I CAN GO TO...!
So that I can go to Cleveland.
-Cleveland.
I hear good things about Cleveland.
Why do you want to go there.
Because if I stay here I'm going
to get released back into the ocean.
And I have extremely unpleasant
memories of that place!
I just want to live
in a glass box alone.
That's all I want.
GIVE ME YOUR TAG!
Hey, man.
Don't touch my tag.
Look.
I don't work here.
It's not like I have
a map of this place.
Huh! A map.
Good idea.
You take me to the map.
I figure out where my parents are.
Oh boy.
Alright.
If I get you to your family
will you give me...
I don't have much.
Um.
I... How about if
I give you this tag.
Great idea.
Are you absolutely sure
that's what I said?
"Go wait over there and forget.
That's what you do best."
Yeah, Dad.
-I said that?
You said that.
Dory swam to the surface, and
then she got taken by someone...
Alright, I don't want to
hear the whole story again.
I was just asking
about the one part.
Because, look, if I said that.
I'm not positive I did.
It's-It's actually a complement.
Because I asked her to wait.
And I said,
"It's what you do best."
So I...
I...
Oh, it's my fault!
It's all my fault!
She got kidnapped and taken into...
whatever this place is.
What if it's a restaurant?
Oy! You two.
Shut it.
Yeah, we're trying to sleep.
And you interrupted my favourite dream.
Is that the one about
you laying on this rock?
Yeah.
-Oh, that is a good one.
Oh. Yeah.
-It's one of my favorites.
Uh, Excuse us. Hello.
-Son. Son. Son.
We're trying...
-Those are sea lions.
They are natural predators.
They could pounce at any moment.
They don't look very pouncey.
-That's what they want you to think.
Just get behind me
and let me do the talking.
Excuse me.
We're worried about our friend.
Is that a restaurant?
Ah ha, mate.
It's not a restaurant.
Your friend is okay.
-She is?
It's a fish hospital.
Sigourney Weaver says,
she'll be rescued, rehabilitated
and released.
She'll be in and out in a jiff.
We should know.
Nasal parasite.
-Anemia.
All fixed up and
sent on our way.
Oh.
Thank goodness.
Sure. That's alright.
Don't you worry...
Oy! Gerald.
-Gerald! Get off!
Shove off!
-Get off, Gerald!
No, you know that! Off!
-You're not fond of.
Off!
-Off!
Don't you worry about a thing.
That place is the Marine Life Institute.
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.
Huh!
She was right.
Looks like Dory can do
something besides forget.
Thank you, Nemo.
Thank you for that.
So how are we
going to get inside?
Wait.
You want to get inside, me lad?
Desperately.
Our friend is in there, lost, alone.
She's scared.
She'll have no idea what to do.
Oh.
We know a way.
-You do?
What are they doing?
I don't know.
It sounds bad.
Are we there yet?
-Shh, keep it down.
Hank, I'm so glad
I found you.
It feels like... destiny.
For what must be the millionth time.
It's not destiny.
Oh oh.
Have I said destiny before?
I'm sorry.
I'm just so nervous
because I'm going
to meet my parents.
I hadn't seen them in...
I don't even know how long.
Because, you see I suffer from
short-term memory loss.
-Short-term memory loss.
Look. No more talking, okay?
I don't like talking.
I don't like chattering,
questions and...
"How are you?",
"Oh, I'm fine."
"How are you?",
"Oh, I'm fine too."
News flash.
Nobody's fine.
Oh, I'm fine.
How are you?
Hank, look.
There's a map.
Shhh. The plan is
you're going to read that.
And figure out
where your parents live.
And I'm on a truck
to Cleveland.
You got it?
-Got it.
What was the first part again?
-Oh.
What?
The octopus escaped again.
Wow.
Look at all the exhibits.
How can you do this park
in one day, seriously.
Pick one!
-Okay.
Well, tell everyone to
keep an eye out.
I mean, we're suppose to be releasing
the octopus back to the ocean today.
Well.
Of course I haven't seen it.
If I was looking...
Hey.
There you are.
Hurry up.
-Okay. Okay. Okay.
It starts with a 'K'.
[KID ZONE] font
color="#64cdff"[OPEN OCEAN] -Kiidd Zzz onee. Kid zone.
No. No, kids.
Kids grab things.
And I'm not losing
another tentacle for you.
You lost a tentacle?
Well, then you're not an octopus,
you're a septopus.
I may not remember
but I can count.
Hurry up!
-Okay.
Journey to the deep.
Hey look, shells.
Huh!
Hey look, shells.
Daddy, here's a shell for you.
-Oh, that's great, Dory.
You found another one.
-I did?
Oh yes, you did.
You're getting good at this, Dory.
Hey look, shells.
Hey, I live here.
-Yes. Yes indeed.
I like shells.
Ahaha.
That's right, dear.
Do you think you can
find me another shell?
The purple ones are my favourite.
Okay, Mommy.
Oh, Mommy.
Purple shell.
Purple shell.
Hank, my home had a purple shell.
-So what?
Half the exhibits here
have purple shells in them.
No, no, no.
You don't understand.
I remember her now.
Purple shells were her favourite.
And she had this adorable giggle
and my dad was really funny.
And now your wacky memories
are going to get us caught.
Still think this is destiny?
Hank, we need to find my folks.
-Quiet.
Base, this is Carol.
I think I might have
found that missing octopus.
See what you did?
-Sorry.
This could not be worse.
DES-TI-NY.
Huh, Destiny?
Come on.
-Hank.
Don't talk just hide.
-I got a feeling.
I think we should get into the bucket.
-No, stop.
Seriously, it says 'Destiny'.
And it is.
No, no, no, no, no.
-We got to get in that bucket.
I'm not going with you
in that bucket.
I go in that bucket.
-Don't. Don't go in that bucket!
Bye.
Hey, guys.
I'm looking for my family.
Oh, good idea.
Play dead.
I'm sorry.
I got to blink.
How do you hold your
eyes open that long?
Hey, guys.
Wait a second.
Ah!
Ah!
Our next guest, has been
here a very long time.
She's a whale shark.
Her name is Destiny.
Destiny, really?
You'll notice,
she's extremely near sighted.
And has trouble navigating
her environments.
Oh.
And here she comes now.
Ooo. Destiny.
Huh! You're a fish?
Wait.
What?
Hi. Hello there.
Can you help me?
Whoa!
Alright, I'll go with you.
Excuse me, hi.
-Who is that?
Is that blue blob talking?
Can you help me?
I lost my family.
You lost your family?
-Well, it's a long story.
And truth be told,
I don't remember most of it.
Oh, that is so sad.
You poor thing.
OW!
Sorry, not a great swimmer.
I can't see very well.
Oh.
I think you swim beautifully.
In fact, I've never seen a fish
swim like that before.
Thank youuu.
Youuuu're welcommme.
Wait.
Say that again.
Um.
Youuuu're welcommme.
Dory?
-Yes.
Dory.
-Yes.
Dory?
-Yes.
Ah, Dory.
-Yes.
You and I were friends!
-No.
Dory, it's me, Destiny.
-You know me?
Of course. We talked through
the pipes when we were little.
We were pipe-pals!
-We were?
Aw, you're so pretty.
So you know where I'm from?
-Yep.
You, are from the
open ocean exhibit.
Oh!
-I'm from the open ocean exhibit?
Then that's where my parents are.
We got to go.
Can you take me there?
Uh. Kind of tough for a whale
to travel around here.
Can you please keep it
down over there.
My head hurts.
-Who's that?
That's my neighbor, Bailey.
-Uh-huh.
He was brought in
with a head injury.
I know you're talking
about me, Destiny.
He thinks he can't
use his echolocation
but I overheard the doctors talking.
-I'm right here.
There's not a thing
wrong with him.
I can hear every word
you're saying about me.
What's echolocation?
Well, Bailey's head is suppose
to put out a call and the echo
helps him find objects far away.
Oh but apparently,
he's still healing.
Now I know you're
talking about me.
I really can... echolocate.
-Oh.
I cannot have this conversation again.
I just can't.
I hit my head very
hard out there.
See how swollen it is?
-Your head is suppose to be big.
You're a Beluga.
-Echolocation.
Oh. Like the world's most
powerful pair of glasses?
What?
-What are glasses?
Sort of like, you go wooo.
And then you see things.
Why do I know that?
Oh.
That's interesting.
There you are.
-Hank.
Listen up. You and I are square.
-Hank.
I took you to the map,
now give me that tag.
Wait, wait, wait.
No.
I know where my parents are.
They are in...
What's it called.
The place... it's... silted ocean.
Open ocean.
-Open ocean.
Open ocean!
-Huh!
Open ocean.
I know where that is!
That's the exhibit located
right next to, I don't care.
Easy.
-Huh!
If you are trying to get to
the open ocean exhibit,
just go through the pipes.
Through the pipes, great.
-Through the pipes?
Yep. Take two lefts.
Swim straight, and you'll hit it.
Oh, that's a lot of directions.
That's... Did you get that, Hank?
All that?
Uh, yeah.
-Great, let's go.
I'm not going with you.
I won't fit.
You'll have to go by yourself.
Um.
Uh. That's...
That... I'm...
See, I can't.
Because I'm not so good with directions.
Well, that's too bad.
A deal is a deal.
You want to find your parents.
That's how you get to them.
Now give me your tag.
-But, Hank.
I... can't go in the pipes alone.
I'll forget where I'm going.
Not my problem.
Tag.
But I can't get in that way.
Well, I'm sorry.
But there's no other way!
There's no other way.
Huh!
There's no other way.
Now, now, don't panic.
-No dear.
It's okay.
You know, not everything in life
is easy to do.
Isn't that right, Charlie?
Yeah.
Your mother's right.
When something is too hard, Dory.
You should just give up.
Charlie!
-A joke.
I'm kidding, just a joke.
-Okay.
A joke.
Uh, caution.
Joker at work.
-Joke, I got it.
You see, cupcake.
There's always another way.
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, Daddy.
Huh! Nope.
My father said there's always another way.
What?
There is no other way.
Open ocean. Open ocean.
Open ocean.
Open Ocean, I'm pretty sure
it's the building over there.
It's ill defined and roundish.
Like Bailey's head.
-Wait. What?
There's always another way.
There's always... huh!
There.
Guys, follow me.
I know how we can get to locomotion.
Open ocean. -Open
ocean. -Exactly.
Uh.
Guys.
Guys. You know I can't
swim over there, right?
I don't see how this is
going to get us inside.
What are you even doing?
-We're calling her over, of course.
Calling her over.
Calling who over?
Lads.
Meet Becky.
Flying?
No no no...
New information.
Listen, tell her thank you.
I mean, you guys have gone
above and beyond, really.
But is there a way to get in
that involves like swimming.
Because that's really our strength.
Look, your friend is going
to be in quarantine.
+ QUARANTINE
-That's where they take the sick fish.
And the one and only one way
into that place is Becky.
Hi, Becky.
Ow!
Stop.
Lets call her Pecky.
This is really...
-I think she likes you, Dad.
Becky, love.
These 2 nice fish need
to get into quarantine.
Are you free today, Rebecca darling?
Becky, is...
Would that work with your schedule?
Ow.
She doesn't understand what I'm saying.
All you have to do
is imprint with her, mate.
I'm... what?
Imprint.
-Imprint.
Look her in the eye
and say, Oorrooo.
And she'll be
in sync with you.
Now, look her in the eye.
-Yeah!
Nemo.
I think we should device
and alternate plan.
One that involves
staying in the water
That's all I'm saying.
Because this bird, this bird...
This ain't the bird!
-That's find, Dad.
And in the mean time,
Dory will just forget us.
Like you say.
It's what she does best.
Fine.
Uh, okay.
Look her in the eye.
Which-Which eye?
-Just pick one, mate.
Becky.
Oorroo, Becky.
Okay.
This is all great.
How exactly is Becky
suppose to carry us?
Oh, yeah.
I almost forgot.
Gerald.
Gerald.
Give us your pail.
We'll let you sit on the rock.
Yeah, Gerald.
We swear it.
That's right.
Chive on over here.
Come on, you can do it.
That's right.
-Mind your nose, scuff your bump.
Thank you so much, Gerald.
Welcome to your time
on this rock.
Comfortable, ain't it?
Time's up.
-Time's up.
Now get off!
-Get off, Gerald!
Off!
-Off!
This is nuts!
Why do I keep getting
talked into insane choices?
Good luck!
Okay.
When I tell you, you're gonna...
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I'm gonna signal with a big splash.
On my mark.
Not clear yet.
Not clear yet.
Now?
-Not till Destiny gives the signal.
You know something?
I've no idea why
you're even doing this.
What do you mean?
It seems like a lot of trouble
just to find some more fish.
If I had short-term memory loss,
I just swim off into the blue
and forget everything.
I don't want to do that.
I want my family.
Not me, kid.
I don't want anyone to worry about.
You're lucky, no memories.
No problems.
-Huh.
No memories, no problems.
Still not clear.
Still not clear.
You don't have to say it
when it's not time.
Not...
-Just tell me when it is time.
Okay, here we go.
And wait!
Here we go, wait.
Are you serious?
Okay, on the count of three.
Don't count, just say go.
-GO!
Now! Now!
Do it! Do it!
Wow, look at that.
I mean...
That's the signal!
-Go, go, go. That's the signal!
Now remember.
Destiny said, follow the signs to
the Open Ocean exhibit. -Uh-huh.
I can't see squat.
So it's your job to look for it.
Got it.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
I'm just going to repeat it, okay?
That should work.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Go right.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Ow!
Left.
And steer clear of people, will you.
Especially kids.
I don't want to be touched.
-Shh. Do not mess me up.
Ah!
-Wah!
Oh, poor baby.
Let me get that for you.
Here you...
Woo!
Oh my.
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Oh, sorry.
Okay.
I was looking, looking...
Oorroo, Becky.
Drop us anywhere.
We're okay.
Just wait, Dad.
I think she's looking
for a place to land.
She's confuse, Nemo!
She doesn't even know
which way to look!
Wait, wait, wait!
Becky! Becky!
What are you doing?
Oorroo.
Oorroo roo roo roo.
Okay, it's going somewhere.
The question is where?
Which way?
Do you see the sign?
I'm looking.
I'm looking.
Something to something
that gets me to my family.
My family!
The world's most powerful pair of glasses.
I know that.
Why do I know that?
It's another memory.
Hank, we need to go that way.
Left.
Go-go left.
OPEN OCEAN
Becky.
Oorroo, oorroo.
She can't hear you, Dad.
Alright, alright, alright.
New plan.
We have to get closer to Becky
so she can hear us.
I don't think we should
move the pail.
Nemo.
Without me, Becky's lost.
Dad, just trust her.
-Trust her?
So she can forget us altogether?
I trust Becky.
-You trust Becky.
Becky's eating a cup.
Becky. Beck?
Oorroo.
GIFT SHOP
Well.
At least we're not stuck
in a bucket anymore.
We're on top of quarantine.
The baby otter tour
is beginning now.
Why, thanks, Sigourney Weaver.
Hey, who want's to
learn about otters?
Looking for the world's most
powerful pair of glasses.
Huh!
Otters!
It's a huge cuddle party!
Huh!
Cuddle party, I'm in.
Where are we?
Are we close to open ocean?
Uh, yes, I think.
Well, I don't know.
But I saw that other sign so...
-What? What other sign?
The world's most powerful
pair of glasses.
What?
What are you talking about?
Why would we follow that sign?
-Well... Because I remembered it.
No, no, no.
That wasn't the plan.
WAHH!
Alright, that's it!
You've wasted my time.
-Wait, no.
That transport truck leaves at dawn
and I'm not missing it.
So give me your tag.
-Wait. No.
Now I remember that sign.
-So?
So I'm remembering more and more
and I feel like my memory is getting better.
I think we should...
-NO! Your memory is not working!
You can't remember anything!
It's probably how you lost
your family in the first place!
Huh!
Alright. Look.
Let's just take it down a notch.
Just give me the tag, you know.
-You know something?
For a guy with 3 hearts
you're not very nice.
3 hearts?
What are you talking about?
I don't have 3 hearts.
-Yes, you do.
I don't.
-You do.
Don't.
-Do!
Stop saying that!
-Fun fact.
The octopus has 3 hearts.
2 pump blood to the gills.
-What?
While the third pumps blood
through out the body. -Wait.
KID ZONE
You know, someone with 3 hearts
shouldn't be so mean.
And it's mean to say that
I would lose someone I love!
INTERACTIVE
FISH POND
I did not lose them!
Hank?
Hank!
Hank?
Hands.
No, not Hans.
I'm looking for Hank.
Hands.
-Hank, with a 'k'. "Hankk."
Hands!
-Hands?
Oh, hands!
Hank!
Hank?
My arm!
-Hank!
INTERACTIVE
FISH POND
Where are you, Hank?!
Can you please help me?
I'm looking for...
Please help me.
I've lost my friend, Frank.
I'm sorry, not Frank.
-You're in my space!
He's an octopus.
No, sep-septopus.
He-That's right, he's a septopus.
Septopus. Septopus. Septopus.
Huh!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, septopus.
He's camouflaged.
Hank.
Come on, Hank.
Let's get out of here.
Hey, what are you doing?
-Hank!
Wh-Wh-What's the plan?
The plan is I'm going to
stay here forever.
Okay.
Good plan.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Hank.
I'm sorry I can't remember right.
Huh!
Sweetie. Sweeite. Careful.
-Watch out, cupcake.
Ho ho.
Watch where you are going.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I'm sorry I can't remember right.
Sweetie. Sweeite.
You don't need to be sorry.
You know what you need to do?
Just, keep swimming.
-Yeah.
And I bet you can
remember that because...
We just... We're gonna...
We're gonna sing a song about it.
Just keep swimming.
-Just keep swimming.
Swimming.
-Swimming.
What do we do? We swim.
-What do we do? We swim.
Swim.
-Swim.
Just keep swimming.
Just keep swimming.
Huh!
My parents taught me that song!
We sang it as a family.
All this time I thought I made it up.
What song?
-Just keep swimming.
Hank.
We... just got to keep swimming.
What?
No way!
Listen to me.
It's too dangerous to move.
No, you listen to me.
I know you're scared.
But you can't give up.
Follow me.
Just keep swimming.
Just keep swimming.
Ahhh!
My mom wrote this song for me.
It's gonna get us out of here.
Sing with me, Hank.
Come on.
I'm coming Mommy.
I'm coming Daddy.
Stop.
-Huh?
Turn back.
-Turn back.
You are heading right for poker's cove.
-You are heading right for poker's cove.
Poker's cove.
-Poker's cove.
Poker's cove?
-Incoming!
What is it?
Sorry.
-That's okay.
Everybody does it.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Hank?
Oh, Hank.
There you are.
Wow.
You got us out of there.
Huh.
I did.
I got us out of there.
I mean technically,
you also got us in there.
But, if you hadn't, I'm not sure
we would have gotten... here.
Echolocation.
Echolocation.
Huh!
The world's most powerful pair of glasses.
We found it.
No, no, no.
You found that.
Welcome to the open ocean.
Home.
OOrroo.
Oorroo Oorroo.
Oorroo.
Dad, stop.
She's not coming back.
She might.
Oorroo.
Dad. You made her feel
like she couldn't do it.
You're not talking about Becky,
are you?
I missed Dory.
Me too.
The truth is I'm just
so worried about her.
She's the one that should be
worried about us.
Well, she would definitely have
an idea what to do if she were here.
I don't know how she does that?
-I don't think she knows, Dad.
She just... does.
Then we'll just have to think.
What would Dory do?
-What would Dory do?
Yeah!
What would Dory do?
She would access her situation.
And she would evaluate.
And she would analyze her options.
Dad, that's what would Marlin do.
Right, that's what I would do.
She wouldn't even think twice.
She would just look at the
first thing she sees and...
That was awesome.
Dory would do it.
Nemo, hold on to me.
Hey, it's working!
Just keep gasping.
Are you okay?
-Yeah.
What would Dory do now?
-Who's Dory?
Oh boy.
Are we happy to see you.
Happy to see me?
I'm happy to see you!
I haven't had anyone
to talk to in years.
Years, wow.
Well, unfortunately we can't stay long,
we have to go because we...
Now why would you want to go?
You just landed.
Stay a while.
Tell me all about yourself.
Well I would love to, but my son
and I have to get to quarantine so...
Wonderful thing to have a son.
-Ah yeah, it is.
Of course I don't have a family.
I dated a nice scallop for a while.
-Well that's fascinating.
But scallops have eyes, she was
looking for something different.
I'm kidding, well not about
scallops having eyes, they do.
And they see into your soul
and they break your heart.
Oh Shelley.
Why! Why!
Now what would Dory do?
Come with us, as we explore the
mysterious world of the open ocean.
Okay, follow me.
You're in a cup.
-Right, I'll follow you then.
Wait.
An octopus has three hearts.
Huh, that's a fun fact.
We're-We're here.
This is-This is really happening.
-Shh.
Well.
Looks like this is it, kid.
Now, I got a truck to catch.
-Wait. Wait.
I had something for you.
Tag.
-The tag, right.
You know.
I think I'm going to remember you.
Ah.
You'll forget me in a heartbeat, kid.
Three heartbeats.
I'll have a hard time
forgetting you though.
My parents are actually down there.
You okay?
I'm ready.
Yeah.
I think you are.
Whoa oh.
Wow!
Where are they?
Okay.
Okay.
Pardon me.
Uh. Oh.
Hi. Hello. Have you seen
a mom and a dad without me?
Excuse me.
Have you seen a couple?
They are old like you, not old
like you but older than you even.
Okay.
Bye.
Hi. Do you know anyone
who lost a kid?
A long time ago,
that would be me.
I don't know how long ago exact...
Okay, you're in a hurry.
Ho ho.
Watch where you are going.
Sorry.
Huh!
It's our goal that every animal
we rescued and cared for
will eventually returned home
to where they belong.
Shells.
And, there we go.
Now, if you ever get lost, Dory.
-You just follow the shells.
I love shells.
Huh!
Follow the shells.
Hey, I live here.
-Yes. Yes, indeed.
Huh! My home!
That's my home!
Mom!
Dad!
Okay, cupcake.
Now count to 10.
1, 2, 3.
Huh!
Youuu're welcome.
Who're you talking to, cupcake?
-My pipe-pal, Destiny.
Mom.
Dad?
Mommy loves purple shells.
Huh!
Mommy?
What's going to happen to her?
-There, there, Jenny.
Oh no. Don't cry, Mommy.
Don't cry.
Do you think she's... that she
can make it on her own, Charlie?
Oh honey.
It will be okay.
Mommy loves purple shells.
Dory!
-Dory?
Dory!
Mommy?
AHHH!!!
Dory!
-Dory!
MOMMY!
DADDY!!!
My parents.
I...
I lost them.
It was my fault.
Where's your tag?
-Huh?
Your tag, it's missing.
Is that why you are
not in quarantine?
Quarantine?
-Yeah!
That's where they took
all the blue tangs.
Isn't that right, Bill?
-Yep.
The blue tangs are getting
their own exhibit in Cleveland.
They'd ship out on a truck
at the crack of dawn.
Must be nice.
-What?
No. No.
My parents are back in quarantine?
They are being shipped to Cleveland.
But I just-I just got here.
I've got to get to them.
They don't know I'm here.
Don't worry, it's easy
to get to quarantine.
You can just go through
the pipes, honey.
Oh, I can't do that.
-Why not?
I'll forget where I'm going.
And I can't be somewhere
where I... have nobody to help me.
Well, then I guess you're stuck here.
Huh.
You're not helping, Bill.
Just go in there if you want to.
You'll be fine.
Oh boy.
Could you uh.
Could you tell me how to
get there, through the pipes?
Sure, honey.
It's 2 lefts and then a right.
Simple.
Okay.
2 lefts and a right.
I can do this.
2 lefts and a right.
Okay.
Don't forget.
2 lefts and a right.
2 lefts and a right.
2 lefts,
and-and a right?
Shoot.
Left and right.
Wait.
Did I already take a left?
Oh no, it's happening.
Okay, hold on.
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
Which way?
Where am I going?
I can't remember. Okay.
Okay, I'm lost.
This is too hard, I can't remember.
I'm forgetting everything.
I'm going to be
stuck forever in the pipes.
The pipes.
The pipe-pals.
Pipe-pals.
Pipe-pals!
And... Swim, swim, swim.
-Yeah, I don't know about this.
Trust me.
I won't let you hit anything.
Wall.
What's the point!
I'll never learn to get around.
You better.
If you can't do it in here,
you'll never do it
out in the ocean.
Now really focus, okay?
Wall!
Destinyyy.
Dory?
Hellooo.
I'm lost in the pipes and
my parents are departing.
Hang on, Doryyy.
Bailey, you got to use your echolocation.
-You know it's broken.
Just stop it and try the ooo thing
Dory talked about, will you?!
Huh, I don't think I can.
-Don't bail on me, Bailey!
Come on, Bailey.
What did you just tell me, huh?
Really.
Focus.
I feel stupid.
Bailey.
-Sorry.
Hellooo.
-Uh, here.
We're hereee.
Guys.
Guys.
What? What?
What is it?
I'm getting something.
Here we go.
Oh yes.
I can see the quarantine!
Ha ha ha!
This is amazing!
I can see everything!
And I can see you!
He can see youuu.
My life's a rainbow!
Can you see me?
Oh wait.
It doesn't work that way.
-Bailey!
Okay.
Tell Dory to go left.
He says go leeeft.
-Leeeft?
Straight.
-Straiiight.
Straight.
Go right.
-Riiight.
Riiight?
I'm light headed.
Wait.
-What?
I'm picking up something else.
Hold on, let me zoom out.
Huh!
Holy Neptune.
She's not alone.
-What? What is it?
I can't tell but it's coming for her.
-Oh no!
Doryyy, swimmm!
Swim the other wayyy.
-What? Whereee?
What? Where?
-Go right!
Riiight.
No, my right!
Oh no.
She's heading right towards it.
No!
Dory, turn around!
That's great, Dory!
You're heading right towards us.
What?
You want me to go right?
No. No. Not right.
Oh, I can't look.
AHH!
-AHH!
Dory! -Dory!
-Marlin?
Oh my gosh!
-Dory, you're okay!
It's consuming her.
-Dory.
It's eating her alive.
-Oh Dory.
You're okay.
You found me!
How did you find me?
There was a crazy clam.
He wouldn't stop talking.
We just slowly back away from
him and into these pipes.
And then we just
started looking.
Doryyy, I'm sorryyy.
Okay.
What was that?
Hang on, I got to take this.
It's oook.
Sorry for whaaat?
What? You're okayyy?
-Yes!
I found Marlin and Nemooo.
Dad, did you hear that?
Dory really does speak whale.
I heard it.
And it's bringing back
some very bad memories.
So let's get out of here.
I say we... we go this way.
Follow me.
It's time to head home.
Wait, wait, wait. Um. Um.
My parents are here.
They are?
-You found your parents?
Well, not exactly.
No.
I mean, not yet.
But uh, I know where they are.
And I don't know exactly
how to get there.
But I know that...
Well, I'm getting help.
Down to quarantinnne.
-Quarantine, that's it.
Oh, and I met this septopus.
Super cranky but secretly kind of sweet.
And he got me into the exhibit...
The exhibit.
Dory?
Do you think my parents
will want to see me?
What?
Why wouldn't they want to see you?
Because...
I lost them.
Dory.
Your parents are going to be
overjoyed to see you.
They're going to miss
everything about you.
Really?
-Dory.
Do you know how we found you?
-Something about a clam or...
No. No.
-No, an oyster.
Mollusc.
-No.
Something... I don't know.
-No. No clam.
We were having a very hard time.
Until Nemo thought,
"What would Dory do?"
Why would you say that?
Because ever since I've met you,
you showed me how to do
stuff I never dream of doing.
Crazy things.
Outsmarting sharks and
jumping jellyfish.
And finding my son.
You made all that happened.
Really?
I didn't know you thought that.
Unless I forgot.
No, you didn't forget.
I never told you.
And I'm sorry about that.
But Dory,
because of who you are
you are about to find
your parents.
And when you do that.
You...
You'll be home.
Dad?
Does this mean we have
to say goodbye to Dory?
Yes, Nemo.
We do.
Hey! So how much more
we got left to load?
Uh, just this last row.
The sooner we finish.
The sooner this truck gets to Cleveland.
TL59
-Watch the turn. -Watch what?
Ow!
-Too late.
Okay, I think we're close.
Hi!
-Hi!
Is this quarantine?
-Yes, this is it.
We're in quarantine.
My parents are here!
Yay!
-Yay!
Where are we going?
Hey, no no no.
Why are we going
towards the door?
We are all better!
Yay!
-I feel fantastic!
Ahchoo!
Dude.
Huh!
My family.
Come on, let's go.
Excuse me.
-Dory, wait a minute!
I'm coming, Mommy!
I'm coming, Daddy!
Woo-hoo!
Almost home.
I think I'm getting
the hang of this.
I heard footsteps.
Huh! Hank!
-Quiet.
Hank, we need to
get in that tank.
Huh! That rhyme.
-Why?
Her parents are there.
Oh.
Look.
You got 3 minutes to get
everyone in this cup with you.
And then I'm on
that truck to Cleveland.
Got it?
-Got it.
Oh boy.
Mom?
Dad?
Hey, everybody.
It's me, Dory.
Dory?
Mom?
Dad?
Mom?
Dad?
She should just pick two
and let's go.
Dad.
-What?
I'm kidding.
It's a reunion.
Mom?
Dad?
Where are my parents?
Dory?
Are you really Jenny
and Charlie's girl?
Yes, I am.
That's me.
Where are they?
Well, Dory.
Right after you disappeared.
They thought you...
Well, they thought you must have
ended up here, in quarantine.
Uh-huh.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
And.
So they came here.
To look for you?
-They're here!
Where are they?
Dory, that was years ago.
-Huh?
They never came back.
Oh no.
You see, Dory.
When fish don't come back
from quarantine, it means.
They're not...
-What?
Dory, they're gone.
Huh!
They're... dead?
They wanted to find you.
-Wait, are you sure?
Are you sure they're gone?
Dory, listen.
It's going to be okay.
Oh Dory,
they loved you so much.
Anyone not looking to go
to Cleveland, final warning.
Dory, are you alright?
-Are you okay?
I was too late.
-Dory, no.
Now listen.
-I don't have a family.
No, Dory.
That's not true.
Time to go!
I'm-I'm all alone.
Dory.
-Dory!
Where's everybody else?
Your orange friends are
on their way to Cleveland.
Gotcha.
I found the octopus.
Aw!
Where did he go?
Huh!
Mommy?
Daddy?
No. No.
No.
Help.
Help me.
Help.
Help me, please.
Somebody help me!
Hey, can...
Help me.
Can you help me.
I've lost them.
-Oh.
I...
-Lost who?
I...
I...
Sorry, honey.
I can't help you if
you don't remember.
Huh!
Oh.
Hey, can you help me?
I've lost... them.
-Uh, can you be more specific?
My. My them.
Them. Them.
Help.
Help.
Please.
They're gone!
Lost.
I've lost everyone.
There's nothing I can do.
Shoot, I can't forget.
What was I forgetting?
Something.
Something important.
Wh...
What was it?
I...
What was it?
It's going away.
It's going away.
It's going because
all I can do is forget.
I just forget
and I forget.
It's what I do best.
It's what I do.
What do I do?
What do I do?
What would Dory do?
I would look around.
And um,
it's just water over there.
And a lot of kelp over here.
Kelp is better, okay.
Now what?
Lots of kelp, looks the same.
They all look the same
except there's a rock.
Over there,
and some sand... this way.
I like sand.
Sand is squishy.
This isn't going anywhere.
There's nothing here.
Nothing but kelp.
Lots of kelp and
some shells.
This... way.
I like shells.
I like... shells.
Whoa!
Hello.
I'm...
Dory!
-Dory!
Look at you.
Oh, my baby.
-I believe you.
I mean, look at you.
-You found us.
I'm never letting you go again.
-My missing girl, you are here.
It's you.
-Yes.
Really you.
-Oh, absolutely.
Mom, you're actually here.
You're...
I am.
And Dad, so are you.
-I'm right here, cupcake.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, honey.
-What?
Oh, honey.
No, no, no, cupcake.
I know I've got a problem.
I know I'm...
And I'm so sorry that all this
time and I want to fix it.
And I can't. And I try I try.
-Oh, Dory.
But my thoughts, they leave my head.
And ideas changed and...
I've forgotten you
and I'm so sorry.
Dory, Dory, Dory.
Don't you dare be sorry.
Look.
Look what you did.
What?
You found us!
-That's right, you found us.
Honey.
Honey.
Why do you think we
stay put here all these years?
Because we believe one day
you'd find us again.
-Exactly!
But.
I thought you were gone.
How did you?
We went into quarantine
to look for you.
But you weren't there.
And we knew you must have
gotten out through the pipes.
Through the pipes.
That's right, sweetie.
So.
-So, we did too.
And we stayed, in this spot
for you ever since.
Because-Because we thought
you might come back.
So everyday, we go out
and lay out...
Shells.
And you found us.
Oh honey.
You found us.
And you know why you found us
because you remembered.
You remembered in your own
amazing Dory way.
I did.
All by myself.
-Oh honey, really?
Have you been by yourself
all these years?
Oh my poor little girl.
Oh, I haven't been all by myself.
Huh!
Marlin and Nemo!
Nobody saw where Dory went?
No.
-No.
Seriously?
That's a lot of eyeballs doing nothing.
Oh oh oh. Excuse me.
Can you help us.
We're look...
-Me? Help you?
Ahchoo!
Huh! Dad, look!
It's Dory!
Oh, thank goodness.
See, Nemo.
I knew she'd find a way... What?
Hey, where's Dory?
Is she with you?
Huh!
I'm sorry.
I tried to hold on
but I couldn't and...
I lost her.
-What?
Alright.
Let's get going.
NOOOO!
And then, the whale swallowed us,
even though I speak whale.
A whale?
-Good thing I wasn't there to see that.
Actually, Marlin never believes that
I even know how to speak whale.
But, you know what?
He always kind of trust me anyway.
You know.
I like this Marlin already.
Yeah, and then somehow
we found Nemo.
Or did he find me?
I don't know.
But, you now what?
Nemo is the sweetest.
He just never gives up
on me no matter what.
Um.
What would Dory do?
Okay. We'll go this way.
-Well. We'll certainly have to thank...
Wait.
Wait, I know this place.
Hello.
-Huh!
I'm Sigourney Weaver.
-There!
Won't you please join us.
-That's the Marine Life Institute.
Oh, you were born there.
-Dory, is that where your friends are?
Yes, they were stuck in...
in something.
They were-They were going...
somewhere.
Huh, a truck.
They're in the truck.
That means I can... huh!
Never see them again.
No.
No no no.
What would Dory do?
What would Dory do?
I know they are good friends of yours.
But a truck is kind of a tall order.
Yeah. You mother's right, Dory.
-Please! Please!
All I know is that I... missed them.
I... I...
I really-I really missed them.
I've said that before.
Um.
Dory.
Mom.
Marlin and Nemo are
more than good friends.
They're...
They're family.
And I have to
get them back.
See. When they found me,
it felt like fate.
Do you know what I mean?
Or...
What's another word for fate.
Like.
Destiny.
Destiny!
Destinyyy!
Dory?
-Destinyyy.
Morning, Destiny.
-Shh shh shh, shush.
It's Dory.
Something's wrong.
I got her!
She's right outside the institute.
Destiny!
We got to jump.
-Jump?
No time to argue!
Destinyyy.
-Dory. Dory.
The truck thing with
your friends is leaving.
Oh no! That's bad.
-No no no no.
What do we do?
-Destinyyy!
Alright.
-Yeah.
Here we go.
-Yes.
One.
-Yes.
Two.
-I CAN'T!
I can't do it!
I'll never make it out there!
Destiny!
-Huh?
I got the world's most
powerful pair of glasses.
You got the world's most
powerful pair of glasses.
I will be your eyes.
-You're going to be my eyes.
But-But the walls!
-There are no walls in the ocean.
No walls?
It's your destiny, Destiny.
Well, why didn't you say so!
-What? No, Destiny.
Wait.
NO, that's a wall!
WALL!
Mom, Dad.
This is my pipe-pal, Destiny.
Say hi.
Dory.
Are these little blue blobs your parents?
They look just like you.
Hello, I'm Bailey.
Mrs. Dory, Mr. Dory.
Oh please, call me Jenny.
-Oh, I'm-I'm Charlie.
Okay, okay, we got to go.
We got to stop that truck.
Okay.
What truck?
Huh!
Bailey, status report.
Oh yes!
My beautiful gift!
Found it!
The truck's merging onto the
freeway, it's heading south.
Let's go.
We are stopping that truck.
This, I got to see.
-Yeah, yeah, me too.
Oh boy, this is going to be good.
Huh! What the?
Gerald?!
Have you lost your marbles?
-Don't get used to it, Gerald!
Cheeky Joe, that one.
Bailey, I forgot everything,
catch me up.
Yes, ma'am.
Your friends are still
on the truck.
They're heading north
towards the bridge.
Oh look.
There's a bunch of
cute otters over there.
I want one.
Ow!
-Ahh!
Ow!
Bailey!
Oh oh oh.
I see the truck!
It's over there!
I don't see how
we can get on it, Dory.
Oh man, if only there was
a way to stop traffic.
Stop traffic.
Stop traffic.
Everyone needs to stop.
People stop to look at things.
Things that they like.
Things that are cute.
Huh!
Things that are cute!
Okay, I got it.
-What? What is it?
Quickly before I forget.
Destiny, when the truck reaches the bridge,
you flip me up there.
-Got it.
You guys.
Follow me.
Everyone else, stay here.
-Whoa. Whoa.
Dory, honey.
You're not leaving us again.
Your mother is right.
You have to stay with us.
Dory, sweetie.
What happens if...
You know, if you're gone for...
-Mom.
I don't know, too long and...
-Mom.
What if you get confused.
-Mom.
And that makes you distracted.
And what if...
I lose you again?
Yes.
Mom, Dad.
It's going to be okay.
Because,
I know that even if I forget.
I can find you again.
Okay, a little left.
Back the other way a bit.
Okay, that's it.
Yo. Don't do it.
-Bailey!
Okay. Now, now!
Do it! Do it!
Time for your idea.
-Okay. What idea?
Okay. Okay.
Okay.
What do I do? What do I do?
What would Dory do?
Come on, cars.
Cars, I see cars.
Otters in front of cars.
Car have to stop.
Stop traffic!
Cuddle party!
Look out!
They're so cute!
-Aww.
Look at them.
There must be, 1, 2, 3...
What's going on, Dad?
I don't know how.
I don't know in what way.
But I think this has
something to do with...
Dory!
-Dory!
Water. Water.
I need water.
Are you crazy?
How do you get here?
Dory!
-Dory!
I thought we'd
never see you again.
Ah, me too.
But darn it.
No matter how hard I tried,
I just couldn't forget you.
Guess I miss the rest of
my family too much, huh.
We're family?
-Mm-hm.
Do you know what
that feels like?
Yes.
I know what that feels like.
Aw!
-Aw!
Hey!
Hey, come on.
Out of the truck.
Those aren't your fish. Shoo.
Oh no.
There goes our ride.
Back in the water, come on.
Doryyy, the traffic is starting to mooove.
Leave it to me.
I got this.
Becky.
Becky, come back!
We need your help, Becky!
Wahh!
Dory, follow me.
No, no, wait.
We don't have Dory!
No, no, Becky.
Wait. Stop.
We need to go back.
Becky.
Back, back, Becky.
Ahh!
Please don't eat us!
Where's Dory?
-Who are you?
Jenny?
-Marlin?
Charlie?
-Nemo?
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
-Thank you for taking care of our Dory.
Dory!
She's still in the truck!
Becky!
Back to Dory!
Oorroo Dory!
Okay, kid.
I guess this is goodbye.
No.
-What do you mean, no?
I mean, you're not
going to the Cleveland.
You are coming to
the ocean with me.
What is it with you
and ruining my plans.
Listen to me.
I have one goal in life.
One. And it is to...
-No, you listen to me.
What is so great about plans?
I never had a plan.
Did I plan to lose my parents?
No.
Did I plan to find Marlin?
No.
Did you and I plan to meet?
Wait, did we?
-Are you almost done?
Well, I don't think we did.
And that's because the best things
happened by chance.
Because that's life.
And that's you being with me,
out in the ocean.
Not safe in some
stupid glass box.
Can I say something?
-I'm not done!
A friend of mine,
her name's Sigourney,
once told me that all
it takes is 3 simple steps.
Rescue, rehabilitation and
one other thing, that is...
Release!
-Release!
Yay!
-Yay!
That's right.
So, what do you say?
Release!
-Release!
Release!
-Release!
I was going to say, okay.
Not good.
Oh, no, no.
-Where are they going?
Charlie, they are going away.
-What do we do?
Quick, guys, grab my fin.
He's trying to get
the door open
It's locked from the outside!
Come on, Dory.
You can do it!
Destiny.
Destiny!
Wall! Wall! Wall!
-Whoa!
Oh no.
-Oh no.
Dory!
No, wait!
Dory!
-Dory!
Bailey, where are they heading?
I'm losing them!
Dory.
It's over.
No. There's-There's...
There's got to be away.
Yeah.
-Yeah.
Dory, now listen to me.
There's no way to get out.
But, there's got to be a way.
There's always a way.
There isn't, Dory.
I'm telling you,
this time there's
no other way!
Well, what about that?
Holy carp.
There is another way.
Take a deep breath, kid.
Release!
-Release!
Ahchoo!
Excuse me.
Release!
-Release!
What is that?
-I don't care! Just get it off!
What?
-What the?
Suck it, bipeds.
Alright, Hank.
You got 7 arms.
I don't know.
Just try something.
Okay.
Here we go!
Huh?
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Stop!
What?
Oh.
That's doing something.
-And we are moving.
Good job, Hank.
-Wait. Wait. Wait.
Hey!
-Come on!
Wait.
Wait.
Listen, I'm not trying
to tell you how to drive,
certainly I can't...
I'm not in any position.
But could you...
could you go faster?
Hey, slow...
Hey!
Give us our truck back!
I can't see squat!
Which way are we going?
Okay.
Well...
All the cars are going left.
So-So, go left.
Gilman Street.
Ashby Avenue.
Oh, Gilman street... again.
Huh, Gilman street again.
How much longer are
we going to veer left?
It's okay.
We just need to
know how we got on.
And then we'll know
how to get off.
Well, let me know
when you figured it out.
Unfortunately I can't remember
how we got on.
Huh!
Hey, I know those guys.
That's where we came from.
Turn right.
Here we go!
Hey, hey, hey!
-Wahh!
Whoa!
-Whoa!
HEY!
We are so fired.
Keep straight, straight.
Left. Left.
No, no, no, no.
Right. Right. Right.
Good driving, Hank.
-Pay attention to the road.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh oh. Fork in the road.
Which way?
-Uh.
Ocean. Ocean.
Hey, a boat!
You know, I have had great
experiences with boats but...
Which way!
-Uh.
Huh!
Boats go to the ocean!
Right.
-Hold on!
We're out of time, kid.
Where do we go now?
Um. Well, um.
Okay, I'll figure it out.
I don't-I don't know.
But, well.
Something will come and...
Huh!
Seagulls!
Hank, follow those birds.
The ocean is left, Hank.
Hold on.
I'm getting something.
Is it them?
Is everything perfect?
Oh oh, it's the fuzz.
Busted.
Okay, we're good.
Huh, the ocean.
It's straight ahead, floor it.
-Now we're talking.
Oh. Oh oh.
-What do you mean, oh oh?
Oh no.
What would I do?
What would I do? What would I do?
What would I do?
Hank, I'm gonna ask you
to do something crazy.
I'm okay with crazy.
Alright, Hank.
There's no way out!
It's over!
They are going to fish jail!
Wait.
Oh no.
Get back!
Get back...
AHH!
-AHH!
I see trees of green,
red roses too.
I see them bloom,
for me and you.
Free!
-Free!
Dory!
What lies before you represents
the third and final part
of the marine life mission.
Rescue, rehabilitation and release.
Come to Papa.
I'm Sigourney Weaver.
Thank you for joining me.
1, 2, 3, 4.
Uh... Wait a minute.
Why am I counting?
Hey, where's everyone?
Oh oh, did...
Did they leave me?
No. No no.
They wouldn't do that.
Okay, that's okay.
I can figure this out.
What was I just doing then?
I was um...
I was covering my face.
So I was trying to hide.
Okay.
So why was I trying to hide?
Wait, huh!
Oh, I'm...
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
Ready or not, here I come!
Ah ha, found you.
I see you.
-Oh.
Ha ha!
Gotcha.
Alright, you little shrimps,
recess is over.
Oh man.
-Ha! Nobody found me.
Bring it in.
Bring it in.
Time for another...
Don't touch me.
Time for another lesson.
When is Mr. Ray coming back
from his migration?
If he is smart, he'll stay away
from here as long as he can.
But until he does,
I'm your substitute teacher.
Okay, kids.
Who wants to learn about echolocation?
Nobody.
Okay, cupcake.
Have fun.
Nice day for a swim, huh?
Alright.
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.
Well.
I guess we'll go back home and...
brush up on the anemone.
You coming, Dory?
Me? Oh.
I'm just going to the drop-off.
Oh.
Okay.
What?
The drop-off?
NO!
That's-That's-That's a good idea?
Yeah.
I just thought
I go enjoy the view.
Bye bye.
The view.
Well, you have a good time.
All by yourself.
Not.
Not getting... lost.
Oh.
Huh?
No no no...
Dory.
Dory.
Dory.
Hey, Marlin.
-Oh, hey.
Hello, Dory.
You alright?
You looked worried.
No, no, no.
I'm-I'm fine.
It's how I always look.
What?
Well, I just...
You did it.
Huh!
Yay!
-You did it, cupcake.
Yes!
-Did what?
Sweetie.
You just followed the shells
all the way back home.
Huh!
Oh my gosh, I did?
All by myself?
-Yeah.
Do you know what
this means, honey?
It means.
You can do whatever
you put your mind to, Dory.
Really?
Look at us go!
Huh!
Mommy, can I go play with them?
Yeah.
-Absolutely!
Go get them, cupcake.
Yeah.
I did it.
Hm.
Hm.
It really is quite a view.
Yep.
Unforgettable.
